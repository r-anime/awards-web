		"blurb": "From big-name sequels to originals with stand-out showings, 2020 was an Action-packed year for anime. Inevitably, some packed more of a punch than others, so the jury strove to pick out the best anime 2020 had to offer for their nominations. Whether it was the highly kinetic animation of huge battle scenes, the wild spectacle of climactic matches, the cohesive aesthetic of a creatively-built world, solid and diverse casts of loveable characters, gripping tragedies, or hard-fought victories, the Action category had it all.\n\nThroughout the jury process, dozens of shows were watched, discussed, and considered for nomination. Many of these had fervent supporters but ended up missing the cut, such as *Toaru no Kagaku Railgun T*, *BNA*, *Senyoku no Sigrdrifa*, and *Promare*. Though these anime had undeniable strong points and deserved consideration, they weren't as widely appreciated by the jury as a whole. With such fierce competition between all the potential nominees, the jury had a difficult task ahead in finalizing their list to a mere three.\n\nDon't let the jury's results fool you; it was a closer race than these final rankings let on. In fact, until the last juror cast their vote, five of the six entries were tied for first place. The top five may have settled where they are now, but no juror would have contested if any of them won out in the end. And with that, this final ranking was thought to be the best representation of the top Action anime of the year.",

		  "writeup": "*Burn the Witch* was a title with many high expectations right off the bat. The adaptation of a new one-shot by Tite Kubo, the author of *Bleach*, inherited an entire fanbase from one of the so-called “Big Three” of shounen. After a disappointing conclusion to his previous work, this was Kubo's chance to show he still knows how to write shounen manga. \n\nThankfully, the fresh start proved to be a good idea for Kubo-sensei. With competent direction by Studio Colorido, the result is a treat for old fans and an alternate starting point for new ones. The novel setting, characters, power systems, and other story elements are all quickly introduced, knitting together a fast-paced introductory arc to what may be the next long-running story in Shounen Jump. However, the experience may feel overwhelming for those unfamiliar with Kubo's work, and the short runtime leads to many unanswered questions.\n\nIn the end, a combination of great chemistry between the main characters Noel and Ninny, bombastic action sequences, praiseworthy art (especially in character designs), and an intriguing connection to *Bleach*, makes *Burn the Witch* a fun, easy-to-watch flick. Only time will tell if it can live up to the lofty expectations placed upon it. The initial impression is a positive one, and despite some hiccups, it is worthy of the bronze medal in the Action Category.",

		  "writeup": "*Deca-Dence* is certainly one of the most captivating original anime to come out of 2020. Its worldbuilding is undeniably fascinating and ambitious in its massive scope but manages to stay stable and effortlessly entertaining thanks to its thought-out pacing. The central duo's chemistry provides for a lot of entertainment while still developing a strong emotional core to their relationship. Not only that, the multiple twists in the narrative are admirably crafted. However, the middle of the show steps away from exploring the world, and the ending lacks the necessary impact to make an emotionally resonant conclusion. \n\nThe animation is consistently strong, with many standout moments in its large-scale battles. However, the character and monster designs are a mixed bag. They're certainly unique, but the cyborg designs are a bit too bizarre and don't mesh with the human characters as well as they could. In addition, the monster CGI, which is serviceable at best, sticks out like a sore thumb.\n\nOverall, *Deca-Dence* is an engaging and well-crafted dystopian experience, with a captivating world, unique narrative, and charismatic lead duo. There are minor faults with its visuals and the consistency of its storytelling, but *Deca-Dence* is ultimately a very solid anime that is deserving of second place.",

		  "writeup": "One of the earlier shows from the year, *Fate/Grand Order: Zettai Majuu Sensen Babylonia* manages to secure the fifth spot in the category thanks to its action-packed story and stellar production.\n\nIn terms of writing, *Babylonia*'s goal is to give enough breathing room to allow for exploration of the servants' personalities and inner thoughts, so that viewers are not overwhelmed with information (this being the eighth arc of the gacha game's story). In this way, the pacing is slow but consistent. That being said, the character writing was the focus of criticism. The main character's bland personality combined with clichéd traits among the supporting cast is the pitfall of *Babylonia* in that regard. Gilgamesh's personality and Merlin's dialogue are notable exceptions and the highlight of many scenes. Add the stellar voice acting to this equation, and *Babylonia* offers a decent mix of personal moments and action sequences.\n\nProduction-wise, the animation's consistently high quality is praiseworthy. This is especially reflected in action scenes, where the fluid movements are a joy to watch. Episode 18, in particular, is one to behold. However, use of CGI throughout the show can make certain scenes less pleasant due to an imbalance in quality. This ends up detracting from serious moments in the show where stakes are high. For these reasons, it takes fifth place on the list.",

		  "writeup": "*Haikyuu!! To the Top* is another strong entry in the beloved volleyball series. This season continues the tradition of exploring its large and varied cast through hype, action-packed matches. *Haikyuu!!* stood out among the nominees with its focus on character growth, as much of the Karasuno squad makes huge strides in their development.\n\nReturning characters such as Hinata and Ryuu face their self-doubts, while additions like Shinsuke Kita offer new perspectives on the nature of hard work and talent to the show. However, this focus on players sacrifices time spent during matches, and the slow pacing of the first half reflects this. While some new characters add fresh ideas to the show, others introduced during the training arc retread old content, are underdeveloped, or lack the chemistry of the main cast.\n\nThe season's second half is a dynamic series of matches filled to the brim with exciting animation and emotional character moments. Highlights include Hinata's receive and Ryuu's straight spike. Unfortunately, some of these tense moments are undercut by subpar production values. While the show certainly delivers top-notch animation when called for, most of the time spent during matches misses the intensity *Haikyuu!!* was known for back in 2016.\n\n*Haikyuu!! To the Top* proves once again why the series is so beloved within the community. With its diverse cast of fun personalities and matches full of hype, the show earned a respectable fourth place in a category filled with strong candidates.",

		  "writeup": "*Boku no Hero Academia* is a mainstay of the Action category. Every season has been nominated for the awards and 2020 is no exception. Director Kenji Nagasaki and his team at Studio Bones once again brought this creative take on the Superhero genre to life with industry veterans such as Kouki Fujimoto and Yutaka Nakamura making their return to the series.\n \nWhile it's a welcome return, the season played it too safe to truly stand out in a year of battling gods, cyberpunk heists, and high school volleyball. The primary story of the first half of the season surrounding Eri and the basic premise of rescuing her from a stereotypically evil Overhaul has little nuance or complexity. Outside of the occasionally interesting battles, there is little here to interest the viewer. The pacing especially is poorly done; while the arc itself is filled with battles, the season takes too long to truly get its engine going.\n\nThe second half does a much better job of innovating on the world and characters. The shift in focus brings new life to the series, and the core conflict of the culture festival with Jirou, Eri, and Gentle Criminal is much more engaging. Topped off with an incredible finale featuring Endeavor, containing some of the best animation of the season, *Boku no Hero Academia* lands at a respectable 6th place for the year.",

		  "writeup": "With its flashy intensity and manic energy backing up topical themes, *Akudama Drive* is one of the most visually unique and well-executed anime of 2020. It mixes Quentin Tarantino's stylized hyper-violence and eclectic ensemble of eccentrics with a cyberpunk backdrop à la *Blade Runner* and a side of *Danganronpa*—and indeed, these are all stated inspirations for the series.\n\nPierrot packed the show with high-octane set-pieces chock-full of astounding choreography and impressively fluid animation. This hype train doesn't just settle on action; the show has the brains to back up its brawn, slamming its topical and hard-hitting plot points and character beats in your face with anarchic glee. Chiefly important is Swindler's arc, where she *clearly* isn't just making things up on the fly as she grows a spine and takes *several* levels in badass, using her guile and wits to give the biggest 'up yours' to totalitarian propaganda in recent memory.\n\nIndeed, *Akudama Drive*'s core message shines brighter than the lurid neon aesthetic of the show's coloring and background art, which is breathtakingly gorgeous and visually distinct - the show looks as good as it acts. Finally, much like the titular rag-tag group of outlaws, *Akudama Drive* plays hard and fast with their takedown of the authoritarian system. Unlike most other modern cyberpunk imaginations, Akudama Drive demonstrates how to truly deal with the themes of neo-noir late-stage capitalism and look amazing while doing so. *Akudama Drive* is truly a worthy candidate for the top spot in the juror rankings!",

However, despite the sheer amount of anime the jury enjoyed, narrowing the nominees down to just three shows was met with surprisingly little contention. After nominations though, ranking the six shows was not as smooth; every show had fervent supporters and only through lengthy discussion could the ranks be decided.\n\nThe six shows both the jury and the public selected truly represent the diversity and excellence of Adventure anime this year. The heartwarmingly beautiful *Pokemon: Twilight Wings*, the thrilling quest for gold of *Golden Kamuy Season 3*, and the poignant and thematically impactful finale that is *Digimon Adventure: Last Adventure Kizuna* were universally loved by the jurors. The publically selected shows, being the friendly VR game adventure *BOFURI*, the intriguing world-spanning journey that is *Majo no Tabitabi*, and the emotional prologue to a well-loved series that is *Re:Zero: The Frozen Bond* were also met with a fair share of passionate fans in the jury. \n\nThe results represent the arduous process of constant discussion and debates, and while there was a fair share of arguments at times, as a jury we collectively appreciate the nominees and our opinions. We wholeheartedly believe our final ranking is the best Adventure has to offer.",

		  "writeup": "*Digimon Adventure: Last Evolution Kizuna*'s take on the coming-of-age narrative was outstanding, utilizing both the nostalgia of a long running franchise and the struggles of growing up and leaving your childhood behind to great effect. Well implemented symbolism and direction made this *Digimon* finale approachable and meaningful, even without prior franchise attachment.\n\nAs the cast approaches adulthood and begin to go their separate ways, their relationship with their Digimon comes to an end as well. Menoa, a new scientist who has already lost her Digimon, draws a strong parallel with Taichi and Yamato, building a point of comparison between them and a path for them to grow significantly as the movie progresses.\n\nThe support those themes, *Last Evolution* uses symbolism like butterflies to signify the change from childhood to adulthood and skies and sunsets to represent the end of their relationships. The storyboarding often isolates characters with shadows and blocking, amplifying their loss, while the color design incorporates a mixture of somber blues and warm and harsh reds to reflect the changing headspaces of the characters.\n\nThe film's primary faults were its overall basic structure, being rather standard and predictable at times, making some important reveals fall flat. And while the primary conflict and some of the new characters fit well thematically, they occasionally come off as simple plot devices.\n\nPacked with homages and references to previous works, but also telling a moving story by itself, *Last Evolution* has something to offer to longtime fans and newcomers alike. The thematic depth and strong character building earn *Last Evolution* its nomination and high ranking overall.\n",

		  "writeup": "*Hakumei no Tsubasa*, or *Twilight Wings*, is an incredible and wholly welcome entry into the Pokémon universe. Using the cast from the Sword & Shield era of games, it highlights the charming daily lives of Pokémon users. While not treading any particularly new ground, *Twilight Wings* executes the themes of the main series perfectly. It shows us the beauty of partnership with one's pokémon while highlighting the diversity of trainers and ultimately demonstrating a sense of community beyond one person's adventures.\n\nThe compact, episodic nature of the show tells well-paced stories about the different types of people that inhabit the world. Trainers, children, and champions alike all have their own worries, dreams, and aspirations. The concept of companionship with one's pokémon shines in *Twilight Wings*, examples being Nessa reconnecting with a Milotic, Bea training with her fighters, and Hop and his Wooloo growing closer together. Additionally, the attention to detail is incredible; the characters and their pokémon are expressive, the world is full of life, and the complementary music and the set pieces serve well to set the tone, be it loss, wonder, frustration, or determination.\n\nOverall, *Twilight Wings* as a whole is an exceptional piece of work. There is no intimate knowledge of the series necessary either; each episode is presented in such a way that emotional investment comes naturally, even for those with no prior attachment to the franchise. This low barrier of entry combined with the quality of the work gave it an easy nomination for the category and a natural first place win.\n",

		  "writeup": "*Bofuri*'s interesting premise, occasionally impressive production, and fun cast attracted a large fanbase . Maple's curious and enthusiastic personality makes her a delightful protagonist, and the large supporting cast of friends are swept away by her energy. This low-stakes adventure focuses less on grand plots and more on a group of friends enjoying themselves in a video game. With it's comedy, character interactions, and moments of incredible animation, *Bofuri* makes a name for itself by being the most light-hearted, fun, and wholesome entry in this category, and this popularity even led to cameos for Syrup and Oboro in *KimiSen*.\n\nWhile the adventures of Maple, Sally, and their friends were a fun time, the lack of urgency and emotional impact compared to the other nominations led to its lower placement. Over time, *Bofuri* struggles to set itself apart from similar overpowered video game MC shows. After the initial premise sinks in, it begins to follow the same formula of growing the cast and gathering even more strength. The ways Maple is able to acquire her skills are a little too convenient and weaken the concept's credibility. \n\nMaple and Sally's adventures are one of the more enjoyable representations of the VRMMO setting in recent memory. The show has some small missteps in execution and plays it too safe overall, which leaves some potential on the table, landing it fifth place overall. Despite that, it's never a bore to watch Maple and the gang decimate their opponents in creative and unexpected ways, and *Bofuri* always leaves you smiling.\n",

The new character grouping introduces new interactions that keep the show feeling fresh, especially as this season takes everyone into Karafuto, a Japanese territory attached to Russia. \n\n*Kamuy*'s strong suit remains its well-rounded cast, using its variety of characters to create a balance between the story's serious and comedic moments. Seeing how the 7th was brought together before the start of the story through flashbacks added some much needed character to the former foils. It goes to great lengths to show why each of them is so loyal to Tsurumi. In addition, *Golden Kamuy* makes a strong use of history that helps to understand the time period. The show is a consistent adventure, filled with plenty of character driven action and comedy. \n\n*Golden Kamuy* maintains a high bar with the writing and attention to history work hand in hand to create a dramatic and comedic adventure.

The locations she visits are interesting spins on common fantasy and adventure settings, with Elaina's reactions to each episode's story enhancing the travelogue experience.\n\nOne of the main hooks is Elaina's charming self-confidence and skill as a witch. She herself has a limited worldview, but at the same time she's eager to explore and learn. These traits make her an interesting character whose outlook enhances the varied stories throughout her journey. Unfortunately, Elaina's strong personality and traveler's mentality occasionally comes across as detached or callous. This makes it hard to stomach some of the things we see within the show, and sensitive topics such as abuse or depression may be poorly portrayed. On that note, the show struggles tonally, jumping from adventure and comedy to more dark and serious. \n\nThese drastic jumps are partly because of the episodic nature, but this structure also helps show off a variety of cities and countries. Within those locations the author has taken realistic quirks, such as pride in a local specialty or an odd law/tradition, and exaggerated them, creating an engaging chain of places for Elaina to visit during her travels.\n\nAll in all, while the show's tonal shifts can be abrupt to the point of whiplash, *Majo no Tabitabi* captures the essence of travelogue adventure very well. Combine that with its impressive visuals, and you have a quality adventure.\n",

Long before Subaru is in the picture, *Frozen Bond* gives insight into Emilia's personality and her struggle with her heritage, setting the stage for future seasons.\n\nSimilar to the main series, this OVA prioritizes showcasing the characters' inner thoughts and their psychological conflict. In particular, the OVA emphasizes the prejudices Emilia faces from the moment she's released from her crystal form and her insecurities in acting well towards those who reject her. It gives context and backstory to Emilia and Puck's relationship, strengthening their father/daughter-esque bond in an otherwise lonely world.\n\nNeedless to say, the core of Emilia's small tale is presented well, but there's still a lot that is left unexplored. This prologue gives some backstory and world building, but still leaves many unanswered questions and offers little new characterization; Emilia is pretty much the same as she is in season one. For those reasons, the OVA is mainly just a small addition to Re:Zero as a whole and it loses out compared to other nominations that were fleshed out with better quality and structure.",

From the raunchy *Ishuzoku Reviewers* that took the community by storm to the avant-garde claymation in *Bessatsu Olympus Kylos*, the nominees this year tested the limits of what anime could be. Beloved comedy series from previous years revived in the form of *Konosuba: Kurenai Densetsu* and *Kaguya-sama Season 2*, bringing back familiar characters as if they had never left. *Kakushigoto* and *Hamefura* were praised for their well-written, character-driven humor, with one exploring a unique and wholesome father-daughter relationship and the other following an energetic princess in a reverse harem isekai setting.\n\nThroughout the jury process, each show was discussed in depth with regard to not just the comedic quality, but the quality of the anime as a whole. The excellence of this year's roster was evident from the shortlisting phase, with a large number of candidates that were not ultimately nominated, such as *Princess Connect*, *Jashin Dropkick Season 2*, and *Ongaku*, receiving considerable acclaim by individual jurors nonetheless. The final voting was similar; almost every entry was placed in first or second place by at least one juror. Still, the overall matchup results meant that these rankings most accurately reflected the jury's opinion as a whole.",

The comedy is fast paced and pretty off-the-wall, traveling back and forth from ancient Greece to modern times to compare customs and set up punchlines on how the Olympics were back then versus today. It doubles down on this random humor with an absolutely wild set of twenty-four EDs featuring real life people and ridiculous lyrics, oftentimes being one of the highlights of the episode.\n\nHowever, with its short runtime and almost purely comedic-focused nature, it doesn't leave a ton to latch onto if the humor is not landing. There is a loose story that exists mostly just to set up new jokes, and the characters don't go through any big developments or character moments to make them much more than just vessels for punchlines. Some of the jokes also started to feel a bit overused by the end of the show, which is unfortunate since it is pretty creative in multiple other areas. \n\nWhile the more conflippy nature of a short focusing entirely on comedy led it to end up just behind some of the other entries that were more consistent, it is still absolutely worth watching if you are a fan of the type of humor it provides.",

The silly satire of the manga industry takes more of a back seat to the main event: a father trying his best and going to truly outlandish lengths for his daughter. Their relationship is the core of the show and is incredibly heartwarming and endearing. \n\nThe absurd actions taken by Kakushi to hide his job and their accompanying misunderstandings are really funny, but they always tie back to some legitimate insecurity that makes these gags hit hard emotionally as well. It's one thing to joke about a girl being lonely, it's another to tie that back into her home situation and how she doesn't have a mother and she's okay with that because her father loves her and does his very best for her. *Kakushigoto* lands this aspect to a terrific degree, getting the viewer to understand how much they care about each other and balancing the serious with the comedic well.\n\nSure, *Kakushigoto* isn't perfect. Some of the jokes become tired and start falling flat in the final few episodes, and it has maybe the most controversial ending of the year. But it has an amount of heart and humor that are hard to match up to, and that's why it walks away with the silver medal.",

Katarina is the strongest aspect part of the show: her kindness, hard-working attitude, and stupidity make for a very likable combination, creating a character that is both hilarious and fun to follow. Her unwittingly avoiding flags by making friends with everyone is the main appeal of the show. She constantly helps people without a second thought, even when she thinks it might lead to a “bad ending”. She is the driving force behind every joke, almost every event, and the series itself.\n\nThe major flaws are the other elements. Her friends have very limited characterization, and they do not interact with each other much at all outside of their relation to Katarina. The anime becomes weaker as it goes on, losing some of its comedic charm as she stops avoiding flags and the series starts focusing more on comedic harem moments. To make matters worse, the production isn't anything out of the ordinary. As such, while Katarina does her best, she is not enough to carry the show entirely despite its promising start.\n\nThese flaws were enough to hold *Hamefura* back compared to the other nominees in spite of the strong lead character, resulting in its fifth place position.",

A human, an elf, a halfling, and an angel walk into...a brothel? *Ishuzoku Reviewers* takes the fantasy genre in a rather risqué direction as the typical adventurer party heads not into danger, but into sexual delight. Nevertheless, it's not your typical sausage party; they're on a mission to experience and review all sorts of different fantasy species brothels in an imaginative take on otherworldly sex. With a unique and creative premise, this show turned out to be one of the most interesting comedy anime of 2020.\n\n*Ishuzoku Reviewers* had exactly one job, and it did that job until the end, with each episode exploring newer and never before seen ways to get laid. When the show pushes boundaries, like the gender-changing episode or the egg-laying episode, it highlights a type of intriguing innovation that makes the show engaging. However, when the show is simply going through the motions, it can feel like a repetitive, cheap excuse for fanservice. The comedy in the show is noticeably weak with uncreative raunchy humor, and the characters are barely developed enough to be memorable. If the gimmick of a particular sex shop falls flat, the episode is left with little value otherwise.\n\nIt's not surprising that a one trick pony fails to compare with other shows that have strengths beyond that, but *Ishuzoku Reviewers*' hard commitment to its premise is praiseworthy. It may have to settle for sixth place here, but perhaps it is the perfect 10/10 for another species of anime watcher.",

Kazuma, on the other hand, deals with what he believes to be his “popular phase” with women.\n\nWith J.C. Staff taking the reins, fans will notice a significant change in animation, but visual mainstays, such as the facial expressions, the over-the-top spectacle of Megumin's explosions, and Kazuma's notorious hand animation, remain. The *KonoSuba* movie also preserves the comedic style of its previous two seasons, even through the climactic finale.\n\nWhile the B-plot about Kazuma's alleged popularity seems intriguing, the execution falls flat in a lot of parts of the movie. There are a handful of funny moments, but for the most part Kazuma's behavior can come across as awkward and irritating. Aqua and Darkness are unfortunately sidelined for most of the movie, playing a supporting role this time around.\n\nOn a more positive note, Megumin and Yunyun make great work of their screen time, having their characters develop throughout the movie. It gives more insight on their relationships with the other members of the village and showcases more of Kazuma and Megumin's relationship. Both of them grow to be able to work together, and improve themselves up into the climax.\n\nThe comedy and characters of the series are definitely an acquired taste, but the *KonoSuba* movie is quite a treat for fans to watch.",

It's also less reliant on the main couple's chemistry, as the increase of screen time for side characters allows existent relations to evolve. Moreover, the character additions change the dynamics among the cast and lead to more creative scenarios and interactions. The most notable difference is the addition of dramatic arcs for Yuu Ishigami and newcomer Miko Iino, which were a positive addition to the otherwise comedic tone of the show.\n\nAll of this is brought to life with exceptional production values.

As a result, this makes it that much more difficult for the viewer to feel any strong attachment to the results of the matches.

		  "writeup": "In contrast to its first season, *Fruits Basket*'s second season places a much greater emphasis on the Soma family and the curse that afflicts its members for what proves to be a worthy sequel to the 2019 show. Its narrowed focus allows the series to hone in on its central themes of overcoming upbringing and growing into your true self, offering plenty of emotional moments and intriguing backstory.\n \nThe character exposition and development of the Zodiac family members is the show's biggest strength. In particular, Yuki's struggles with social awkwardness, opening up to the people around him, and overcoming Akito's all-encompassing influence give much needed depth, relatability, and thematic relevance to the character. The visuals and sound design, while not extravagant, also complement the story very well and amplify key emotional moments.\n \nThe show does have its issues. Akito is poorly developed as an antagonist and thus very one-dimensional, lacking clear motivations or internal struggles. The show's melodramatic nature is tonally hit or miss, occasionally breaking immersion. This is an issue particularly with Rin's subplot.\n\nHowever, despite some minor flaws, Fruits Basket's second season is still some of the best that Drama had to offer in 2020, and its third place finish reflects its quality of storytelling.",

		  "writeup": "*Violet Evergarden Gaiden* continues its parent series' strengths: telling engaging and emotional stories with compelling, realistic characters. Also carried over are spectacular visuals, showcasing amazing art and animation, boosted even further with the increased production values of a movie. \n\nThe first half as a whole felt distinctly stronger. Isabella's parallel situation to Violet in terms of secludedness and social awkwardness allows for strong chemistry between them and makes her story resonate easily and deeply. Her arc functions well on its own and is tied off nicely while providing a nice transition into the next act, focusing on Taylor.\n\nGoing into the second act however, the movie starts to fall off in quality. The story itself grows to be less engaging, and Taylor herself doesn't help as an initially less endearing character when compared to Isabella. Taylor's very childish tendencies, yet sometimes too mature perceptions, make it hard for the viewer to connect with her. There were also pacing issues stemming from the two-part structure, with it feeling more like two separate extended episodes than a cohesive story, and slow progression caused the second half to drag. \n\nIn the end, *Violet Evergarden Gaiden* didn't always hit the mark with its new characters, but it retained the franchise's usual heart-wrenching moments and a strong message.",

Regardless, the jury's dedication to finishing their assigned work on time led to Romance 2020 being the first category to put out their assigned discussion. [The discussion on Yesterday wo Utatte can be read here](https://www.redd.it/jyebn4).\n\nAs has been the case in years prior, there are few 2020 anime which can be considered to be primarily focused on Romance. Upon consideration of this, one could be led to believe that the Romance jury would quickly reach conversational heat death very quickly. However, where the category itself lacks, its jury thrives. Few categories can boast about having tens of thousands of messages discussing their prospective nominations (interspersed with kibitzing about a plethora of varyingly relevant topics), and only this one can say as much about such a limited yet diverse agglomeration of allocations. Entries in this category have a wide variation in focus, ranging from bombastic spectacle in *Tenki no Ko*, wishy-washy will-they-won't-they love triangles like in *OreGairu Kan*, and the everyday life of a new couple as seen in *ToniKawa*.\n\nIn the process of picking nominations, the entire jury watched almost all of its allocations. It was a challenge for the jury to come to a consensus over what three entries best represented the top Romance anime of 2020. Several of the allocated entries were highly divisive and sparked many a heated debate, like *Oregairu Kan*. Some others were nigh-unanimously disfavored, like *KanoKari*. Some jurors pushed hard for shows which barely missed the final cut, such as *Yesterday wo Utatte*. Others backed shows that stood little chance against their fellow hopefuls, like *Komatta Jii-san*. At the end of the process, though, the jury felt that it had come up with something agreeable yet genuine for its nominations. In combination with the nominations provided by the public voters, the jury was given the task to order the six best anime of the category. This final ranking is a curated list of excellent anime recommendations, and represents the fruit of the jury's months-long discussion.",

		  "writeup": "Rural teenagers often butt heads with their elders when deciding whether they should pursue their big city dreams or stay with their familiar, tight-knit communities. Through a supernatural occurrence, *Sora no Aosa wo Shiru Hito yo* provides the opportunity for two sisters, Aoi and Akane, to examine and understand their life choices through finding and rekindling love with both the younger and older selves of Shinno, a guitarist who was an instrumental influence in both girls’ pivotal life decisions.\n\nWhile the initial premise is a solid one, the film doesn’t deliver as effectively as it could. Time wasted on pointless secondary characters could have been better spent exploring the older pairing of Akane and Shinnosuke. A deeper understanding of Akane’s feelings about staying in the country instead of following young Shinno to Tokyo could have given clarity to the emotional payoff at the climax of the film. Similarly, some of the movie’s supernatural elements felt unnecessarily tacked on; especially the flying segment towards the end which felt like a somewhat unearned emotional outburst.\n\nIt is certainly easier to understand the draw of the titular blue sky and country landscape when they are so beautifully represented through gorgeous background art and compositing. Owing to its intimate focus on music, the film also boasts a solid OST and intricate animation of guitar performances. In the end, *Sora no Aosa* reminds us to strive to succeed in life and in love, despite the obstacles that may come our way.",

The first season of *SaeKano* established a solid harem/romcom series with strong female heroines, and the second season started to deal with heavier drama as well, but the series has never been exceptional in any one aspect. This forms an adequate foundation yet leaves something to be desired, and the movie wants to advance the TV anime by narrowing its focus and delivering a conventional romance with a clear goal in mind.\nRight off the bat, the film shows off the strengths from the show with several funny scenes of intriguing character interactions. At the same time, this portion of the movie is also its weakest, as it drags on for a little too long with no real direction given.\nAfter picking up on the plotline, *SaeKano Fine* works fantastically towards closing off all loose ends. The arcs of the three heroines are developed with heartfelt, dramatic scenes, taking great advantage of what was built up previously in the series. The lengthy post credits scene further extends on the motif of conclusion and does great to further the feeling of satisfaction left by the film. As such, the latter half of the movie serves as an outstanding display of how to finish a romance show with multiple love interests.",

		  "writeup": "In a year where loss and grief were so prevalent, *Kimi to, Nami ni Noretara* tells an engaging and relatable story. The movie serves as an excellent exploration of the grief of losing a loved one and finding ways to overcome the tragedy and move forward. \n\nThe spontaneity and breeziness of Hinako and Minato's initial courtship is among the most refreshingly romantic sequences of the year; their strong chemistry and bubbly interactions are incredibly heartwarming. This makes the sudden tragic event that tears them apart even more heart-wrenching to watch. Perhaps even more engaging is the way that Hinako clutches onto the fantastical hope that Minato is still with her in spirit, even while her friends urge her to accept reality and find her own unique path in life. The resulting progression of the plot and character arcs keep viewers engaged and produce a heart-warming story that resonates profoundly with the audience.\n\nIf that weren't enough, the narrative is elevated by the movie's amazing visuals; its animation, composition, and background art are all stellar and all of that makes it one of the most impressive movies in this category from a production standpoint. The sharp sound design and the charming way that the song “Brand New Story'' is used as a recurring theme to track Hinako's emotional state also stands out. All these factors combine to make *Kimi to, Nami ni Noretara* the best Romance anime of 2020.",

Hodoka and Hina's playful banter contrasts with Suga's family problems to create engaging drama that never feels forced. This helps pave the way for the final act of the movie. Although some awkward exposition makes the final act a little messy, the emotional core and character development more than make up for it, presenting a satisfying conclusion for the movie's characters.\n\nVisually, *Tenki no Ko* maintains the high production values of a Shinkai movie. The photorealistic background art and fluid animation blend together in a way that makes the movie a treat to watch, in spite of one or two clunky CG scenes. The strong sound design during rainfall and the well-animated water effects also add to the immersion.\n\nShinkai is at his best when portraying intimate stories with a universal message. The relatable and poignant character moments within this particular intimate story, the showcasing of the movie's message, and its high production values make *Tenki no Ko* a great romance movie, and places it as the second best romance anime of 2020.",

		  "writeup": "*Tonikaku Kawaii: Over the Moon for You* is not a complex show. It drops little bits of lore that hint at something hidden beneath the surface, but by and large, it's a standard romcom. There's nothing wrong with that, of course. It doesn't intend to be a genre-defining work, and it shouldn't be faulted for not being one. That being said, even when viewed with that mindset, it has a number of issues that leave it last in the rankings.\n\nOne of the major issues with *ToniKawa* is its failure to utilize its main concept in a meaningful way. Nasa and Tsukasa are married on paper, but they act more like a high school couple that just started dating. *ToniKawa* uses their marriage as a way to differentiate itself from the crowd, without actually bringing anything new to the fluff romance formula. There also isn't much depth to any of the characters, which is a big problem for a character-focused comedy. Most of the side characters feel one note and one dimensional. Nasa is a bland protagonist, and the relationship between the leads focuses more on physical attraction than anything else.\n\nThere are still things to like about *Tonikawa* though. Nasa and Tsukasa's interactions are pretty cute. The mystery behind Tsukasa's past is quite interesting, and it's a great way to keep people invested in a fluff show like this. Some of the side characters have some good moments as well. The Arisugawa sisters are a welcome change of pace, and help to keep the main couple from overstaying their welcome. Unfortunately, those positive aspects aren't enough to outweigh the show's flaws. It's easy to see why *ToniKawa* is so popular, but its cluttered roster and failure to execute on its premise leaves it in last place among the nominees.",

Much like its characters however, it is an imperfect work of art albeit surely deserving of the praise and high following it has.\n\nThe latest installment of the series showcases its characters mostly (though undeniably not perfectly) developed, coming a very long way from their high-strung, generally isolated selves in the first season. In terms of both interpersonal and intrapersonal relationships and communication, *Oregairu* is and always has been tough to beat. This, coupled with solid aesthetics, passionate voice acting, and a touching soundtrack, makes for an overall fine piece of art.\n\nNonetheless, the show felt dragged out at various points, taking much longer than needed to reach the obvious final confession. Moreover, the dialogue may sometimes be overly complicated, often failing to effectively communicate the character’s thoughts and intentions to some viewers, clouding much of the anime’s appeal.\n\nDespite its noteworthy, but redeemable flaws, *Oregairu S3* still fulfills its fans expectations as the finale of the *Oregairu* series. The show genuinely deserves fourth place among the nominees, and is one of the most memorable Romance anime of 2020.",

Hina and Natsumi's friendship feels very authentic and their interactions are a consistent delight. There are some issues with the President's underhanded tactics and snarky attitude in the beginning, but she grows to a place of genuine love and care that's really nice to see. Oono unfortunately is fairly forgettable, and the teacher is an active detriment -  her obnoxiousness is highly jarring against the coziness of the rest of the cast.

Nijigasaki*, the latest entry in Sunrise's storied *Love Live* franchise, represents the pinnacle of its franchise and is one of the most heartfelt slice of life series of 2020.

That isn't to say there are no stakes, far from it, such as Yuu's heartfelt confession to the stoic student council president who most certainly isn't secretly an otaku and/or idol, or the resident school idol (pun intended) worrying about people not appreciating her true self.\n\nIt's the adorable and heartfelt character moments like this that provide ethos to the series, which augments the stunning Idol sequences. The CGI MV's from *Nijigasaki* give the fluid and dynamic dance numbers from *iM@S* a run for their money, as can be seen through the entertaining dance choreography and dynamic cinematography that's all backed up by amazing seiyuu performances and the franchise's ever-excellent music. Given *Nijigasaki's* adorably charming character interactions, surprisingly deep and well-written dramatic moments, and high-quality Idol MVs, *Nijigasaki* has well earned its fourth place spot.",

Set in Hokkaido and depicting an actual working environment (albeit with plenty of eccentricity), *Nami yo* grounds its characters and plot.\n\nMinare Koda, voiced by Riho Sugiyama, provided *Nami yo* with a boisterous and refreshing female protagonist, a working adult more concerned with rent and paychecks than friends or highschool clubs. While Sugiyama's portrayal gave *Nami yo* a fun and energetic lead, her impulsive personality was occasionally tiring or annoying.\n\n*Nami yo* unfortunately relies too heavy on Minare to pull the narrative's weight, especially amidst a deluge of confusing or otherwise eccentric episodes midway through — some of which stretch the otherwise realistic setting of the series. Another sticking point is the lack of a more engaging supporting cast: many are confusing or unlikeable. Even some of the more engaging ones, like Mizuho, need more development to truly shine.\n\nDespite these faults, at its the core *Nami yo* is a surprisingly tender look at the merits of a neglected medium — particularly in its final arc that touches upon its continued relevance and reach even in an era that has progressively discarded it from its mind. \n",

While there are occasionally great moments from the characters or interactions, for the most part the show fails to deliver on the comfy goodness that made its predecessor so beloved.\n\nThe title Heya Camp is interesting, because the girls neither stay in a room (heya) nor do they camp. Instead, the three members of the Outdoor Activities Circle participate in a local stamp rally, visiting a bunch of locations presumably based on real-world places in Yamanashi Prefecture. While the focus on their city provides some interesting insight into the characters' lives, it greatly diminishes the relatability of the show compared to a general topic like camping; a lot of local references makes the show suitable mainly for people who reside in or are familiar with the prefecture. The pacing of the show is rushed, which is unavoidable given the short total runtime. However, the biggest detriment to Heya Camp is the relative lack of Rin and having Nadeshiko attached to Aoi and Chiaki the entire time, very fixed character dynamics that become repetitive throughout the short. The OVA does feature some Rin solo camping, providing an excellent return to form. If the show had more screen time to include all the characters and develop them at a relaxed pace, then it would be better equipped to utilize its outstanding cast and peaceful atmosphere to deliver a comfy experience.",

		  "writeup": "*ID: INVADED* is a show that thrives on its interesting and complex main character, Narihisago. He is a realistic, multifaceted character with a fleshed out backstory that is explored thoroughly throughout the runtime of the show. The two particular episodes centered on him are among the best of the year, with some heart wrenching moments and a brutal, realistic fight scene. \n\nOne of the show's two major problems is its side characters, who are underdeveloped and often boring. Both Hondoumachi and Fukuda are interesting by themselves, but they fail to be more complex than one idea. The rest of the cast is completely bland and replaceable, with everyone in the investigation unit having no personality traits whatsoever. *ID: INVADED*'s biggest problem is its ending, which flies off the rails, while simultaneously feeling predictable. It didn't retroactively ruin the show, but it did bring down the overall experience. \n\nThe show did do very well with the individual cases, however. They each showcased a particular concept in an interesting way. They also demonstrate each killer's mindset and why they think that way. This characterization through each murderer's subconscious leaves a lot of deeper ideas open to interpretation, while also effectively and clearly conveying their fundamental motivations.\n\nOverall, *ID INVADED* has some great ideas and executes them well, but neglects other key elements of the show to explore them. As a result, the series deserves a spot on this list, but the lack of consistency makes it hard to place higher.",

		  "writeup": "*Munou na Nana* is a quintessential popcorn thriller. The story quickly jumps into a monster of the week format that follows Nana as she carries out her mission to defeat the “enemies of humanity”. Fortunately, the show is at its best when it is actively focused on Nana and her work. These moments are tense, exciting, and set the tone of the show.\n\nThe cast is simultaneously a highlight and low point of the show. On one hand we have Nana, Michiru, and Kyoya, all compelling characters who drive the narrative and obtain meaningful character development through their relationships with each other. On the other hand there is the rest of the cast, who are entirely one note and are just a little bit too gullible to be believable. \nThe main problem with *Munou na Nana* is the ending, or lack thereof. While it does manage to wrap up Michiru's character arc meaningfully, it doesn't provide a satisfying conclusion to the story. In a show where the resolution to what is happening is paramount, the non-ending is a major knock against it.\n\nOverall, *Munou na Nana* is a fun, fast paced show that delivers the thrilling experience of watching Nana carry out her mission. It reaches its highest points when it focuses on that, but ultimately the problems with the writing and the ending lead it to a 6th place ranking. \n",

Instead, the audience learns about the world of *Dorohedoro* through its cast of chaotic idiots and their struggles to achieve their goals. For example, the protagonist, Kaiman, is a man cursed with a lizard head who chomps on sorcerers in hopes of one day finding the one responsible for his reptilian form. That is a pretty normal Tuesday for everyone. \n\nDespite the seeming randomness, the story is expertly written. It crafts and navigates a web of figuring out who knows what. It knows when to revel in the ridiculous and when to be serious. \n\nUnfortunately, *Dorohedoro* is only an introduction to the actual meat of the story itself, and the lack of a conclusion can feel unsatisfying. While an entertaining ride, comedy relies heavily on absurdism. Characters are indifferent to the suffering of others they do not personally know, which can make them difficult to root for. And of course, the show makes heavy use of CGI animation. This technique brings *Dorohedoro's* detailed character designs to life no matter how demanding the action is, which cannot be as easily done with 2D. However, it is obvious. That alone can make this a polarizing watch.\n\nOverall, *Dorohedoro* is a must for anyone with a taste for absurdist humor. It is a breath of fresh air for creativity aficionados. But while its weaknesses are understandable, they are major factors into whether the show is engaging at all. Third place still gives it the praise it deserves.",

While previously this resilient band of whimsical heroes had to survive the unforgiving cruelty of the first few layers, this time around they are to overcome the intimidating obstacle that is Bondrewd, who, through an obsessive devotion for science, embodies one of the key themes of the series: the Lovecraftian horror of madness.\n\nOnce again, Kinema Citrus did an amazing job adapting author Akihito Tsukushi's endlessly imaginative world. The background art and animation are once more topnotch, and acclaimed composer Kevin Penkin returned to score yet another brilliant OST. All of these elements are woven together to create a suspensefully thick and sinister atmosphere that reverberates through every nook and cranny of this movie.\n\nDespite all of this praise however, the movie is not without flaws. While most of the cast, particularly Nanachi and Prushka, are allowed to shine, the protagonist Riko is mostly passive and inconsequential to the plot. When the solution to reaching the next layer appears to her, it ultimately feels like an unearned deus ex machina.\n\nBut without question, the story that unfolds is still one of the most gripping and compelling of the year. Through Bondrewd and the Abyss's impenetrable atmosphere, the audience are shown the grit and vulnerability of the main characters, and, much more subtly, the effect the titular void has on its delvers. The end result is an entry that undeniably cements itself in second place.",

All of the cast members have an individual arc dedicated to exploring their hidden past. With a narrative style focusing on the cast pulling off their scams via a series of high stake bluffs, and an art style replete with color and wow-factor, *Great Pretender* makes for an exceptionally entertaining show.\n\nThe main flaw of the series however, comes down to fluctuation in the quality of writing for individual arcs, with the final arc in particular testing the limits of how far the suspension of disbelief can go. While *Great Pretender* does so many things right with its cast, visuals, and general entertainment value.

This season brings a noticeable change of pace, a vibrant cast of characters, and an improved narrative to boot.\n\nCharacter writing was a major point of praise and Subaru especially was a highlight. In just 12 episodes, a great deal is learned about what made him the way he is, how he thinks, and how he changes for the better. A particularly strong moment is when the show offers an intimate look into Subaru's troubled past and how that shaped him into who he is now. Echidna is another standout from the cast. Her unpredictable nature, eccentricity, and coy dialogue as she teases Subaru solidifies her place as the most unanimously celebrated aspect of the show. \n\nWhile several side characters did not have much of a chance to shine, a lot of effort was put into giving each a place in the story. Otto, a relatively minor character in the first season, is now given plenty of room to develop some great chemistry with Subaru. Even more minor characters, like the other witches, manage to be captivating. There are also plenty of new developments regarding returning characters: Beatrice, Emilia, and the increasingly mysterious Roswaal all have moments where we get to see new sides to them.\n\nWith an overall better experience than season one and a stronger storyline, the first half of *Re:Zero Season 2* has positioned itself as the clear first-place candidate for this category.",

From the start of deliberations, the jury had a clear favorite in Taichi Mashima, whose dominance in this category cannot be understated. While Taichi himself may not be made of stone, the jury found his characterization and development to be rock-solid. In not-so-close second was Natsuki Subaru, with special praise directed to the exploration of our long-suffering protagonist's relationship with his family. Kanamori and Lala both left the jury with little to complain about thanks to their strong characterization, while the growth displayed by Yuki and Swindler was also well-received. Even the jury's seventh and eight place picks, Hachiman and Ishigami, still received a fair bit of praise, even if the jury felt that they ultimately did not measure up to the other nominees.\n\nIn their hunt for the best main dramatic character of 2020, the jury placed an emphasis on robust, consistent characterization and interesting, engaging development . Characters don't have to change to be considered good or well-written; however, characters in change are often at their most interesting.

Her arc covers a good amount from her learning to accept herself and how she is different from others to learning how to stand up for herself and decide her own future. What really set her apart was the arc where she broke away from instruction. While merely suggestions, it still made her feel limited in what she was supposed to do. So, when she decides to break away it's a nice moment that shows just how much her time on Earth has affected her. \n\nShe has a fun personality that lends itself really well to the rest of the cast and she almost single-handedly gives every scene energy. Watching her learn about humans as an alien and become friends with everyone is incredibly heartwarming. Her relationship with Hikaru develops really nicely throughout the show as well as they both support each other to continue improving. \n\nLala is the embodiment of *Star Twinkles Precure*'s themes, the heart and hallmark of the show. So much so, in fact, that the biggest issue with it (and Lala's character in general) is that there simply isn't enough of her. Of the almost 50 episodes of the series, only roughly eight heavily featured Lala. While these are the best episodes of the series, her relative lack of screen time really holds her back and prevents her from being elevated higher in the category.",

It is especially evident how much growth he has gone through when compared to his introduction in the first season. This is a story about overcoming trauma and moving forward. It speaks volumes that he was able to, in his own way, even stand up to the source of much of this trauma, Akito, when he used to just avoid it as much as possible. In addition to his own efforts of breaking away from his past, we also saw Yuki take the first steps to form serious connections with others. Watching Yuki as he started reaching out from himself and those in close orbit around him to try to interact and connect with the members of his student council, especially the Treasurer, Machi Kuragi, was one of the smaller and more personal moments but also one of the best parts of the season.\n\nIt could be argued that Yuki's character and arc are not as riveting or at least not as strong as other nominees. But still, it was both Yuki's own development and overcoming his issues as well as his attempts to grow closer with others and help them do the same that got Yuki a nomination and eventually placement as the 5th Best Main Character in a Dramatic Role. \n",

Having lost himself into a hopeless limbo of dissatisfaction and critical self-image, fueled by his demanding mentality, the third season presents the most intriguing parts of his tragic arc so far, portraying Taichi fighting for a conclusion to his deadlock situation.\n\nTaichi might be trapped in his circumstances, but its presentation is far from monotonous. Thanks to great visual direction and Mamoru Miyano's resonant performance, Taichi's every victory is underlined by intense devotion and desperation to find a way out through karuta. Still, even bigger impact comes with his defeats, leaving him lost without lifelines.\nThrough delicate characterization, the anime gives a peek on how an exceptional achiever copes with their difficulties: Instead of falling to the deep chasm of self-pity, Taichi tries to overcome obstacles with very goal-oriented actions. However, the highflyer's mentality shows its drawback through Taichi keeping the burden to himself, resulting in isolation from his peers and audience, as his thoughts are shared less and less. Yet, even when quiet and alone in a crowd, the show succeeds to make his inner turmoil loud and clear.\nUltimately, Taichi breaks the silence by giving some of *Chihayafuru*'s most memorable moments, concluding long-established plot points in a melancholic fashion. With actions displaying both the progress done and the room to grow ahead of him, 2020's best dramatic main character's journey gets hearts to bleed, yet makes us ask for more.\n",

At the beginning we're shown some insight to the animation process through Asakusa and Mizusaki, but in the long run it's Kanamori who brings forth the colder and innovation-restrictive side of the industry. The exploration of her worldview during the show brings up the endless that exists underneath the cynical appearance, making her a very relatable character. A pragmatic mind can still be a source of innovation and creativity, as Kanamori's awareness of boundaries of the real world makes her actively try to push the group to greater and more realistic goals.\n\nDue to the directness of her nature, Kanamori has a constant presence in scenes she is in: when she doesn't interrupt Asakusa's and Mizusaki's flow of creativity, it's a silent approval of it - when she does, it affects the direction of the moment. The straight man of the group who always provides amazing wit to make her point, her presence absolutely dominates the show. She has many funny one liners and quips, but it's her devotion to success that makes her stand out. \n\nKanamori is the glue that keeps *Eizouken* together.

Starting out as an outcast among criminals, Swindler quickly learns to think on her feet in order to trick the criminals and fit in among her ranks. While attempting to fit in she develops more into the persona she has had fabricated by learning survival tricks to keep her and eventually the twins safe. The twins are the catalyst for her true change as she starts to learn how to protect others, which doesn't come out of nowhere, as we witness her selflessness by saving a cat in the very first scene of episode 1. \n\nIt's easy to enjoy Swindler's arc of becoming someone strong and capable, especially when she stays extremely endearing and charming throughout it. However, a lack of subtlety is one way to describe Akudama Drive, and Swindler is not exempt from this with her arc being very on the nose. Another downside of Swindler is she feels as if she has no agency in her change, as she is forced into becoming a criminal rather than it being her own decision.\n\nHowever, with Tomoyo Kurosawa turning in a heartfelt performance to sell the stakes her character is going through, Swindler is arguably the best part of *Akudama Drive*. She is an overall fun character to watch which allows her to land neatly in the middle of the list of best Main Dramatic characters of the year. \n",

His story this season was very popular and believed to be competently handled overall. Unfortunately, while his arc was executed well, there were moments that left some room for improvement. The backstory portion could be seen as rather melodramatic. Also, it was felt that there was not a lot of self reflection in his actions. Asocials justifying not getting along with others through superficial judgement is a common phenomenon and talk about “normies” is partly why people relate to Ishigami, but that behaviour gets victimized here more than actually criticized. Ishigami is still the 8th Best Main Character in a Dramatic Role. With a third season announced, it will be interesting to see how Ishigami's character develops from here on.\n",

His anxiety from failing to live up to the standard of success he has unconsciously set for himself, due to the influence of his highly capable and respected father created an incredibly humanizing factor. Coping methods such as trying to escape responsibility and putting up a playful front helps to establish relatable ties for the audience.\n\nThese developments significantly recontextualize the entire previous season of the show, giving meaning to Subaru's boisterous personality during uncomfortable situations. His downward spiral enables his old bad habits to resurface is complimented wonderfully by how well the rest of the cast is incorporated into his journey, from the manipulative influence from Echidna, to the honest and unexpected acknowledgements of friendship from Otto. These encounters work wonders towards clearing his disturbed mind.\n\nEvery trial and tribulation during the first half of *Re:Zero's Season 2* tests Subaru's pre-established developments as a character up to this point. The payoff during the final episode through Subaru's understanding of his value and personal connections further validate his changes in a satisfying manner, leaving us excited for what this revitalized Subaru will be able to achieve in the second half of this arc.",

Despite the production drought caused by the global pandemic, there were plenty of new and interesting personalities brought to the table. At least a dozen or so characters who made their on-screen debuts in 2020 were under serious consideration for nomination at some point or another, so it's interesting that both the jury and the public nominated two newcomers and two returnees. The last time this happened was 2017, when three out of the six nominees came from the second season of Konosuba.\n\nA big theme in the discussions this year was good characters coming from bad shows. The source materials for the four newcomers weren't thought to be especially high quality, but they had protagonists who were interesting enough to overcome that hurdle. The sentiment that a nominee was “carrying” their show was commonly seen, which is just about the highest praise a character can get.\n\nIn the end the *Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai* nominees rose to the top, to the surprise of pretty much no one.

The way she is able to weave stories, intertwine lies, and manipulate facts to suit her needs and solve cases speaks to her determination in performing her duties. \n\nOutside of her role as a mediator she displays a pushy and stubborn nature with her boyfriend and his ex-girlfriend. Her professional image is often ruined with her childish attempts of seduction and abuse of her supernatural powers. Her overly emotional nature and reactions provide a nice foil to the other characters' more mild-mannered personalities. Every aspect of Kotoko's life whether personally or professionally is filled with wonderful banter, witty remarks, and colorful metaphors. Her eccentric personality and dialogue are such an appealing quality of her that she still manages to remain captivating during some of *Kyouko Suiri* questionably paced arcs. A strong character overall but with her sometimes controversial personality and lack of development she lands on a respectable third place.\n",

		  "writeup": "Elaina elicits a strong reaction from almost everyone who sees her. There are few characters from this (or any) year who can match her in terms of sheer personality and screen presence. Most viewers of *Majo no Tabitabi* will walk away either loving her or hating her. For a character who inspires adoration in some and intense hatred in others, fourth is a fitting placement.\n\nThe most common criticism of Elaina is that she's a borderline psychopath and a non-borderline narcissist. Many of the actions she took over the course of the series caused shock and horror from the community at large, and the ones she *didn't* take were even more controversial. She's no saint. She's no hero. She's just a witch who is primarily motivated by self-interest. Many people will love her character for these exact reasons, and many people will feel the exact opposite. But her twisted personality and self-indulgent antics were more than enough to keep her fans coming back each week for more.\n\nThe other major issue is her lack of development. The serial nature of the show means that the (absolutely ravishing) Elaina at the beginning of the show is pretty much the same as the (drop dead gorgeous) Elaina from the end. That's not necessarily a criticism, but it does mean that she's outranked by some characters with a bit more depth. Still, Elaina is one of the most impactful characters to come out of 2020, and with any luck this won't be the last we see of her.\n\n",

She doesn't take her role as a captive in the demon castle seriously at all, which only causes trouble. \n\nWhile the lengths she's willing to go for sleep combined with her complete lack of morals are hilarious at first, the joke quickly gets taken too far. It's also this joke her entire character is based on, making her slightly repetitive, and her lack of morals often makes her seem inhuman. \nDespite the jokes being virtually the same throughout the show, Syalis always manages to make something amusing out of nothing which makes it seem more varied. Even when the show focuses on other characters, she is just as entertaining in the background. \n\nIt's fun to Syalis complete her different quests and gradually build up her relationships with the demons, and eventually start caring a little bit about others, giving her at least a tiny bit of character development by the show's ending, which is a thing she's lacking for the rest of the show. \n\nDespite Syalis' lack of character development and morals, she's still quite hilarious to watch, which made her end up at sixth place.\n",

Her drive to prevent these flags paired with her stupidity makes for a great combination, which all in turn results in insane antics such as becoming a farmer out of the blue in an attempt to learn magic. Meanwhile, she does actually dodge the flags but completely unintentionally, just because of how good of a person she is, constantly helping others without a second thought and befriending the people who were supposed to kill her in the original version of the world.\n\nHer strength as a character in the start is well-recognized, but she does not really change much as a person throughout the series. In the long run, she can become tiring to the viewer as the series goes on, especially because she starts spending less time dodging the flags and more time fooling around with her harem.\n\nWith Katarina still being a fairly likable and funny character, the strength of the other nominees coupled with these flaws were what caused her to be placed seventh overall.\n",

Her strong personality allows her to thrive in this category. That said, this personality is likable while still having a fair share of flaws. Being a character who is much easier to like than she is to hate, viewers are left wanting to see her succeed. Kaguya is all about balance, she can be a genius at one moment and she'll flip the switch to being a total fool.\nThe audience isn't left frustrated by Kaguya's weaknesses because she's constantly growing and her character arc continues forward nicely in the second season. A side effect of her feelings for Miyuki deepening is that she can get even more careless and stupid around the president than ever before. And yet she never completely gets over the somewhat dark thoughts she has about other characters who appear to be getting in the way of her romantic goals. The second Iino mentions Kaguya and the president being suited for each other during the school election arc, the negotiation and Kaguya's plan both fall apart. \nThere is no doubt that Kaguya's relationships continue to deepen both within and outside of the Student Council. Even though Kaguya isn't always honest with herself it is easy to see her true feelings. Kaguya's growth is apparent during the Sports Festival arc, she doesn't hesitate for a moment to offer up her uniform when Ishigami needs it and he doesn't misunderstand her intentions. This girl was one of the most enjoyable characters to watch in 2020 and earned the honor of finishing first in this category.\n",

His almost wholesome moments there and with Megumin throughout the film are just about enough to make up for any misgivings his behavior might incur elsewhere, not to mention his excellent performance as the straight man questioning the absurdity of Megumin's village or any of the other very well-executed gags he's responsible for throughout the film. \n\nWhile not quite as amazing as he is in the TV series, Kazuma is still really good in this movie and a very solid nominee for the category.  \n",

The second season of *Fruits Basket* once again offered plenty of good choices that were hard to narrow down to just one, although it wasn't as hard as selecting the best *Chihayafuru 3* character between Dr. Hideo Harada and the ultimately-nominated Shinobu Wakamiya. *Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru. Kan* offered not only one of the most beloved teacher characters of recent years, but also one of the most intriguing femme fatales. Casts of *Haikyuu!!* and *Re:Zero* remained among the popular favorites, each providing at least one character worth nominating. 2019 supporting comedic joint winner Ai Hayasaka made a return, once again with bipartisan support. And that's not to speak of all the characters that barely missed the cut: *Yesterday wo Utatte*'s one-episode-wonder Chika Yuzuhara that stole everyone's hearts, *Kanojo, Okarishimasu*'s twisted attention-stealer Mami Nanami, or *Nami yo Kiitekure*'s silver-tongued boss Kanetsugu Matou.\n\nAt the end, it was the unique narration surrounding the character of Misaki Shoukohou alongside her complicated motivations that cemented her as jury's winner. It was far from a unanimous decision; each entry on the list had at least one strong proponent and one intent detractor. However, this ranking came as a result of months of deliberation about each character's individual appeal, their plot relevance and how much they underpinned main characters. Let the disagreements speak to the overall strength of anime writing this year - that it provided different parties with a diverse set of characters that each believed to be the best this year had to offer. Which is why each one on this list deserves to be called noteworthy and celebrated.",

Kan*, Haruno Yukinoshita continues to play the role she's been set in as far back as season one, stirring up trouble for a trio of confused teenagers. Using her longer life experience, adept interpersonal skills and high social status, she's able to effortlessly mess with the heads of volunteer club members, exploiting their doubts and insecurities in order to push them in the direction that she deems the best for them.\n\nThis season further explores her own character and motivations, providing a better idea as to why she's so involved with her sister's group of friends, hinting at her own hangups and unresolved issues. The writers did a good job of fleshing her out in a way that is consistent with her prior characterization, giving us further insight into ongoings of the Yukinoshita family and exploring new avenues of the series' prevailing theme of human connections. However, in return, it strips a layer from her aura of mystique, marking a shift in how she's presented to the audience.\n\nThe direction Haruno's story took this season was a little divisive - her personal growth and role in the story were quite subtle, which could leave some unsatisfied. However, she still exhibited her fascinatingly twisted personality and a strong influence on the main cast members, resulting in a fourth place ranking.\n",

One of the characters that stood out the most was Hatsuharu, as he played a vital role in certain story beats.\n\nHatsuharu is an interesting contrast to Tohru in the sense that Tohru's acts of compassion and kindness are rather spontaneous and natural. On the other hand, Hatsuharu is more a thinker who considers what he can do for a specific person before commiting to an act. Being the supportive Soma clan member, it's intriguing how the story shakes up Hatsuharu with the introduction of Rin, portraying him as far less tolerant and mature than he originally appeared. The show does this by having him go berserk as Black Haru and trashing a classroom upon hitting his stress limits, reinforcing Rin's importance to Hatsuharu.\n\nA defining characteristic of Hatsuharu is his dynamic with others. This is both a positive and a negative for him, as it means he interacts naturally with the cast, but he's also bound by them and hampered by bad characterization of others. His interactions with less-relevant Soma members tend to highlight this issue. This aspect coupled with his lack of presence later in the season causes him to fall short of the top slots. Despite that, Hatsuharu is an excellent character who supports the growth of the main cast expertly, which is why he slots in as third place in the category.\n\n",

She is confident in her skills as a karuta player and often dismisses other players who aren't as devoted to the sport as her. The eccentric Queen displays a strong, loving connection with her cards due to social isolation. Without much of a social circle she relies mainly on her family, future rivals, and her own strength, but this season she begins to doubt them to interesting narrative effect. \n\nThroughout the season, Shinobu interacts with more characters and becomes more involved with the karuta community. While in the process of expanding her horizons she encounters betrayals from her family and friends which weakens her mentally. Experiencing doubt and internal conflict reinforces the fact that she isn't the untouchable cold Queen she appears to be. Shinobu is still a fragile high school girl and with the assistance of Chihaya manages to rebound emotionally. The culmination of the tournament shows her expressing gratitude for the people beside her, praising her opponent, and revealing excitement for future challenges.  *Chihayafuru 3* manages to portray Shinobu's struggles and growth organically. Shinobu's overall personality, struggles, and development lands her in a respectable second place. \n",

The beginning segments of the Level Upper arc frequently paint Misaki as a schemer, but the usage of flashbacks and internal monologue helps portray her actions in a different manner. Her backstory not only aids in expanding her personality, but explains why she utilizes such methods and for what reason. Her motivation stems from her desire to protect her childhood friend Dolly and stop the Academy's dark side experiments. The dark side's manipulation of her mental powers results in Misaki's warped view of trust. Her memory manipulation of other people such as scientists, civilians, and Mikoto's friends can be seen as abusive or necessary depending on viewer interpretation. Within a series exploring themes of security and power, Misaki's abilities allow for a unique narrative role.  \n\n\tMisaki demonstrates an impressive mastery of her powers. The end of her arc feels beautiful and well-deserved due to the sheer amount of determination she displays when using every tool at her disposal, manipulating a variety of characters to gain strategic information or remove people who would interfere with her plans.The desire to protect people close to her and distrust of the dark side are traits she and Mikoto share. The two may never be friends, but the shift to acquaintances is wonderful. Her personality, backstory, development, and ideals make her a compelling supporting character earning her the top spot.\n",

This also sets up his role in the second half of the season as a foil to Kageyama, driving him to stop being too accommodating to his teammates and to push them to be greater. \n\nUnfortunately, in *TO THE TOP* Kei serves more as a catalyst for other character's growth than anything else. Consistent follow-through on earlier character development is something awesome to see, but he just didn't have enough of a role this season to overtake our other nominees and make it out of eighth place.\n",

Coming into season two, Beatrice was just another detached goth loli that seemed to know more than she let on, but in this season she both inverts these expectations and shows a remarkably complex and emotional character underneath. Helped by the excellent work of her voice actress Satomi Arai, Beatrice goes through all the stages of grief, changing the mood of the story with every scene she is in. Beatrice's strong and evocative performance emphasizes the major ideas of the first half of *Re:Zero* season two, and also recontextualizes the actions and motivations of Echidna, adding interesting complications to the puzzle Subaru has to solve.\n\nHowever, while she had a great performance, Beatrice lacks agency in the story of *Re:Zero*, presenting more as a plot device than an active character. This isn't a unique problem to her and is even somewhat inherent to the plot structure of *Re:Zero*, but among the many bonds driving Subaru she has relatively low priority. This leads to some of her moments feeling inconsequential or even overblown.

After assessing potential contenders strictly as antagonists, a shortlist of potential nominees was formed, including multiple characters with strong support. Upon establishing nominees, discussion shifted to evaluating contenders as not just antagonists, but as characters overall. Various analytical angles were considered, including different styles of antagonism, how much ambiguity in character writing to forgive for contenders from ongoing series, and how to compare and contrast characters with significantly different amounts of screen time.\n\nHeated disagreements abounded, as nominees like Echidna, Akito, and Rachel divided the jury due to some uncertainty about motivations at this point in their arcs. Most jurors felt generally positive about Bondrewd's diabolical compassion and pursuit of science, but not enough for him to become a frontrunner.

Chihaya learns skills that will help her towards her goal of becoming the Queen.

Harada-*sensei*, a paragon of the traditional style of karuta, even changes his style to an aggressive one to thwart him. Despite his efforts, it's with apparent indifference that Suou plays his matches. This approach infuriates every karuta player who puts endless practice and care into their play, only to see their champion Harada-*sensei* struggle against the upstart. This dynamic makes the viewer want to root against Suou.\n\nOff the karuta mat, Suou is an amicable character. His antagonism is predicated on his karuta play, which diminishes him slightly as a character.

Akito endured a childhood of trauma and fear as he was groomed to head the Soma family, but he ultimately imposes those same types of sufferings onto others, making him a victim turned into an abuser. Akito's threats to characters like Kyo and Yuki are weakened by Soma family politics sometimes being unclear. However, there is never any doubt that the other Somas genuinely fear their family head's godlike wrath. Akito's abusiveness spurs Tohru to intervene, and the conflict between these two transforms *Fruits Basket* from a comfy romance into a struggle against tradition and destiny for the sake of characters that the audience has come to care for as much as Tohru does.\n\nWhile Akito's excessive outbursts are integral to his characterization and benefit from impassioned voice acting, they are sometimes more comically whiny than frightening. Coupled with an unintimidating character design and the frantic clinginess he displays towards some Somas, Akito is not consistently portrayed as the massive threat that he is to the happiness and futures of the other characters. Akito's placement also suffers from some lingering ambiguity regarding his backstory, motives, and the secrets of the Zodiac Curse. These criticisms may be addressed in the show's upcoming final season, but for now, Akito has developed into a complex and thought-provoking character and a worthy fifth place finisher.",

Faced with this stoic front, no other Antagonist this year can match Ogata when it comes to sheer presence. He dominates whatever scene he is in, making both enemies and allies alike take notice. Whether it be through the rumbling voice work of Kenjirou Tsuda, or his unblinking stare in the background as he observes his prey, Ogata demands your attention. \n\nEarly in the season, one might think of Ogata as the black sheep, simply a misunderstood \"good guy\" slowly being brought into the fold. He eats and drinks and jests with the leads as he helps them on their quest, the occasional smirk never quite reaching his eyes. In this way the viewer comes to connect with and understand him, to think of him as one of the gang rather than as an obstacle. All the while he sits and stares, watching in the background as a constant presence, waiting for the leads and the audience to forget one very important fact: Hyakunosuke Ogata is a hunter.\n\nPut simply, Ogata's silent yet threatening presence and the slow build-up of tension it brings throughout the season is incredible while the performance of Kenjirou Tsuda leaves chills down viewers' spines. This all culminates in one of the tensest and most well-executed confrontations between characters of the year, earning Ogata the first place spot.",

One major element he lacks, however, is a backstory in the anime.\n\nBondrewd is one of few characters that are truly despicable. His efforts to act as a father figure to Prushka come off as creepy and perverse, and he conducts human experiments on children without hesitation, for no other reason than for his warped vision of “science.” Even if he knows the children will die, it won't stop him.\n\nOn top of that, he always stays unnaturally calm, serving to enhance how unsettling he is. He is also quite a mysterious character, never taking off his mask, and he doesn't have much of a backstory. While this adds a sense of mystery to him, though, it's odd to hide things about such an important character, and especially when the show is about uncovering mysteries.\n\nAs a character, Bondrewd remains rather underdeveloped, with his motives and backstory not as well explored as they could have been. In spite of this, his strengths as a thoroughly despicable and deeply unsettling obstacle for the protagonists to overcome make for a well-deserved third place finish among this year's top anime antagonists.",

The series keeps her true self and intentions hidden to the viewers. The few moments she's in the show depicts her as being reclusive. However, when the show finally gives her some focus, she's revealed to be a very twisted and manipulative person who displays sociopathic tendencies. Rachel is rather obsessed with achieving her goals, and she will gladly use anyone or anything to achieve it. She's also shown to be self-loathing; she resents her ordinary nature and holds a hatred towards naturally gifted people like Baam. This becomes the fuel for her eventual conflict with our protagonists in the story.\n\nUnfortunately, although her moments near the end of the show are some of the biggest highlights of the show itself, the way the show only makes her act as an antagonist in the last episode is also her greatest weakness. The fact that Rachel is only fleshed out as a character in the last episode leaves her underdeveloped relative to the other nominees. Similar to the anime itself, what is shown is just the introduction to her character, not the extent of her true nature and personality. Taking all of this into account, Rachel finds herself at the bottom of the list.",

Subaru wants to save everyone, give them a better future, and suffer less. Echidna, in turn, wants Subaru to suffer more often and in different ways. She demonstrates inhumanity towards those close to Subaru because she doesn't care about the feelings of people, as the only thing that concerns her is knowledge.\n\nAlso worth noting is her skill in persuasion and deception. Echidna holds back important information, pretending that she is on Subaru's side and manipulating him. As a result, Subaru eventually becomes greedy under her influence, thus demonstrating her crafty, antagonist-like skills and her influence as a character. Her \"mask\" is also impressively deceptive: She acts cutesy and tsundere in less dramatic scenes, thereby evoking sympathy from both Subaru and the viewer.\n\nHowever, it's difficult for her to empathize, which limits her development and role within the story. Her motivation appears loose, for she has no background and rarely does anyone agree with her or approve of her methods. Regardless of that, Echidna is difficult to identify as a threat, as her motives and actions both complicate and facilitate Subaru's path.  That having been said, while Echidna may not behave like a standard antagonist, her introduction to the show adds complexity to the story and further enables Subaru to develop as a character, placing her in fourth place.\n",

This makes the selection process a brutal exercise and trying to properly compare such drastically unique and entertaining casts was not an easy task. Whether it be the irregular gang of hoodlums that inhabited *Dorehedoro*, or the overdramatic and bombastic personalities that made up the entirety of *Akudama Drive*, no show was even relatively similar to another. Along with this, the abundance of sequels this year lead to some intense debate about proper development through seasons. This was an especially present talking point when covering *Re:Zero Season 2* with its unconventional and mysterious supporting cast. There was also an emphasis on the dynamics these characters had with one another, such as the expanded upon relationships in *Kaguya-sama Season 2* that jurors thought boosted the show's placement by a substantial amount.\n\nOverall however, after long hours of debate and conversation, the show that came out on top was a simple, yet emotionally endearing show about a card game, *Chihayafuru 3*. And deservedly so, as after a long seven year hiatus, the show came back stronger than ever by  delivering strong performances and further developing an already multi-faceted cast.",

They are each forced to confront questions about what the others and karuta itself means to them. For Arata, this means learning to share karuta with others. For Taichi, it means coming to terms with his love for Chihaya. The dynamic between the main cast remains excellent.\n\nSupporting characters such as Harada-*sensei* and Kanade have really poignant moments throughout the season, elevating the cast even though they are not front and center. Kanade and her mother are able to use their knowledge of Kimono to help Inokuma in the Queen match. Once Harada accomplishes his goal of getting to the *Meijin* match, his entire karuta society rallies around him to research the unassuming yet terrifying Suou. Suou is an unassuming presence off the mat, casually handing out sweets to competitors, in contrast with the intense aura he has when he's playing karuta. Each character has unique facets, motivations, and flaws, and it makes their interactions fresh throughout the show.\n\n*Chihayafuru* really feels like it has come into its own in this season, fully branching out beyond the karuta club and delving into some deep character development that the show had tiptoed around previously. The result is a riveting character drama deserving of this year's Best Cast award.",

Through these characters, Tsurumi's army becomes humanized. Kiroranke's past is explored during his journey with Asirpa, providing incredible depth to his character. The line between good and evil begins to blur, especially as more is revealed about the mysterious Ogata.  Wilk's development also provides substantial new context to these alliances and Kiroranke's objective this season. The season thus brilliantly explores two distinct cast narratives: the story of Wilk, Kiroranke, and Sofia, and that of Sugimoto and Asirpa. \n\nThe show's entire cast has strong, lasting personalities and extensive backstories, while also allowing opportunities to highlight their goofier sides. This makes for a large cast that feels altogether dynamic, entertaining, and well-developed.\n\n*Golden Kamuy*'s cast checks every box for a high-ranking sequel nominee.

The Akudama are each carried by their unique individual motivations, though they are largely caricatured stereotypes. Still, Swindler and the two children of Kansai are complex enough to elevate the cast above its more trope-y characters. \n\nThe show characterizes its large cast strongly around a single trait to help introduce everyone quickly. For example, Cutthroat is a serial killer with a ridiculously long sentence and is up for execution, so his obsession with the color red reinforces his psychosis. Viewers easily understand the broad picture of what each character is about from the beginning. As the show progresses, it builds on these tropes for some of the cast by revealing nuanced motivations.\n\nThe faux family consisting of Swindler, Brother, and Sister is easily the most well-developed subgroup of the Akudama. Swindler begins as literally “Ordinary Citizen,” becomes a mother to Brother and Sister, and ends as an important figure for the entire region. Brother and Sister are forced to confront their own strange humanity, providing another noteworthy arc.\n\nUltimately though, the show ignores many of its characters to the detriment of a cohesive cast. The characters' interpersonal relationships were generally weak or surface-level. The Executioners served as poor antagonists who didn't challenge or strengthen the core cast with their schemes.\n\nNonetheless, *Akudama Drive* has a memorable cast, even if the show gets wrapped up in its individual personalities a bit too much, and is definitely worthy of its nomination.",

This serves to flesh out both the colorful cast of characters and the equally colorful world they inhabit. These wacky individuals make their magical city come alive and their daily lives thrilling to watch.\n\nThese insane personalities and appearances can be divisive, and viewers will find them either entertaining or annoying. Despite the varying strengths of the individual characters, the chemistry between character pairs are well-crafted and endearing. Dynamic duos such as Nikaido and Caiman or Ebisu and Fujita provide great comedic relief, dramatic tension, and emotional moments, but the interactions between groups felt subpar. The storyline in *Dorohedoro* is interesting, but the majority of the cast members aren't tied strongly to it, giving many of them an unfocused or adrift feeling. This unfocused nature unfortunately bleeds into the dynamics that exist between the different groups, further reducing them to simple or shallow moments.\n\n*Dorohedoro* introduces unique characters with stellar pair interactions, but the show's short run time hinders their development and leaves them little room to grow. While this is an overall good start for a show, many aspects of *Dorohedoro* have little depth and thus land it in fifth place.",

Hinata gets a new perspective on the game when he is forced to watch on the sidelines as a “ball boy.” Aforementioned new faces include Atsuma and Hoshiumi, who are both posed to be the next challenge that drives Karasuno to fight on.\n\n\nThe second half features mostly Karasuno and Inarizaki, with a little bit of Nekoma in the mix. *Haikyuu!!* loves its flashbacks and does an admirable job of highlighting multiple characters on both teams. Hinata and Tanaka received substantial development throughout, though the segments dedicated to the Miya twins are especially noteworthy. The show explores how the twins were compared early on and what originally inspired them about volleyball, while also highlighting the reason behind their drive to win.

Comedy can be a tricky thing to make work and is often highly subjective. Not all jokes will land for all viewers. Even bearing this in mind, a few of the film's jokes stood out as particularly off-color, further weakening the film and its cast.\n\nThe bulk of the movie takes place in Megumin's hometown, the Crimson Demon village. This change in setting provides opportunities to develop Megumin and her self-proclaimed rival Yunyun, exploring both their past and their relationship with each other. Though their development was appreciated, this shift in focus largely sidelined both Aqua and Darkness and consigned them to gag roles, with neither seeing significant development.

However, as a cast entry, the show struggles due to the lack of proper development for the supporting cast and the limitations of its time looping concept.\n\nThe biggest concern with the cast can primarily be credited to Subaru's unique ability, Return By Death. While this mechanic adds context to the overlapping mysteries and allows Subaru to evolve with every timeline, it severely diminishes the amount of substantial growth we can see in the rest of the cast. This leads to many of the newly introduced characters feeling very one-dimensional and static. Since this season introduced such a large amount of new characters, it makes many of them feel forgettable and dull in comparison to previously established characters from the first season.\n\nThe season does not excel at adding characters and developing them properly, but it does do a commendable job at developing its already existing cast (Subaru in particular). Episodes focusing on him not only offered a much needed backstory, but also provided further context for his actions throughout the series. Other recurring characters such as Beatrice, Emilia, and Roswall are given more moments to shine and as a whole feel more fleshed out.\n\nWhile *Re:Zero* shines with its enjoyable main cast and substantial development of its main lead, it is held back as a cast nominee by the “Return By Death” mechanic and its forgettable new characters.",

In doing so, the series takes a more serious tone for half of their main cast, which has mixed results. On one hand, the development of these characters, particularly Ishigami bonding with the ‘normies', is aspirational and well-done. On the other hand, Shirogane himself is left distinctly lacking in growth compared to his leading lady, Kaguya. \n\nOn the comedic side of the cast, *Kaguya-sama* introduces Miko Iino to the student council. Initially an underdog rival to Shirogane's bid for the presidency, Iino provides a fresh perspective on the other council members. Her absurdly rigid, moralizing worldview produces some great laughs, but is ultimately superfluous to the serious arcs these characters undergo. Similarly, Chika still plays a great instigator for memorable comedic skits, but her role is not impactful for the development of the cast.\n\n*Kaguya-sama Season 2* improves well on what was done in the first season, consistently highlighting dynamic relationships throughout.

Incorporating liberal use of animation techniques such as squash and stretch into their animation style allows Trigger to animate the show in a more lively and expressive way. This pairs nicely with some very animation friendly designs that are used to their full effect to create visuals that are easily summed up as “fun”. This “fun” style use is evident throughout *BNA* and is put to good use in the character animation, as well as being leveraged in the fight scenes to add the requisite Trigger flair.\n\n*BNA* is not without its drawbacks and these primarily lay in the noticeable drop in quality during the second half of the show as well as being somewhat lacking in its overall consistency.

On the flip side though, there are parts of the show like the CG bike, Kanto CG, and Hacker's sequence in Episode 11 that feel decidedly clunky when compared to other parts of the show that did well. \n\nThe production for *Akudama Drive* is overall good and the baseline level of animation never dipped to an unacceptable level, but there were chunks of the second half of the show that were decidedly uninspiring. Consistency is an important factor in judging a show's animation, and *Akudama Drive* struggles to hit the highlights all the time. Unfortunately for *Akudama Drive*, the top entries in animation this year were extremely consistent in their excellence. The seventh place ranking for *Akudama Drive* is not a matter of the animation being bad, because it is quite good, but rather the shows above it being better.",

With well choreographed fight scenes, expressive uses of camera movements, and the sheer complexity of the animation, it is no surprise that *Fate/Grand Order: Babylonia* ranks so high on this list.\n\nThe highs of *Fate/Grand Order: Babylonia* are insane, and it feels as if the animation directors' mission is to display a spectacle. It is clear that a lot of planning went into each scene, as the fight scenes showcase clean and flashy animations. The scale of each fight is so large, yet the animators are always well aware of the characters that are present and what actions they would take. The character designs also complement the noble phantasms well, which allows for unique effects to capture the viewer and make the animation more interesting.\n\nAlthough *Fate/Grand Order: Babylonia* does show unique spectacles in its animation, there are still a few issues that stop it from reaching number 1 this year. Oftentimes the uninspired use of CGI takes away from the striking qualities of the 2D animation, which make scenes less impactful to viewers.\n\n*Fate/Grand Order: Babylonia* delivers an absurd amount of sakuga throughout the series, which only highlights how strong second and first place are in this category.",

The show uses various skits and movements to incorporate its animation but within its setting, the only noticeable elements are the art style and bits of animation, using said skits to try to make its way outside the box. \n\n*Kaguya-sama* mostly takes place within Shuchiin Academy, a school, so the creative team has to make use of what they lack, using the aforementioned scripts to take advantage and manipulate the setting. It presents some amazing character movement especially with Kaguya's “dance.” Hair and cloth flow are also nice details to add to the realism and detail. It also makes great use of lighting to really put emphasis on characters. Other than some high-detail scenes, and fluid animation flow, there isn't a whole lot to say about the animation in the show. \n\nAll in all, *Kaguya-sama* lacks excitement and moments for the animation to shine.

On one end is distilled sakuga in the imagination sequences and the girls' final productions, and on the other is more subtle day-to-day actions as they work and brainstorm. \n\nEach of the three mains has distinct body language that also varies depending on their mood. When full of energy, the girls bounce around with large poses that play with the limits of their designs. When deep in thought, their movements are slower and more careful, often with intricately drawn hands and expressions. *Eizouken* also demonstrates how to use animation as an educational tool to teach about the animation process. Adding complexity to the character animations and world designs in real-time visually demonstrates the effects a few extra frames or details can contribute to the final product.\n\nWhat ultimately helps *Eizouken* take a podium spot is its reminder that animation at its core is an expression of reality. Asakusa's designs and how they move are motivated by a balance of being cool and making sense. To that end, anticipation, weight, and inertia are all carefully considered in the character acting. And when Mizusaki animates, she frequently uses herself or those around her as reference. This idea is the fundamental drive of the show, and using animation to execute its themes in both the narrative and the production is exactly what we'd expect from the love letter to animation that is *Eizouken*.\nFor a more in-depth discussion from the animation jury, see the jury's in-depth discussion on [Eizouken]( https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/kbsi7z/ranime_awards_2020_animation_jury_discusses/).",

The wicked choreography and wild framing made for an entertaining experience despite the narrative being rather difficult to parse.\nDirector Seong-Hu Park is a veteran action animator and his touch can be seen and felt all throughout *The God of Highschool*. Action animation arrives in bursts with an impressive level of attention given to the martial arts choreography.  Bombastic camera work tracks the movement and builds upon the animation's strong sense of kineticism. However, this effect is not without mixed results. Overzealous camerawork can leave some scenes difficult to read, and the effect is compounded with in-betweening issues leaving sequences feeling floaty and lacking impact. Outside of the fights, the dialogue scenes often shift to chibi character forms as a cost cutting measure. Dramatic moments lacked any noteworthy character animation but remained consistent.\nBut that's not to take away from the series many highlights. Toshiyuki Sato's [incredible inkbrush sequence](https://www.sakugabooru.com/post/show/128689) and Director Seong-Hu Park's [mo-cap assisted animation](https://www.sakugabooru.com/post/show/131662) are just two examples that rank among the best pieces of animation this year. *The God of Highschool* is a remarkable endeavor in conveying physics-defying movement and technical experimentation.

It's a constant barrage of surreal, detailed imagery. Complex patterns swirl together and morph into different objects continuously, forming new and beautiful shapes in a fantastical pattern. There is more in this sequence alone than most movies have in their entire runtime. That alone might net it a nomination, but the overwhelming combination of quantity paired with sheer quality throughout the movie propelled it to first place.",

Hiroyuki Imaishi understood what he wanted to create for this work, and it's expected that there would be some really fun fight choreography and background animation - but it's also quite a surprising work in how well it utilizes its CG in tandem with 2D to create dynamic action scenes that are refreshing to watch. The character designs translate pretty well in both action and quieter scenes to create animation that stresses good movement via weight in the characters' actions as well as some snappy and exaggerated movements with good timing.\n \nThe film centers around fire, and as such the effects animation can be crazy at times, especially in the hands of Yoh Yoshinari or Toshiyuki Sato. These sequences utilize some really strong frame modulation to make the flames feel alive, the ice feel powerful and impactful, and the smoke shifts meticulously in order to sell the power of the flames. It's quite an impressive showcase of strong animators having fun with the film's theatrics.\n\nWhile the highs of the film are notably very strong, it does have a few faults in its character animation: there aren't enough subtle movements to sell the dramatic moments as strongly as they should. This is more noticeable in the second half of the film, which focuses more on the stream of fight sequences.\n\nNonetheless, the film is still quite the sight to behold; it has some of the best uses of 3D animation this year and some of the best action sequences as well.",

The rain almost becomes a character in and of itself, due to the tactility and physicality making the animation very expressive. It often zooms in close enough to let us see individual droplets and their light refraction animation which makes clear the wobbly liquid movement. \n\nIn general, the movie has an extremely high level of polish and fidelity. It brandishes a non-stop barrage of character animation that skillfully balances more grounded movement and cartoonishly exaggerating it. This way it nails the characters' appeal and energy without being uncharacteristically silly and over the top. The characters have a great sense of volume and elasticity, aided by realistic secondary motion in the cloth and hair that plants its characters in their world seamlessly, both in the foreground and background.\n\nUnfortunately, while there were some exemplary individual cuts (namely the truck explosion, the climactic heart of the storm, and the motorbike chase) they were usually too short to feel like proper, exceptional standout moments. It was ultimately this slight lack of flair and spirit in comparison to *Kaijuu no Kodomo* and *Promare* that secured its third place spot.

Furthermore, getting these characters to move and maintain an illusion of life in scenes such as the ballroom dance is a feat unto itself, creating that all-important sense of weight and balance.\n\nHowever, in other aspects, the movie fails to impress. Unlike the rest of our entries, it doesn't have any “money shots” - no gripping action sequences, no breathtaking effects work, no abstract imagery. *Violet Evergarden Gaiden*'s focus on mundanity and realism as well as strict adherence to elaborate designs didn't give the animators a lot of freedom to wow the viewers with their craft and artistry, having to serve the visions of character designers and the art department instead. The movie is very solid, it doesn't have any jarringly mistimed moments or dips in individual drawings' quality, but it also doesn't have any pizzaz as far as animation is concerned.\n\n*Gaiden*'s character acting is divisive. It can appear stiff and reserved, making the cast seem a little artificial as a result, like robots trying to act out human emotions. Yet the subtle delicacy of gestures and facial expressions can also appear craftful and charming.

This skilled use of backgrounds and color are thanks to the efforts of art director Honda Kouhei and background art studio Kusanagi.\n\nHowever, among the other nominations it was not quite able to compete with the majority of the other shows within the category.

The animation pieces created by the main cast see this imagination fully realized through the vibrant backgrounds that feel realistically and charmingly simple in their rendering, but maintain Asakusa's imaginative design. These sequences look incredible and are a great expression of the attention to detail and imagination that goes into world design.\n\nThe series applies its imaginative nature even outside of these special sequences. The campus design features striking architecture, like the stacked stone school buildings connected with arches and bridges. Combined with the concrete canals flowing through the campus, it takes on an industrial and maze-like venetian quality. The detailed lighting and crisp texture design contrasts especially well with the more simple style used in the animation pieces. This makes it feel realistic and modern enough to make sense as a ‘real life' counterpart to Asakusa's more wild imagination, while still feeling unique and inspired.  *Eizouken*'s scenery cleverly uses its variety and creativity to support the  series' themes of  imagination and creation.

This retro approach creates the sense of a modern society that feels regressed in some ways, which suits the show's social commentary perfectly.\n\nSadly, when the show moves away from the city, the background art loses its sparkle. Most of the time, when events take place indoors like trains, they look underwhelming.

This contrast ties in well with the plot, showing the living conditions of the people in each world clearly. Hole's backgrounds, through the use of greys and subdued colors, portray a grimy, dangerous place. This grittiness reflects its residents and gives a sense of their squalor. Yet, Hole looks comparatively normal to both the sorcerer's world and other shows in this category, so *Dorohedoro* falls slightly behind the shows that feel more unique.\n\nIn contrast, the sorcerer's world is an ornate city depicting the higher standard of living. Much like the grittiness of Hole, this ostentation highlights the lives of its residents and the feeling of prosperity. While the sorcerer's world still uses the same colors as Hole to maintain consistency between the worlds, it lacks the constant layer of grime. The outdoor shots in the sorcerer's world are also the most impressive of the show. The locations are incredibly diverse, and they feature layers of beautifully detailed buildings stacked in almost every shot. While hardly a problem, the sorcerer's world lacks a unique art style unlike some of the other nominees, instead relying on locations and detail. This sets it slightly behind some of the competition. *Dorohedoro* lacks something truly new, but its beautiful details and interesting locations leaves it at a highly deserved third place.",

		  "writeup": "*Great Pretender*'s background art design oozes with the confidence of a master who is on top of his game. It gives many real attractions its own spin, honoring these locations, while displaying a playful sense of artistry.The main ingredients for its success lie in its bold juxtaposition of color and its unique use of geometric shapes for shading, creating a more vibrant and stylized universe. The way *Great Pretender* meshes “blocks of colors” together give its settings a lurid, rich appeal that is highly abstract but also strangely detailed. These gorgeous backgrounds are perfectly in tune with the show's shape designs and its jazzy soundtrack. The art style takes inspiration from great Brian Cook art works, with saturated colors that change according to  the seasons.This makes them not only a feast to the eyes, but also keeps those eyes glued to the screen.\n\nThere are, on the other hand, inconsistencies to this bold approach. Buildings and other objects can sometimes look flat and textureless. These issues become more apparent when these buildings stand next to the more textured and colorful greenery. The lack of texture appears to have a “rendering look” that makes them stand out in a bad way. In conclusion, while *Great Pretender*'s lows are apparent, its highest highs amongst the nominees results in a very respectable fourth place.",

This all works together to create a highly comprehensive approach to lighting. Clearly, much effort has been expended to fully show the dynamic range across light and shadow, and how the camera's position in a scene can change how this is perceived.\n\nThis meshes together well with the realistic approach *Sora no Aosa* takes with its environments. Very detailed texturing work gives surfaces depth and character, such as the subtle inconsistencies in brick layed walls and sidewalks from one brick to the next. Great care was taken in the later fall scenes, with distinct and individually drawn leaves that are scattered across the sidewalks. However, this verisimilitude is also what holds *Sora no Aosa* back, as it deprived its backgrounds from artistically unique stylizations. Hence, it simply can't quite match up to the stiff competition. Still, the incredible lighting work and attentive texturing ensures that *Sora no Aosa*'s art stands strong and earns it a solid third place.",

Its backgrounds truly breathe life into the depiction of a seaside town. This is thanks to the work of Studio 4°C under the supervision of Art Director Shinji Kimura, who brought to life the art of Daisuke Igarashi. Every scene is filled with detail, from something as simple as overgrown plants on a side street, to the view of a jetty filled with boats from end to end in the distance. There are even times where it breaks away to refreshing locations allowing for a completely different kind of scenery. For example, settings such as a bright cityscape from the ocean showcasing dozens of skyscrapers with windows lit and street lamps visible in the distance.\n\nOf course, one cannot talk about *Kaijuu no Kodomo*'s backgrounds without talking about the underwater scenes. The excellent use of color with large quantities of coral and aquatic life combined with bright sun rays bleeding through from above water makes for a warm and welcoming atmosphere, especially during Ruka's exploration of shallow water areas. These aquatic scenes are directly contrasted by ones set in deeper areas that feel much more empty and cold. All in all it more than earned its place as the top movie in the category and was considered one of the most beautiful in years.",

Unfortunately, it still carries over issues the parent series had with its background art, namely leaving them out of focus and poorly lighting night-time scenes.\n\nThat being said, *Gaiden* is certainly an improvement compared to the television series. The filtering and visual effects don't appear as frequently, thus, the background art isn't as obscured. Half of *Gaiden* takes place in an all-girls academy, while the other half in Leiden after a timeskip. Both halves contain different approaches to background art. While the first half opts for closed-in shots that blur the backgrounds, the second half contains wider, open shots that reveal how much Leiden has changed. \n\n*Gaiden*'s mix of historical European architecture and tropical fauna make for an interesting setting. However, the way *Gaiden* stylized these backgrounds feel conservative, and far too concerned with realism. Its color design during dimly lit scenes avoids use of pure blacks, opting instead for dark grays that make these moments appear muddy with little contrast.\n\n*Violet Evergarden Gaiden* does have some amazing highlights, notably when Isabella and Taylor are surrounded by vibrant flowers near the end.

The overall scenery is indeed great on the outside and every shot from the most standard conversation to the highs of the movie feels alive and in an environment that is a place where we can live.

There were many anime this year with strong character designs, and between a number of interesting options, the public and the jury were able to narrow it down to eight strong nominations. The big story on this list is the domination of sequels, owing to a number of strongly produced shows continuing to bring their A-game with each subsequent entry. But despite the large number of sequels, it was the new shows and originals that created the most impact. Highlighted by *Hakumei no Tsubasa*, the TV rankings featured striking designs such as *Great Pretender* and *Akudama Drive*, along with unique designs such as *Eizouken* and *Deca-Dence*.\n\nThe movie list somehow managed to be an even tougher decision. While KyoAni managed to impress with yet another strong effort, it had a tough time competing with the grounded yet perfectly stylized designs of *Her Blue Sky*, and the incredibly impressive way that Marza Animation Planet brought *Lupin* to 3D while still blending it seamlessly with 2D effects. Ultimately though, this was *Promare*'s award to lose, with Trigger's juggernaut film bringing great designs whose impact were felt throughout the community.",

By developing designs through strong silhouetting and color blocking, these characters become icons for their respective generation. This is a well-established approach that yields diverse casts in terms of archetypal theming and body types.\n\n\nThe color design from their hair to their costumes complement the overall aesthetic of the series. While their linecounts have been simplified for animation purposes, this does not compromise the expressiveness of their features. For example, Bea's petite frame is packed with rigid lines and conveys her energy and strength through color theory, allowing the viewer to believe she is tough enough to go toe-to-toe with Pokémon three times her size.\n\n\nAdditionally, each character follows a unique shape language that supports their characterization. In a setting as warm and inviting as the world of *Pokémon*, these character designs embody that concept. These are characters that one wants to see move and express themselves. Nessa's figure is befitting of a model and her striking color palette is very appealing. Whether experiencing disappointment or amazement, her expressions and mannerisms demonstrate just what charismatic design work can accomplish.\n*Hakumei no Tsubasa* did a stellar job at adapting the games' designs to the ideas that the anime project wanted to exemplify. Good design is not defined by complexity, but rather if it functions as an extension of the story. For this exceptional artistry, it is awarded first place in Character Design.\n",

The protagonist Natsume shines through due to her light color design on her clothing and hair, exuding positivity and cheeriness. Kaburagi, on the other hand, has darker tones (especially their hair) and looks more gruff, giving a more stern impression. The Gears also provide visual diversity with their various skin tones and other traits, marking them as distinct from the Tankers.\n\n\nThe robots are entirely separated from the design principles of the humanoid designs thanks to not being constrained with  limitations that affect humanoid figures. The distinctive line work and cartoonish style which accompanies these more varied shapes changes the tone of the show quite significantly, matching the carefree attitude of the robots. This greater freedom of shape design also opens the door to greater use of shapes to convey personality. This can be seen in the administrative bots being wall-like blocks with a protruding head, giving the appearance of a  hunched back, or the more mischievous robot having snake-like features and curves.\n\nThe final design group on display is the Gadoll, the monsters which inhabit the world of *Deca-Dence*. These designs don't work nearly as well as the other two types. They are often rendered in 3D, seldom feeling in place in a world filled with 2D characters. This gives them an alien air, but feeling quite out of place.\n\n\nThese three different design principles don't always blend well, but most of them stood out as strong enough to deserve recognition.

This is primarily due to the origin of servants. Ushiwakamaru's medieval samurai armor with some ecchi elements and Gilgamesh's early Mesopotamia attire are standout examples of Grand Order's variety.\n\n\n*Babylonia* also uses character design to show the personality and characteristics of a servant, adding an extra layer of enjoyment to the show. Ishtar, for example, is the god of heavens, war, and beauty. The usage of gold represents her status in the pantheon and overall wealth while the primary colour blue represents the sky and her association with the heavens. Her revealing clothes show her authority over \"beauty\" and, lastly, her accessories are direct references to Ishtar's legend itself.\n\n\nUnfortunately, *Babylonia*'s character design fails on some fundamental aspects. Due to being a gacha game, original concepts of servant designs come from different artists. Trying to mesh each design into a common ground leaves a lot to be desired and makes animation more difficult than necessary. Reuse of facial structures damages the unique aspect of servants, Ishtar and Ereshkigal being the worst offenders. Lastly, poor implementation of the CGI makes their designs feel artificial and breaks viewers' immersion at key moments.\n\n\nOverall, *Babylonia* manages to keep all of its characters unique thanks to its attention to detail and multi-layered designs. This detail, however, is lost in monsters designs and CGI characters. For these reasons, it takes sixth place in the list.",

With designs radiating personality and optimized for movement, *Eizouken*'s characters are perfect for the show.\n\n\nThe main trio's designs say a lot with their iconic silhouettes and shape work. Kanamori's tall, foreboding frame grants her a sense of authority, while Asakusa's short stature builds on her hyperactive nature. The designs are acutely aware of shape theory: Kanamori's blocky squares communicate her stiff no-nonsense attitude, Asakusa's round shapes suggest her lack of focus and confidence issues, and Mizusaki's sharp angles convey her dedication and commitment. \n\n\nAdditionally, the designs are ideal for animation. Recognizable outlines and a focus on clarity allows the show's delightful animation to be possible. While simple, the characters never overlap in appeal. The main trio are the standouts, but everyone is visually distinct. Although most of the cast wear the same school uniform, they are distinguishable by their unique body shape and diverse skin color. The uniform itself is also appealing, with a color palette that draws attention to the characters, but contains subtle details that aren't flashy enough to take the focus away from the faces. \n\n\nOnly incredibly stiff competition kept *Eizouken* from first in the category. With simplicity allowing for energetic animation and shape work giving insight into the character's personalities, the designs in *Eizouken ni wa Te wo Dasu na!* complement the show perfectly. ",

Chika's design in particular encourages animators to be more flexible as a result of her exuberant personality, while many of Kaguya's hilarious reactions are made possible because of her sharp features.\n\n\n\nIt is very difficult for high school anime to succeed in this category as a consequence of their uniforms leaving the cast looking very similar from the neck down. This is not to say it's impossible for uniformed characters to find success in this category, as seen from previous winners.

At first glance, one might think they are not representing their sin; however, this approach makes one want to solve the connection between their sins. When one looks at the Witch of Lust, she has a very tame design with no revealing clothing. This might seem odd for someone with that title at first. However, she is not representing sexual lust, but rather the desires of humans.\n\n\nConnections and different interpretations such as these make the show more interesting. Unfortunately, this level of detail is not very common in this season of *Re:Zero*. We can see the intention of making them unique, but the reuse of facial structure on females makes one question this. On top of this, busy coloring creates a jarring experience because of tonal differences, the Witch of Sloth being the worst offender.\n\nIn conclusion, this season of *Re:Zero* had interesting ideas to expand its character design but there are many missteps.

Take Brawler, a muscular man with a loud fighting spirit, or Hacker, who wears a cybernetic eyepatch and uses drones when he hacks. Each design specifically revolves around a character's most important skill, reflected even in the characters' names. \n\n\nThe color choice of the character designs fit each character's personality and also complement the show's aesthetic. The dark and muted colors of some Akudamas' clothing contrasts the neon colors implemented to reflect the cyberpunk dystopian setting. The use of thick outlines is indicative of Komatsuzaki's art style and helps the characters stand out in front of the unique environments in the world.\n\nWhile *Akudama Drive*'s character designs do an excellent job in conveying each character's personality and role in the story, the designs ultimately do not stand out among other nominees. Specifically, Swindler and Courier's plain design falters in comparison to the more eccentric designs of the other Akudama.

The character designer Masayoshi Tanaka is far from a newcomer in this area, sporting an amazing track record designing characters. The cast is expressive in both their design and movement to effectively convey the emotions of the characters throughout the story.\n\n\nCharacters possess attributes in their design that fit well together with their personality, like Aoi's eyebrows demonstrating her angst and Shinno's wide-eyed arrogance. These designs change over time, reflecting the film's theme of growing up. For example, some characters' distinct facial features evolve as they grow older; this symbolizes both growth and how a person changes over time. In addition, the younger versions of the cast are colored more vibrantly, which becomes muted years later. All the while, the similarities between sisters Aoi and Akane and also Shinno and older Shinnosuke are subtle but unmistakable. \n\n\nEven though the cast has all of these interesting concepts, the design feels somewhat underwhelming. Regardless, the designs did not try any risks that may make the character seem more original, which unfortunately hurts among strong competition. It is not a bad thing to use the same design manual when creating amazing designs, but some variation would help captivate and engage viewers even more.\n\n\nAt the end of the day, what's more important is each character's style expresses their unique personal qualities. So despite the few hiccups, distinct and meaningful designs that fit the movies cast and theming well ultimately land *Sora no Aosa* in a solid third place.\n",

The transition of the traditionally 2D designs to 3D was expertly done; the characters are as expressive and lively as ever and this 3D spin still maintains each of their personal design quirks, with slight modifications to fit their movie personalities.\n\n\nThe returning cast has always been very expressive and distinct in terms of silhouettes, and this film is no different. Lupin sports an ear-to-ear grin  in this iteration, perfect for his more mischievous intentions in this film and for brazenly taunting his enemies. Fujiko's design leans into her playful side since a general audience may be less familiar with her more mature iterations. And Jigen's design, usually disgruntled and with his face always covered, comes across as extremely youthful, the long understated suaveness of his character pushed to the forefront.\n\n\nThe new additions were enjoyable as well. Laetitia stood out as lovable and conveyed her good- natured attitude. She is rather simple and not as distinct or memorable as the pre-existing *Lupin* designs, but still fitting for the heroine accompanying Lupin. The villains unfortunately embodied typical design tropes, with characters like hunchbacked old scientists with gold teeth, or intimidating scars being rather common when designing a villain character.  \n\n\nThe exceptional execution of this 2D to 3D conversion cannot be understated in this film, and maintaining the spirit and energy of the franchise in the new medium earned *Lupin* its nomination and second place finish.",

Shigeto Koyama designed these characters to look badass when posing and fun to crash into each other. As a project celebrating Trigger's brand of animation, the characters are a large assortment of their previous design tropes. Viewers may recognize that Galo bears a striking resemblance to Kamina (*Gurren Lagann*), Remi to Inumata (*Kill la Kill*), or Lucia to Spring (Trigger mascot). It's impossible to look at them and not know who made them.This works to the film's advantage, however, as these are designs that suit their style of dynamism and expression.\n\n\nA great deal of emphasis is placed on animation versatility and being super stylish. The reduction or outright removal of outlines from the characters facilitates the film's hybrid animation methods and its attractive cel-shaded look. They remain recognizable and appealing when contorted, squashed together against the camera, and even with less detail from a distance. Like all the other elements of the film, the designs were made to be visually flamboyant and have extravagant color schemes to match. The toy-like mecha designs are chunky, imposing, and allow the 3D animators to get in on the fun. Smaller characters like Lio Fotia and the Mad Burnish are sharp and slick with their black leather and bikes, while larger characters like Varys, Ignis, and Kray are blocky to match the geometric aesthetic of the film. \n\n\nAlthough *Promare*'s character designs are self-indulgent, they are undeniably eye-catching. So it's no surprise a design philosophy imbued with such showmanship would take first in Character Design for movies. Who doesn't love a shirtless fireman?",

The film maintains the consistency of the smooth animation and dazzling artstyle of the TV series, while elevating important scenes using solid linework and vibrant colors. *Violet Evergarden Gaiden* never fails to enrapture viewers and evoke strong emotions. \n\n\nThe returning characters from CH Postal Service have minor alterations that reflect on their journey and the changes they've undergone. Iris now dons a hairband and Erica sports braids, both with longer hair to display the passage of time. And Violet herself appears to have more worn-out expressions and exudes a sense of maturity. \n\n\nHowever, the main focus is on the two new entries to the series, Isabella and Taylor. Despite having simple designs, the sheer dedication to perfection and detail amplified their character quirks. The contrast between Isabella and Taylor is obvious. Isabella belongs to a prestigious family, attends the academy for debutantes, and wears dresses fit for aristocratic individuals. Whereas, Taylor is an orphan in a poverty-ridden town and has a worn-out shirt and ragged overalls for the majority of the film. These contrasts express the different ranks in society in which these characters live. While these new characters may lack impact to trigger our visual senses, they provide viewers sufficient context and grant adequate justification for their character designs. \n\n\nBeing nominated for Best Movie Character Designs is an incredible feat for *Violet Evergarden Gaiden* and is much deserved. Despite being pushed down to fourth, it was a strong contender nonetheless.",

The jury considered various aspects related to this role such as background integration, lighting, and filters. While not in the category title, the jury was also responsible for judging color design, a separate but related process that also has an industry role associated with it.\n\nThere was a wide variety of different reasons for the various nominations in the category: the highly stylised *Great Pretender* and *Hanako-kun*; *Enen no Shouboutai* with its myriad representations of fire; the polished *Hakumei no Tsubasa* and *Princess Connect! Re:Dive*; *Akudama Drive* with its neon cyberpunk aesthetic; the more conventional look of *Re:Zero Season 2*; and *Eizouken ni wa Te wo Dasu na!* with its expressive imagination sequences.\n\nAnd on the movie side there's the almost photorealistic nature of *Tenki no Ko*, with its beautiful lighting and water effects and *Violet Evergarden Gaiden*, with its impressive attention to detail. Then the much more stylised *Kaijuu no Kodomo* with its incredible representation of the sea, and *Promare* with its voxel aesthetic and expressive color palette.\n\nWhile Compositing is a lesser-known aspect of anime production, hopefully its inclusion here will get more people thinking about it and help them appreciate the impact it has on making the best looking shows of the year.",

From the first ending sequence that highlights the upcoming stories with a variety of lighting methods to the grand finale's awe-inspiring colorwork that elevates the expressiveness of the animation, each episode leverages the composite to maximize the impact of its emotional moments. The world feels fully realized as every new location expands the scope of compositing techniques. The effect of sunlight filtering through the dust as Bea and her Pokémon exit the cave or the beautiful rendering of underwater light refractions in Nessa's dive illustrate the grand scale of the Galar region. Shadows, reflections, and effects receive excellent attention to detail, whereas the effective 3d integration and depth of field provide a solid foundation for the series' animation. Vibrant color design is amplified with naturalistic lighting to appeal to the audience's sense of childhood romanticism. The harmony of these elements breathes life into every scene and produces a greater sense of dimensionality in the environments.\n*Hakumei no Tsubasa* possesses a visual cohesion that is without rival in the long history of this massive franchise. Director Shingo Yamashita and Studio Colorido have produced a work that is truly special. It is a testament to what an anime can achieve with a clear vision for its compositing. And for that, it deserves to be the first-ever victor of this category.",

Rather than going for one consistent look it tries to enchant specific moments or create a particular mood. For this it has quite a variety of tools at its disposal, ranging from bloom and depth of field to distinct textures and effects. From cold blue mornings and the lifeless gray of distant flashbacks to warm orange sunsets and lively, bright summer days, *Priconne* constantly juggles different color palettes while maintaining a polished look. Its meticulous usage of gradients for closeups and an enchanting line art effect—that looks like a thin shiny thread around characters—results in truly magical imagery, turning an otherwise standard fantasy setting into something unique.\n\n*Priconne* uses a wide variety digital effects, at times going overboard with their usage. Luckily this only happens occasionally, and the show consistently outperforms its peers. Beyond that, aside from a few missteps with background integration and some questionable usage of CG smoke for shadow monsters, *Princess Connect! Re:Dive* is a shining example of a modern approach to postprocessing in anime, and its strength net it third place in the category.",

Its deft use of color throughout the show is only enhanced by how thoroughly it understands lighting, and how that in turn affects coloration. This keen eye for detail carries the show, and carries it hard. The show not only understands how light affects coloration, but how it affects the human eye. *Hanako* is the rare sort of show that manages to achieve a form of storytelling through compositing, even if it's on a micro level. There are shots that are clearly first person - despite the camera angle or framing doing nothing to imply so - simply based on how the camera is exposed to sudden light sources and intensities. It puts you in the shoes of the characters, draws you in, and keeps you captive. \n\n*Hanako*'s camera effects are also exemplary when they want to be. Make no mistake, this isn't a Naoko Yamada production, but when depth of field blur *is* used, it is dialed in to precisely match how far out of focus various objects are.\n\nWith all this said, there are a few very minor complaints. Occasionally, dust and smoke effects don't quite mesh with the rest of the visuals, and while the show has incredibly high highs, it also has some weaker moments in terms of lighting and colorwork. Nevertheless, the beauty of *Jibaku Shounen Hanako-kun* when it's at its best means a well deserved second place in this category.",

Vivid effects coloring is present throughout the entire series, yet what makes *Fire Force* remarkable is not just its simultaneous quality and quantity, but its versatility. The stellar team at Asahi Production and the various paint studios managed to adapt their technique to fit the idiosyncrasies and individuality of all the animators. \n\nJust like no two people animate flames in exactly the same way, the methods used to color the flames mirror that diversity. For example, Kazuhiro Miwa's [detailed effects and distinctive edges](https://www.sakugabooru.com/post/show/127568) are completely preserved, while Riki Matsurura's [near-legendary fire animation from Episode 22](https://www.sakugabooru.com/post/show/138324) showcases a distinct style of coloring that intentionally overemphasizes the small imperfections and artifacts. When Hinonori Tanaka [contributed a single cut to Episode 18](https://www.sakugabooru.com/post/show/136096), the staff colored these drawings in a different manner from the rest of the show, befitting the uniqueness of his effects animation.\n\nOutside of these action scenes, however, the composite is inconsistent. Characters will often be colored well and have excellent shadows cast by fire, but they don't always fit well into the complex, CG backgrounds. Additionally, the few non-background CG objects look particularly out of place, like the ever-present truck. A final fault is the usage of CG fire and smoke. These were often used to represent non-infernal fires and to understandably relieve the burden on the animators, but they were not integrated well, often looking like a layer plastered over the world rather than a part of it. While these were issues, the highs were fantastic enough to make up for the shortcomings, and the flames of *Enen no Shouboutai* reach as far as fourth place.",

With a style that reminds us of the creators behind every frame, *Eizouken* isn't afraid of a half-polished look, but instead embraces it. The consistently loose approach to its aesthetics turns challenges into chances, as clear ideas are put into use without necessitating compromises between vision and practicality.\n\nThis holds true in *Eizouken*'s anime-within-anime and imagination sequences,  which present the show's finest composite. The minimalistic look of the former highlights the animation and pleases the eye, while not giving the club's animation a too professional image; the latter takes the advantage of the way the cardboard box-like 3D-objects blend with the concept and puts the backgrounds in motion. The anime's real-life sequences aren't too shabby either: scenes through the series take place under different lighting and weather conditions, while bright screens in dark rooms create a fitting atmosphere as the characters work until on on final cuts.\n\nDespite the variety and versatility of *Eizouken*'s composite, it lacks in amplitude. Minimal compositing and modest colors choice are the show's typical approach, and while this is effective, its usage throughout means that the show is rarely truly impressive where compositing is concerned. Elements like the brightness of the day or the dimness of a room take a backseat to other visual elements, resulting in an atmosphere than can feel as flat as the shadeless characters. Still, *Eizouken*'s position as the sixth best nominee says more about the quality of top five than anything else, and it's strengths far outpace the efforts it's peers in 2020.",

It uses holographic images and tv screens, blocky transitions between scenes, аnd rim lighting on characters—which making them fit in to the environment—to create а vast, yet oppressive high-tech low-life cyberpunk setting. The show excels at making its action setpieces inseparable from their locations. For example, in the hotel confrontation in Episode 2 characters interact with surrounding screens, and indoor lighting changes to reflect the state of the fight. Another case would be Episode 6, where the Brawler vs. Master showdown in the rain has individual droplets reflecting light in the midst of slow-motion imagery.\n\nUnfortunately, the show does not utilize its assets to its full potential. The show has a dark color palette with an emphasis on different shades of blue and red, and the show sometimes forgets about atmospheric lighting and coloring altogether and presents bright or dark rooms with just a single tone, and no depth. The usage of filters and effects are uneven as well, and *Akudama* also has a problem with CG integration, especially when Courier's bike is involved, which not only disregards laws of physics in-universe, but also lacks any sense of weight and cohesion with the background layers it interacts with.\n\n*Akudama Drive* ends up seventh place in the rankings because of this lack of consistency, but it is still one of the most ambitious projects of the year in its approach to composite, and presents some of the biggest visual highlights of this category.",

The bold colors, strong geometric shapes, and stepped shading make for a very unique style that is core to the show's identity. *Great Pretender*'s greatest strength is the application of its aesthetic to every level of production. At its best, it unites backgrounds, character designs, lighting, color design, and effects all together into a single cohesive package.\n\nIronically, *Great Pretender*'s lofty goals mean half measures and inconsistent applications hurt the overall aesthetic more than in shows with more standard visuals and composite. Many 3D assets are integrated quite well—the planes in Singapore being a notable high point—but when cars and settings aren't given the same attention, they actively conflict with the backgrounds. In addition, scenes where characters are simply shaded or colored plainly cause a similar disconnect between the foreground and background. Simplicity in composite is never inherently a bad thing, but in a year of strong nominations, these modest scenes hold the show back.\n\nSmall stumbles aside, when *Great Pretender* commits, it really flaunts its style and color design. Each major arc has a slight but meaningful difference in color and lighting. Scenes are colored to match the setting and tone, tying the aesthetic and the narrative closer together. These colors are then reflected on the characters's angular designs as well, matching the background's geometry, and making for a very cohesive composite. *Great Pretender* demonstrates how well distinct and atypical aesthetics can come together with a little thoughtful compositing.",

Camera filters are either too harsh or too subdued for the scene. Depth of field barely exists, and when it is used, it's to such an extreme that everything out of focus becomes an unintelligible blur that is never clarified with a depth of field change.\n\nThe lighting is a miss entirely, and almost never affects character shading and coloration outside of lighting that's been specified in the storyboards. As a general rule, the coloration of clothing and faces never alter which results in none of the characters truly feeling like they are a part of the backgrounds or even a part of the world at large. \n\n*Re:Zero Season 2*'s compositing is by no means bad, but it suffers a death by 1000 cuts to land it eighth place overall in a highly competitive category.",

Its rich, idiosyncratic art direction is blended together with large quantities of CGI, using excellent texture and filter work. The movie often flips between the gritty real world and the visual abstractions of the sea and features water effects that are even more impressive than *Tenki no Ko*. The textural feeling from the rough lines in the character art and the fauna allows the movie to maintain a visual consistency. \nAs the movie progresses, that grounded effect transitions to something more ethereal. There is an intentional degree of separation between the human world and nature. Rather than taking a realistic approach, the lighting and color design create a flat sensation to emphasize the linework. This claustrophobic feeling created by the information density generates a greater sense of scale as scenes shift to gorgeous wide shots of the sky and the sea. These are the visual climaxes throughout the movie, where colors dramatically shift to capture the movie's many unique atmospheres. Careful adjustment of the levels and hues allows everything to feel cohesive. Various camera techniques are used to produce the sensation of your eyes physically adjusting to the changes. The combination of these digital and hand drawn elements draws the viewer into the experience and culminates in an unbelievably stunning finale.\n*Kaijuu no Kodomo* is an absolutely mesmerizing experience.

To start, the movie is smarter with its depth of field and sets aside unnatural filters in exchange for more homogeneous ambient lighting.\n\nBe they candlelight or tall windows, the light sources throughout the movie are mostly natural. This lighting effortlessly conveys the time of day, and scenes are still innately colored to reflect the current mood. But what prevails throughout are warm colors that support the growing relationships between Violet, Taylor, and Isabella. The characters and scenery are carefully and intricately shaded to apply this wonderful palette to a detailed world. Lighting through hair, cloth, glass, and tree leaves is appropriately colored, even in motion. This cohesion between foreground and background creates a realistic and well executed aesthetic that fits right in with *Violet Evergarden*'s 20th century setting.\n\nAll that said, *Gaiden*'s clean and accomplished composite only goes so far. The dedication to realism limits the movie's potential and occasionally actively hurts it. For instance, detail to the point of being too busy hurts readability, especially when realistic colors are chosen over ones that would help highlight the focus of the shot. And occasional jarring CG breaks the illusion entirely. Even so, *Violet Evergarden Gaiden*'s biggest strength is in the way it invites the viewer to care about a world that reminds them of their own, which is very important for the small-scale, personal stories that *Violet Evergarden* tells.",

This eye-catching shot is complemented by the match cut to Nessa slicing a roll cake in half, illustrating her frustrated emotions towards Chairman Rose wonderfully. The episode also makes use of reflection shots to further get into Nessa's psyche—fitting as she is a water-type user.\n\nUnfortunately, the competition this year was harsh. Though it is a nitpick, *Hakumei no Tsubasa*'s simplicity and short length work against it. The series is excellently boarded though, earning its spot at third place.",

		  "writeup": "*Mugen no Juunin: Immortal* is a shining example not of what storyboarding in animation could be, but what it once was and why it was that way. *Mugen no Juunin*'s heaviest stylistic influences come from the early and mid 2000's, a time period best known for more limited animation overall, heavier emphasis on shot composition, and using storyboarding to keep scenes with little to no action interesting and engaging. This style came about for much the same reason *Mugen no Juunin* uses it: to prevent catastrophe. As the industry changed to begin incorporating new digipaint techniques, production schedules were thrown completely off on the animation side of things. To keep things visually interesting while easing the load for animators, anime storyboarding took on a distinct style of framing and cutting that packed detail into near static shots and let shows exist at all. This is *Mugen no Juunin* in a nutshell. A botched production cycle that only survived to the end due to it's boarding.\n\n\nOn a technical level, *Mugen no Juunin* excels on multiple levels. From smart usage of negative space, to shot compositions that feel simultaneously staged and organic, to really smart editing choices that demonstrate a mastery of tension and release, this show has it all. *Mugen no Juunin* also has a penchant for putting you in the shoes of its cast, whether that be from cleverly hidden POV shots, or from using a divorce between scene and visuals to show you what characters are thinking without any monologuing. All these elements combine to award *Mugen no Juunin: Immortal* first in storyboarding for 2020.",

Using mysteries as its central theme, Shaft is able to create atmospheric eeriness and unique shot compositions that grab its viewers' attention. Unfortunately, the issue of narrative weight, or rather the lack thereof, negatively impacts its storyboarding.\n\nOne of the most notable highlights is the sense of scale and the manipulation of perceived visual space. In several scenes, we are shown absurdly large rooms and hallways, introducing a mysterious and otherworldly factor to the whole series. There is a feeling of physical impossibility in the way the scenery can be  immensely vast, and yet it's treated as if it's normal. This disconcerting feeling permeates the show, while clever framing, such as isolating, obscuring, or separating characters, plays into the theme of loneliness throughout the show.\n\nThe major downside is the lack of narrative significance to the storyboarding. That is, while the show itself visually intriguing and pretty to look at, the boarding does little to further the show's plot beyond establishing the tone. Eye-catching storyboarding technique notwithstanding, a lack of clear meaning begs the question: is it style over substance? Even if it is, *Magia Record* radiates style, which nets it a much-deserved place among the nominees.",

Its execution of principles that were successful in its first season, such as wide shots, focused zooms, and camera transitions was incorporated into this season and mixed in with a variety of new, meaningful compositions. One of the strongest aspects this time around is its focus on exploring the inner machinations of its characters via environmental storytelling. Dynamic battles remain a strong suit of the show, and it's no accident that it's found a great way to create a sense of flow through its shot composition and editing.\n\nEven outside the action, *Enen no Shouboutai* frequently uses its layouts to create varied and complex atmospheres; these elevate tension and allow for good continuous framing. Sometimes environmental reflections or the use of a character's eyes help to display inner turmoil in subtle yet pleasant manners, such as Viktor contemplating his role and the dangers of being a spy or Sister Iris ruminating on devotion to the Church and its principles.\n\nThere are a few issues during downtime where there's not many interesting camera movements, and scene layouts lacking some of the aforementioned strengths and creative compositions that appear in battles. At times, held shots also last too long during expository dialogue, which makes the pacing feel uneven.\n\nNonetheless, *Enen no Shouboutai: Ni no Shou* is a visual spectacle in more ways than one, and its approaches to storyboarding create a stylized harmony of action and character dynamics.",

The show has some excellent character designs, but in the first episode it goes further by giving each of the main characters a similarly bombastic and video-gamey introduction, highlighted by striking framing and beautiful comic-strip cutaways. \n\nBeing almost entirely character driven, it is clear that a great deal of care was given to introduce and establish the personality of its ensemble cast. There is a wide shot for the hot-headed and violent “Brawler”, frenetic cuts for the fast-paced “Hacker”, and uncomfortable extreme-angle views for the enigmatic “Courier”. The fight boarding is also quite impactful; beyond being smooth and easy to follow, the show also portrays each character's fighting style in a distinct way.\n\nThe biggest shortcoming of *Akudama Drive* is that outside of the good fight boarding and a handful of exceptional episodes, it doesn't *consistently* stand out. The first and last episode are genuinely excellent, but all of the higher ranked shows are exceptional more consistently. The fights are consistently good, but *Enen no Shouboutai* set an even higher bar. The visual symbolism is thoughtful, but *Muugen no Juunin: Immortal* has it beat tenfold. None of this is to say that Akudama Drive is mediocre; from the very first episode the show's strong sense of style, good fight choreography and thoughtful visual symbolism make it an engaging experience.",

Particularly in Season 2, the staff are more adventurous with the visual humor, animating things in different styles or changing the aspect ratios for dramatic emphasis.\n\nThe show often plays around with things like aspect ratios and bizarre framing for comedic effect. Scenes like the balloon game in the finale feel very dynamic and character-appropriate, mirroring their (comically exaggerated) anxiety without feeling jarring. While the most common usage is comedic, there are moments of more dramatic emphasis. In Yuu Ishigami's episode, the boarding reflects his feelings of isolation and anxiety with close up shots that frame the other students as distant or show the palpable discomfort on his face when his previous school is mentioned. \n\nThe big issue holding *Kaguya* back is that a lot of its scenes are pretty basic slapstick comedy boarding that you would find in many slice-of-life comedies. Things like exaggerated expressions or the use of speedlines for comedic emphasis are very commonly used. It is functional but it makes the show weaker when compared to nominees that are more consistently inventive and engaging.

The tea party scenes in particular are when the boarding of the show is at its best, showcasing the dynamic between Echidna and Subaru and the flow of their conversations. The most striking example is the beautiful top-down rotation shot at the start of Episode 9. And Episode 4's boarding helps intensify an emotional episode, sometimes obscuring Subaru's face and sometimes doing the opposite. The extreme eye closeups are particularly effective here and are also used throughout the show to really hammer home the emotions of the characters.\n\nOutside of this though, the show's boarding is incredibly standard. The shot selection, composition, and editing during normal conversation scenes, which is most of the show, is uninspired. The action sequences don't have any flair, which makes them less interesting. Because of this it would not be a stretch to call much of the storyboarding boring.\n\nIn the end, *Re:Zero*'s boarding is relatively clean, and it does have occasional moments of brilliance, but these are few and far between, and the show finishes behind other entries that push the boundary further.",

The main character, Ruka, has two sides, one that wants to communicate and another that wants to retain her individuality. This internal conflict is illustrated via the motif of the sky and the sea, mirror shots, and scenes that isolate Ruka from her surroundings.\n\nThis isolation is best depicted at the start of the movie. After her metaphorical fall from the sky, Ruka is shown behind the netting of her school's goalie net, indicating how caged she now feels. Later, she is depicted outside the blades of an indoor fan. The air of the fan stops blowing on her, further illustrating her descent from the sky, but also separation from those around her. \n\nLike the story of *Icarus*, Ruka descends towards the sea. The tracking shot used as she runs away from school is called back at the end of the movie. The tilt shot used in this final epiphany is absolutely goosebump-inducing. The tilt upwards happens so quickly, it manages to perfectly meld the sea and sky together, referencing the balance Ruka obtains within herself.\n\nThe boarding addresses its motifs even through its aspect ratio. The usage of widescreen lends a theatrical feel but also emphasizes width, pairing well with the horizontality of the sea. During moments with vertical orientation, the negative space helps draw the viewer's attention and similarly represents the verticality of the sky.\n\nDirector Ayumu Watanabe's boarding highlights and clarifies *Kaijuu no Kodomo*'s story, thus earning its first place victory.",

The camera moves energetically during action scenes, there are few cuts, and sometimes continuous action is shown for as long as two minutes, which is rare for anime. The movie also uses shots that zoom in on characters quickly, adding to the movement of the camera and benefitting comedic moments as well as character introduction scenes.\n\nIt isn't just the action scenes that are impressive, however. Director Hiroyuki Imaishi uses familiar techniques like symmetry and parallax to create depth. This is most notable in one of the slower moments in the movie, when Galo and Aina are ice skating together. The trees are reflected onto the ice of the lake, creating a symmetrical layout while the slow panning and parallax produces a romantic atmosphere. The panning picks up, turning into a full on rotation shot around Galo and Aina. In a typical romance, this would symbolize how the two are the center of each other's world, but Imaishi knows how to pull out the rug from under the viewer and Aina both, throwing her and the camera upside-down and comedically concluding the scene.\n\nUnfortunately, sometimes the movie can go overboard with its dynamic shots as it overflows with rotations and zooms. Moments like the ice skating sequence are rare; the movie as a whole is lacking in similarly slow paced scenes. Overall though, *Promare*'s storyboard is adept at using dynamic flow to keep the viewer engaged and thus earns its second place spot.",

The movie follows two characters in two different settings: in the first half, an out-of-place girl who feels trapped in an academy for the elite, and in the second half, an orphan enjoying the wide open space of the city. These emotions are illustrated via the two different storyboarding decisions in each half.\n\nThroughout the first half of the movie, Haruka Fujita's storyboards make use of close-ups to focus on certain body mannerisms in the legs or hands as opposed to the face, emphasizing the importance of the smallest touches and drawing out the viewer's emotions. A notable highlight is the movie's ability, through framing alone, to convey feelings of insecurity and the desire to be left alone by isolating characters into tiny sections of the screen—fitting, considering the cramped setting of the academy.\n\nIn the second half of the movie, *Gaiden* eschews its closed and intimate storyboarding in favour of wide shots to show the freedom of the city. Though the change in style makes sense for the new setting and narrative, the resulting storyboards feel less inspired and therefore less unique. Additionally, with the exception of the dance sequence, the movie suffers from a lack of dynamic camera movement.\n\nUltimately, creative storyboards tend to stand out and are more memorable compared to their more conventional counterparts. Though its lack of ambition prevents *Gaiden* from placing higher in the rankings, the movie still excels at what it does: conveying the emotions felt in each location through different storyboarding techniques.",

It makes good use of the rule of thirds and depth of layers in the frame to consistently make aesthetically appealing shots, although it's a bit over-reliant on those techniques. Unfortunately, past that, it's seldom uniquely shot, instead contenting itself with an abundance of straightforward medium shots and and a lack of camera motion. The result is that the movie's boarding rarely enhances the narrative in any meaningful thematic or attention-grabbing way. That being said, the editing in the movie is quite great. It has a stellar sense of tempo, especially in the more fast-paced montage sequences, since few shots ever feel like they linger or rush. The comedic timing and boarding is also quite good, for instance when Natsumi interrogates Hodoka and when Hodoka is called out in the park.\n\nNotably often, *Tenki no Ko*'s storyboarding relies on zooming out to wide shots as a stylistic crutch to showcase the setting and backgrounds. On one hand, these setting-building shots are great for atmospheric purposes, and putting one of Shinkai's strengths at the forefront is a good choice. On the other hand, like the rest of the movie's boarding techniques, they're a tad overused and don't further the movie much narratively, if at all. \n\n*Tenki no Ko*'s shortcomings in terms of ambition and thematic intent caused it to fall behind the other contenders, but the movie's strengths are such that the boarding doesn't need to be flashy to to make for an excellent experience.",

Moreover, there were more than a few, such as *Dorohedoro* and *Made in Abyss*'s third movie, that accomplished the general essence of soundtracks: elevating already great series to even greater heights.\n\nJudging OSTs is a three-part endeavor, the first two of which are fairly straight-forward - taking into account not only how a track sounds in isolation, but also the context in which the music is used. The first covers everything, from compositional techniques, to instrumentation, to mixing, and even to musical genre. The second covers not just during what scenes any given piece plays, but also how well it's mixed in with any other audio. Is it “covering” up dialogue in a scene? Or is itself barely audible and being diluted by sound effects or dialogue? These aren't necessarily downsides, as there could be thematic reasons as to why this is happening, but they are considered.\n\nThere is one more aspect to be considered when judging an OST, and it sits squarely between the extremes of musical isolation and context. That aspect is what themes and [leitmotifs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVlsIhbQ2qM) the OST has, how it uses them, and how it develops them over the course of the show or movie.

The instruments used are all in some way thematically tied to the setting, falling into one of two categories. Most of the melodies are carried by woodwinds and other light instruments that are classically tied with winds, which is rather fitting for a show focusing on an airship. The other types of instruments are those that might be found on said airship: pipes, guitars, and some unusual percussion that sounds closer to banging on a ship's hull than a drum.

Important moments are accompanied by orchestral swells that proclaim the series' main motifs. These themes are embedded in a large number of songs, and that variety makes it feel like each restatement is unique to that specific scene. \n \t\nThis, unfortunately, did not alleviate a notable issue with the soundtrack; the main themes, while good, are overused a bit.

By mixing the atmosphere of the current scene seamlessly, *Appare-Ranman!*'s OST adds another layer of enjoyment to the show thanks to the immersion it brings.\n\nThis is largely achieved by using a wide range of instruments. Middle-age Japanese tunes, European classics, and wild-west themes are merely samples for the aforementioned variety. For example, the track ‘Murica' immediately makes the viewer think about the U.S. even without looking at the title of the track, for the country's national anthem is arranged in a typical bluegrass style that is commonly associated with America. All these connections enhance the experience for standalone listening as well.\n\nWhile simplicity is nice, some of *Appare-Ranman!*'s tracks feel oversimplified with little to no undertones behind it. Action packed tracks such as ‘Gloves OFF' are enough to fill the scenes they are playing but it falls flat when compared to other versatile tracks. On top of this, reuse of tracks dampens their effects as the show progresses. At worst, some tracks like ‘Are You Ready' lose their unique nature due to their repeated usage. \n\nOverall, *Appare-Ranman!* offers a variety of themes and tunes.

The usage of these specific tracks encapsulates the aforementioned ability of the soundtrack to augment the absurdity of the world. ‘Upset Small Tits' is played while Ebisu prances around a baseball game as the singing shark ~~saboteur~~ mascot, and in contrast to this we have 'Damn It,' the blood-pumping heavy metal track which is used in an epic fight scene to juxtapose the absurdity of Noi cheerfully asking to befriend Nikaido while also trying to kill her.\n\nThese examples are but a fraction of what the soundtrack can boast, and it fully personifies the insanity and grotesque mysticism of *Dorohedoro*'s outlandish world, and the unique and fitting nature of the magnificent music on display earns its soundtrack the top spot.\n\nTo read the OST jury's in-depth discussion about the Dorohedoro OST, you can check out [this thread](https://redd.it/k6owzh).",

In the OST department, the first season didn't manage to make an impact, but this season changes that thanks to some improvements it brings.\nThis time, the composition of tracks revolves around the jokes they play in. The notes and pitch reflect this and manage to enhance the scene. “Watashi Dake,” for example, manages to convey the emotion in the scene while keeping up with the tone of the show. However, this magic breaks quite quickly due to the reuse of tracks in unrelated scenes. Many tracks don't work well as a result and rather than supporting the show, it lowers the overall enjoyment.\nThis effect can also be observed in the standalone listening experience. Tracks don't mean much without context, like “Shizen'na nagare.” One can't understand the feelings and goals of this track, and the execrated nature of it creates a jarring listening experience.\nIn the end, *Kaguya-sama* manages to take one step forward with its tracks while also taking one or two steps back. It sacrifices overall cohesion to improve the delivery of jokes with tracks and timing. Unfortunately, that only works in a few scenes, and the issue of reusing tracks further diminishes the effectiveness of the show's OST. Ultimately, *Kaguya-sama* notches below many other nominees and comes in at seventh place.",

Yutaka Yamada, the composer, incorporates elements of electronic and hip-hop styles to bring a modern twist to the tried-and-true crime-thriller soundtrack formula.Tracks such as the theme “Great Pretender” are slick and stylish, which are befitting as themes representing the silver-tongued conmen in the anime. Moreover, the tracks form a cohesive OST that is pleasant to listen to in isolation.\n\nThroughout the show, the soundtracks are also generally used competently. They match and enhance the scenes they are used in, such as during action scenes where tracks like “Goner” and “On the Clock” maintain the pace and bring more energy to elevate the action being portrayed on the screen. One particular scene in which a track is used effectively to convey the action is during the car chase scene in the first case.\n\nYamada's work in *Great Pretender* is not without its downsides, however. Perhaps owing to directorial decisions or simply a lack of appropriate tracks, there is a noticeable overuse of a few songs, such as “Great Pretender” and its unfitness in certain scenes. In addition, some tracks are less varied than others, diminishing their versatility and effectiveness. Nevertheless, *Great Pretender* comfortably lands in the middle with fourth place for its unique jazz-themed OST.",

Despite some gripes with the soundtrack, it is generally competent at what it sets out to do for a show like *Re:Zero.*.\n\nThe soundtrack maintains the eerie vibe that it is impressive at executing while still keeping each scene engaging - “Echidna” is a perfect example of a fantastic execution of this tried-and-true formula. The haunting vocal support amplifies the excitement and dreariness of the situation. To contrast this, there are tracks like “New Maid” and “Petra Leyte” that are more of an upbeat and less somber tone to distract the viewer from the true grim nature of the show. While highlighting these tracks, it is also interesting to note how the OST dedicates songs to certain characters to give a strong association with them. \n\nHowever, there are some gripes to be had with the soundtrack. The OST isn't particularly memorable nor does the instrumentation stand out compared to other soundtracks this year. *Re:Zero Season 2*'s OST is serviceable and has good usage, but it is not quite as strong as some of the other nominees due to its unvaried tracks, thus landing it in a respectable sixth place.\n",

Indeed, the only complaint that could be leveled against it on a technical level is that it sounds a bit too much like *Made in Abyss*' OST at points. \n\nSadly, show usage is this OST's downfall. Themes and leitmotifs that Penkin attempts to develop in the soundtrack for characters and thematic ideas are often used in scenes they do not appear to be intended for. Beyond that, there are times where the direction of the show actively gets in the way of the soundtrack functioning. For example, four minutes into episode 12 a fight starts, and the OST begins to build tension as the action ramps up, only for a ten second cut-away to be accompanied by an intentional musical change. The fight returns only to have a completely different piece play instead. This whiplash damages the portrayal of tension that was building throughout the length of the fight. \n\nNevertheless, Penkin's *Tower of God* OST still has its merits with its varied instrumentation and composition that is used competently in some scenes; it is just that its usage that unfortunately fails to impress, earning the show the eight best OST of 2020.",

Being jam-packed with new and interesting tracks during the two-hour runtime breathes fresh air into the *Precure* soundtrack that is more focused, diverse, and purposeful.\n\nEach track in this OST has a distinct purpose of driving the narrative forward, which makes the experience that much more fulfilling to experience. It establishes an emotional connection with the viewer right from the beginning. A great example of this is “The Shooting Star Song” that draws a strong emotional association with Yuma. Another example is “Lala is Upset'” or “Lala is in Pain” that exemplifies the association of the soundtrack as a whole to the characters that viewers may grow attached to over the long run-time of the show. These and other recurring motifs sell the OST, and they are used superbly throughout the movie fantastically. \n\nThe biggest strength is the variety of themes and songs used. The *Star Twinkle* movie can shift from a bubbly, futuristic pop-tune like “I'm Hungry ~Lun,” to a dark and emotionally fueled spiral such as “Lost Star,” or to a glitchy and epic orchestral tune like “The Hunter's Invasion.” These tracks vary considerably in soundscape, yet still fit each scene perfectly. Despite this, there are some criticisms with the OST leaning too heavily on the main show's soundtrack or overusing the main motif slightly too much. The top three options all have significant strong points, but with an extremely varied soundtrack and ambitious usage, *Star☆Twinkle Precure Movie*'s OST stands out among the rest in third place.",

Speaking of which, it is of no surprise that his collaboration once again with *Kill la Kill's* Hiroyuki Imaishi on *Promare* has produced one of the best and most magnificent movie soundtracks of the year. To start off, one can hardly discuss *Promare's* soundtrack without praise for ‘Inferno', the movie's main theme, which is not only superbly used to hype up the movie's opening but is also an excellent, energetic tune featuring lyrics that perfectly encapsulate Galo and his journey throughout the film.\n\nIt also must be stated that, akin to his iconic work on the soundtracks to *Kill la Kill* or *Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn*, *Promare* knows how to bring on the intensity before the contractually obligated and glorious Sawano Drop hits and we ride the wave to the music's triumphant conclusion, like in the track ‘PRO//MARE,' for example. That said, there is a bit of a flaw to all this—while excellent, there's really nothing that hasn't been heard before in Sawano's existing work; indeed, *Promare* may have borrowed a little bit *too* much from his past successes. All that aside, *Promare's* soundtrack is loud, in-your-face, and bold, with a brash and chaotic energy to it that perfectly encapsulated the spirit of the film.

In scoring for the series' third movie, Penkin once again presents the viewers with his clever instrumentations and subtle musical storytelling. Like the first season, the OST captures the childish whimsy of its main characters, the dreadful roaring of the Abyss, and the melancholy and pain expected of this series. However, the movie's soundtrack is not content in simply being a retake: It builds upon earlier themes and motifs while also introducing new ones and developing them in sublime ways.\n\nFor example, “Papa's Lullaby” and “Transcendance and Hanezeve” play during the introduction to the antagonist, Bondrewd, and his mid-point resurgence in the movie, respectively. While lesser composers may perhaps imbue these tracks with a villainous ring, Penkin infuses them with all the complexities that define a character such as Bondrewd, exemplifying his loving relationship with Prushka and his fanatical devotion to science. Furthermore, the blaring trumpets of “Dark Reg, Nightmare Fuel” proclaim the heroism of our robotic protagonist. Penkin ties all of these tracks together with leitmotifs built intimately into them, as seen in the climactic “The Rumbling of Scientific Triumph,” where the motifs associated with Bondrewd as well as the trumpets earlier associated with Reg merge brilliantly together as the two battle one another, each believing to be the hero of the story.\n\nWhat's even more astonishing is that the entire soundtrack is brimming with such standout tracks. And for that, *Made in Abyss* deservedly earns its spot as the top movie OST of 2020.",

RADWIMPS' youthful, airy vocals and the poppy, lively energy work quite well in the montage sequences, where they amplify the urban teen romance and adolescent optimism of its protagonists. However, the usage of themes and leitmotif from insert songs later in the movie are much more of a mixed bag. On one hand, the motifs from more optimistic songs are used decently well through the runtime. On the other hand, the scenes with the motif from “Is There Still Anything That Love Can Do?” build up an ominous feeling of helplessness, but have their foundation ruined by how abruptly and tactlessly the insert is used at the end. Additionally, the insert song “Grand Escape,” which is barely built up melodically or instrumentally, feels out of place in the climax of the movie. \n\nWhen it comes to the instrumental tracks of the movie, the usage of each track is generally quite fitting to the scenes and their flow due to the tracks being scored to scenes and not written in isolation. Despite that, the simplistic instrumentation and compositions play it safe and lead to a regular viewing experience. There's not really any specific or revolutionary sound that this soundtrack strives to achieve, but regardless, it blends in with the scenes in a way that amplifies the scene-to-scene relatively well.",

While the premise is simple, what makes GalDino special is that, thanks to Dino's inability to speak, he can only communicate through actions. This means every action has an emphatic sound attached to it, such as MLG airhorns and trademarked Lightsaber noises, which along with your standard *beeps* and *boops*, allow GalDino to express itself fully. \n\nThe use of sounds that are unrelated to dinosaurs is an adventurous choice. Despite this, they are all used in service of the bubbly and cartoonish aesthetic and vibe of the show. There is no excessive spam of MLG airhorns that you may find in other surreal ‘meme' shows and it even uses the expectations of these sounds as a subversive punchline. Each sound has meaning to it, such as expressing actions or emotions. Simple aspects such as walking, thinking, showing happiness, or even what can only be described as a “deflated lightsaber” to represent dejection. The possibilities are endless and the concept is implemented well enough to provide communication between Dino and the viewers.\n\nJust the pure adventurous and creative direction of the show and the heavy reliance on the sound design paid off well for *GalDino*. The vast amount of different sounds used in the show and the creative thought process behind them allows *GalDino* to take the top spot in the Sound Design category. Combined with fantastic comedy and a wholesome story, *GalDino* becomes a show that's a cut above the rest.\n",

Shows with equally adept writing would often get slammed when the majority of what you see is glorified character cards slowly traversing the screen, accompanied solely by character monologues.  So how is it that the presentation of the show is rarely criticized?  How does the show take a minimalistic visual presentation and still remain incredibly compelling to watch?\n\nIt's the soundscape.\n\nIt's almost storybook that a show that deals so much with sound is driven on a production level almost exclusively by sound.  This vibrant canvas of sounds serves to break up the vocal track while also bringing the still images to life.  It characterizes movements that look identical in direction and speed, and it perfectly establishes the impact of each moment.  The sounds of hands slapping tatami mats and karuta cards whistling through the air are custom-created for the series, and the attention to detail is easy to perceive.  The pang of Harada's knee flaring up takes what is just a picture of an old man and turns it into a gut-wrenching, visceral reaction that sets the stage for his character arc.  There is no other show this year that weaponizes silence as much as Chihayafuru, which is in stark contrast to its normally euphonious soundscape.  “Good sound design is sound design you don't notice” is a cliché that has been repeated ad nauseum in the anime community. But if you stop for a moment, close your eyes, and listen, it becomes easy to appreciate the brilliance of the design and direction of this third entry in the series.\n",

As indie anime creators, the main trio have to grapple with every part of the anime production process, and they find themselves in dire need of help with their sound design and mixing. When they seek out the help of the Audio Club, the lone member finds themselves so disturbed by their project's rudimentary sound design that she literally [pukes after listening to it...twice](https://streamable.com/2pyqe).\n\nEven when *Eizouken* isn't making specific allusions to the sound design of the in-anime projects, it constantly finds ways to be interesting. As we see much of the club's anime in its initial inspiration and planning phases, those imaginary sequences are accompanied by vocal sound design from the main characters. For example, Sairi Itou, who voiced Midori, was able to perfectly replicate the desired sounds for any given scene, while also getting across the playfulness and excitement of her character. Outside of vocalized sounds, the anime is typically authentic-sounding, even if the sound effects aren't totally unique, or if the overall sound profile can feel a bit sparse at times.\n\nEizouken also features scenes detailing how to manipulate soundtracks in order to better accentuate animation, and follows the main crew as they go “sound hunting” for unique effects when creating an anime based in their hometown. While sound design is often a relatively unheralded part of the process of creating anime, *Eizouken* devotes a significant amount of time and effort to detailing why it is absolutely essential to the success of any anime.\n",

The vast quantity of simple mouth-clicking noises and ripping of flesh acted as a stress-inducing element for the viewers and alluded to the violent nature of these rabbits, implanting a new and memorable element of fear into our hearts. Another example would be the specialised magical and physical powers each character possesses. Puck forming and firing ice, Elsa's unsheathing of her blades, and Roswaal's wind-oriented powers all have well-produced sounds for their respective specialities. \n\nWhile praise was given where it was deserved, *Re:Zero* was unable to provide a level of sound design that elevated the show to  outdo the other nominations on this list due to the expositional nature of the show.\n",

It gently lulls you into the sounds and images of Ruka's hometown, where you can feel the heat of Summer and hear the buzzing of cicadas, the call of birds, and lapping of ocean waves against fishing boats as she runs about. When Ruka arrives at the aquarium, the incredibly accurate portrayal of aquatic life in the form of dolphins chattering, fish flitting around their tanks, and yearning whale song becomes more prevalent. \n\nRuka is later plunged into the sea itself, along with her companions who guide her to understand that there is something larger trying to communicate with them through time and space. The motif of water is executed brilliantly through sounds of the ocean bubbling and gurgling around Ruka as she becomes immersed in it, while also accurately muting environmental sounds as they can't travel as easily through water. The tumultuous rainstorms that strike throughout the film feel frightening and the sounds of whales breaching and crashing into the ocean are appropriately bombastic. Ruka's companions, Sora and Umi, are also typically accompanied by water sounds, which depict them as being closer to creatures of the sea than normal human beings.\n\nThe climactic scenes of the film are a beautiful synchrony of sound and animation as Ruka's experiences become something of an acid trip where she becomes one with the universe, and is immersed in a soundscape that is fitting for such a journey. *Children of the Sea* excels at telling its story through sound, and accentuating the journeys of its characters with unique sound design choices, which envelop the audience throughout the film.\n",

		  "writeup": "In contrast to the other three nominees, the sound design team of Promare decided to apply as many sounds throughout the movie as they could. This abundance of sound and energy in the movie gives it a very frenetic energy, fitting for a movie on some level about ‘firefighting'. If you have ever seen Kill la Kill, Darling in the Franxx, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann or even Inferno Cop , you probably know what to expect from a Trigger movie and these expectations will neither be disappointed nor exceeded.\n\nDuring the initial confrontation between the main characters, for the most part the sound mixing is very high quality (during the transformation etc.), but there are also sounds that sound frankly goofy when the main character is transforming, topped off with a ridiculous siren straight out of a kids cartoon. The sound effects in the opening sequence of the film as chaotic flame-energy is raging through the populace is really effective. The movie uses this combination of more ‘realistic' mixing with straight ‘sound effects' to really reinforce the whole self-aware over the top machismo feel of the whole movie. \n\nUltimately, this movie could largely be summarized as “Produced by Trigger”. Living up to expectations, it is undeniably emblematic of the memorable bombastic and expressive style (and trappings) of a Trigger anime.\n",

Reaching the deeper stages of the Abyss comes with new environments and the movie was able to adapt and adjust the sound design to match them, mostly increasing the reverb to express the cave-like setting. One particular moment stands out above the rest and this scene was able to inject anxiety and fear into the hearts of the audience. The scene where Bondrewd is first introduced is a masterpiece of a scene. During the scene, Bondrewd's footsteps are echoed and any other sound is silenced. While some mention that the echoing is overdone, almost becoming comical, there's no denying that all the attention is placed on Bondrewd as his reveal occurs in slow-motion. The echo and silence expresses the protagonists' emotions as they finally meet the character they dread. Accompanied by the incredible visuals and cinematic direction, the sound design can't help but elevate the scene and the film as a whole.\n\nOverall, *Dawn of the Deep Soul* was able to elevate the film using sound design by staying consistent with old sounds such as Reg's metallic arms and laser fire, adding new sounds such as the drills on the operation table, Bondrewd's laser, and the addition of reverb and echo that help set the stage. Superb sound designing that deserves the number two spot.\n",

The sound of rain is used to great effect, and feels similar to the way the sound of live wires are used in Serial Experiments Lain.  In addition to the rain, other weather sounds also were done well and used to great effect in driving dramatic tension in the narrative.  Like many other Shinkai movies, everyday sound effects such as footsteps on stairs and the sounds of the city were so authentic and immersive that they were borderline cathartic.  A particular design that resonated with everyone in the jury was the gunshot, which was brought forward in the mix with great effect, and when paired with the post-shot ringing it really stole the show and drove the emotional narrative of the scene almost single-handedly.\n\nUnfortunately, the jury felt that most of what Weathering did good Children of the Sea did better.  With such similar approaches to the soundscapes, it was tough not to compare the two, and while Weathering was definitely worthy of being on this list, it did not fare well in comparison to Children.\n",

Japan has one of the best, most competitive voice acting industries in the world, and anyone who says otherwise is fooling themselves. In such an environment it is expected that only the best of the best survive, and that shows every single year.\n\nWith that in mind, the jury process was a harsh one. Selecting only a handful of performances in a sea of deserving choices was an already daunting task. Cutting down the list of nominees was also difficult, and a lot of great names didn't make the final cut.\n\nOnce the list was set, ranking was another complicated task. While one to nominees had few dissents in placement in the category, every other position was up to debate, and every name had at least one big supporter.\n\nRiho Sugiyama and Aoi Koga, for example, had top 3 placements in a few lists. Yet they were overshadowed by other names to some jury members. Along with Tomoyo Kurosawa and Mamoru Miyano, they were some of the most discussed names during this step in the process. In the end the final rankings reflect, of course, the most consistent opinions of the jurors, with Seki Tomokazu taking the crown for an excellent performance by consensus.",

Viewers know what he is capable of; his skills in shows such as *Death Note* and *Steins;Gate* are examples that come to mind. Then, is Taichi Mashima worthy of being cited as one of his best roles, or is it a role carried by Mamoru's name alone? The former comes closer to the truth. While not as flashy as other characters in the category (or in Miyano's portfolio), Taichi is still a reminder of why Miyano is regarded as one of the best in the industry. \n\nThe precision in tone for calmer moments, the calculating, sometimes frantic, nature of Taichi's thoughts during games, and of course the big emotional climax of the season -  all are delivered with grace by Miyano. The result is a performance with the right temperature, utilizing soft and harsh tones with ease, while keeping the technical aspects always at near perfection. A masterclass in voice acting, and a script that extracts the best the actor can offer: Taichi and Miyano are a great fit for each other.\n\nThat said, there are some criticisms that express how other performances are a touch above, citing a small decline in Miyano's voice acting in comparison to previous seasons. Despite that, Mamoru Miyano as Taichi Mashima is still an amazing display of voice acting and earns a respectable sixth place in a competitive year.",

Notable ones include the happy-go-lucky Bakarina, the dignified Judge Bakarina, the allegedly-smart Bakarina, the shrinking-violet Bakarina, and the reckless Bakarina, all with appropriately matching vocal registers to boot from Uchida. \n\nIn addition, Maaya Uchida's chemistry with the other cast members is excellent. It's hilarious to see the ever increasingly exasperated reactions of the sane cast members, to the antics of the loveable moron as she blunders about with her harebrained scheme, avoiding doom while seducing literally everyone with her charm, good will, and stupidity. Therefore, while not as dramatic as other voice actors, it's of no surprise that Maaya Uchida's show-stealing voice acting as Katarina lands in a well-deserved third place.",

The character goes through an evolution within the series, thus giving Tomoyo the opportunity to showcase her amazing range and intonation. In a way, Tomoyo is voicing two characters in this one role. As Ordinary Person, Tomoyo utilizes a higher-pitched, cutesier voice. She sounds clueless and innocent. As the story progresses, Ordinary Person slowly reveals their real identity as Swindler, a master manipulator. Tomoyo's usage of a regular voice not only tricks the cast of the series, but the audience too into thinking she is truly a normal person. As Swindler, her tone lowers and the scenes she encompasses are far more dramatic than comedic. When she is with Sister and Brother in particular, she uses a softer tone, taking on the role of a bigger sister for these characters.\n\nTomoyo's highlight moments thus come near the finale, where she fully embraces the Swindler role. She has a tremendous speech in Episode 11 that displays her earnest emotions to their fullest. In Episode 12, Tomoyo calls back to the “Serves you right!” line she yells in Episode 11, this time quietly, yet happily whispering this dialogue as her final words.\n\nThe beginning and ending portions of *Akudama Drive* do well to establish Tomoyo's character and the change she experiences. However, the middle section of the series lacks a solid transition in-between, and also does not contain as many stand-out moments for Tomoyo. Because of this, Tomoyo Kurosawa's role as Swindler places her in fourth place.",

Eguchi nicely conveys Hachiman's pragmatism and pessimism (realism according to Hachiman), which stands out from the total number of nominees. Because of this, however, his performance sounds monotonous, and the script doesn't provide an opportunity to show a more emotional acting. There are a few interesting scenes like Hachiman's rap scene, yet there's still not enough where Eguchi could fully explore the character through voice acting. \n\nAs a result, Eguchi's performance falls short of being impressive. *Oregairu S3*'s script didn't lend to many emotional and dramatic scenes for him to voice, which diminishes his potential to elevate Hachiman's character in this concluding season. This leads to viewers focusing on what Hachiman is saying, not in addition to how he says it; thus, the audience fails to pick up any voice subtleties to convey depth. On the other hand, Hachiman has a lot of dialogue, which is competently handled by Eguchi that decently maintains the flow of dialogue while interacting with others. But unlike other \"talkers\" like Araragi and Kyon, Hachiman lacks emotion and variety, making it difficult for Eguchi to voice impressively. \n\nThough competent and appearing more realistic, Takuya Eguchi fails to deliver a convincingly impressive performance as Hachiman to cap off the *Oregairu* series, thus landing him in tenth place for best voice acting performance of 2020.",

These moments express the drunken, stressed, and heartbroken Minare as she struggles through her day-to-day life.\n\nUnfortunately, Riho's performance contains some missteps. When ranting quickly her breathing and intonation can slip up. Sometimes her delivery is so hectic and intense she defaults to constantly yelling her lines as opposed to pacing her words out more. With the series being about radio, Riho is given a hefty script to recite. Radio relies on storytelling, and the best storytellers slowly suck the audience in. Riho's performance lacks this careful pacing, thus making the stories she recites difficult to follow and relate to. Since the dialogue can be quite self-contained, it also feels detached from the emotional energy she is giving.\n\nAside from radio segments, Riho can deliver natural, toned-down dialogue for Minare too. Even so, her best moments are still in the booth room, with Episode 1's bear face-off being her most memorable and varied performance.\n\nRiho Sugiyama certainly brings the ranty Minare Koda to life.

Being a new and significant addition to the cast sets large expectations to live up to, joining a series already known for its impactful voice acting performances. Sakamoto being a fairly notable voice actor in the industry certainly fulfills those expectations, an especially impressive feat for a role with noticeably shorter screen time than many others in *Re:Zero* and this year in general.\n\nMaaya Sakamoto manages to command every scene she is in, leaving an especially strong impression during her lengthy monologues. Echidna is an incredibly suspicious individual, pulling along both Subaru and the audience into questioning what her goals truly are. This manipulative and concerning tone is concealed wonderfully by Sakamoto through the many sudden personality shifts Echidna exhibits. Her ability to quickly mold her voice to cleanly transition between various playful, serious, and concerned attitudes exemplifies the mysterious factors surrounding Echidna.\n\nTowards the end of the season, Echidna's relationship with Subaru begins to change, with some catharsis moments coming forth due to her delicate responses toward Subaru. This soft, motherly tone elevates the already convincing script and causes further second-guessing of where Echidna's allegiances lie. Capping off the first cour with an impressively long and maddening speech - featuring plenty of nuance and intensity - Sakamoto's delivery was the crème de la crème of her performance as Echidna. Bringing all her previous variance into the spotlight and revealing the true nature of her character set Maaya Sakamoto's performance as Echidna as the second best voice acting performance of 2020.",

Her performance portrays Megumin, a talented archwizard with tunnel vision for explosion magic, returning home to her Crimson Demon village and reveals new sides to Megumin's personality. A few highlight moments in the movie are all it take for Rie Takahashi to showcase why her work as Megumin is first and foremost.\n\nBeing an absolute explosion nut, Megumin has a passionate and fiery personality much like the magic she loves so dearly. Whether it's asserting her dominance over Yunyun or casting Explosion for the umpteenth time, she talks with a chuunibyou flair that's both comical and endearing. Rie Takahashi taps into this high-octave growl that captures Megumin's arrogance without compromising her naivete, conveying an appropriate sense of immature edginess. However, what makes Megumin stand out in the movie is a more calm and mature side of her personality. Her pillow talk segments with Kazuma show that Rie Takahashi can take a one-dimensional character and provide depth and range without breaking character.\n\nWhere Megumin falls short of some of the other nominations is in screen time. For a movie about the Crimson Demon village, Megumin has surprisingly low screen time and lines, which puts a hard limit on how much Rie Takahashi can push her performance. Additionally, most of her dialogue in the movie is comical, which lends itself to repetitiveness. In a competitive field of nominees, Megumin earns a hard-fought placement at fifth.",

Subaru comes across as a believable character; be it through the gentle and warm moments of realization this season, the loud and direct playful banter with the supporting cast, or heart wrenching and nigh vocal-cord-destroying anguish. Yuusuke clearly understands the inner workings of the character he is voicing, and thus hits the highs and lows of Subaru this season incredibly well.

On top of this it features crisp visual design across a multitude of striking art styles, and a song that is well fitted to both the visuals and to the tone of the series.

Haru is somewhat sidelined, but even he is shown grimacing as he wields a gun, hinting at some past trauma.  However, NAVIGATOR didn't have as much visual creativity as the top three, which brought it down.\n\nThe OP has a second version which pays off the foreshadowing of the first by revealing the identities of the silhouetted reflections in champagne glasses.  There are some other minor narrative beats, but they aren't as strong as some of the top nominees.  Still, NAVIGATOR is easily one of the most fun OPs of the year and deserves its fourth-place finish.",

This OP simultaneously draws inspiration from Bass' work while also being its own decidedly different yet still visually pleasing OP.  The decision to draw on his work is also perfect for a show like *Great Pretender*, as it has a setting and themes similar to movies that Saul Bass also did the credits for, like Ocean's 11 or literally any movie made in the 50s.  \n\nThe visuals and song pair together to perfectly capture the feeling of *Great Pretender*, with the hustling panic in the beginning coupled with allusions to the ritz and glamour the characters purport to exude in the show.  The credits are integrated in such a way that the images of the OP would often look worse without them.\n\nHowever, GP is not perfect. Although it captures the tone of the show, it had a hard time standing out amongst other ops with stronger narrative focus. Additionally, some sequences in the middle didn't quite reach the same heights as the ones in the beginning.\n\nDespite its flaws, GP still contains a combination of exciting visuals, superb credit design, and a frenetic jazz number that perfectly came together to set the tone for the series.",

While it does a good job showing off Nasa and Tsukasa's daily life it doesn't do anything that really pushes the mould. The OP uses an alternating split screen effect previously seen in the *Chuunibyou* OP, but alternates too fast to view properly, and focuses on its side characters for too long. However, the gag with Chitose gives a good chuckle, and the part ends with a great payoff as they finally breach the divide, with a cool eye zoom shot.  \n\nThe title card is disappointing and anti-climactic, as it does little more than pan and zoom, after the intense build up that came before it. The ending wedding scene also comes across as less creative when compared to the rest of the OP.\n\nThe song's genre is atypical for an anime OP which led to a controversial reception. However, the song has strong sound design, particularly the water droplets at the start, the build-up creates a great sense of atmosphere and the lyrics tell a wonderful story from Tsukasa's point of view.\n\nWhile Koi no Uta has a lot to like, its problems hold it back from being a truly great OP. This led to a 10th place finish behind the other, more ambitious OP nominations this year.",

From the striking monochrome color palette to Vickeblanka's ominous yet energetic music, Black Catcher is committed towards a single unified vision. No aspect of the OP goes unused by the narrative, engaging the viewer and making it simple to understand the emotions of characters without having seen even a single episode of Black Clover. The ending especially stands as a testament to this for its impactful use of color in the otherwise dark world of Black Catcher.\n\nHowever,  Black Catcher's incredible commitment towards its ominous atmosphere holds it back in a few ways. Occasionally the minimalist nature of the OP backfires as some shots can hang for too long or can lack much to visually engage the viewer. Conversely, the fight sequence in the middle is eye catching with a number of interesting transitions and rotating camera work. While this section was a negative for some considering it not adding much to the narrative, it was mostly appreciated for how it fits seamlessly with the otherwise signifigant narrative sequences of Nero, Patry and Asta.\n\nDespite very minor concerns, Black Catcher is without a doubt the best Shounen OP of the year, missing first place by an incredibly narrow margin. It's clever use of lighting, exceptional atmosphere and dense narrative make its spot on this list well earned.",

Specifically, the opening highlights the past struggles of the show's protagonist, Subaru, in an emotional way, while showing glimpses into his future adversity. There's also well-executed foreshadowing hidden throughout the opening for upcoming key moments in the plot. All of this narrative work is wrapped up with great animation that showcases the show's visuals, and accompanied by the powerful voice of Suzuki Konomi.\n\nThere are, however, aspects of the production that fall short. One of the most glaring and noticeable issues is the poor handling of credits from start to finish. The transitions of the credits fading in and out draw attention away from the narrative of the opening, and the actual placement of said credits is painfully obstructive and cover up key parts of the opening. Lastly, though the animation and visuals are solid, there's a lack of visual identity or stimulation beyond the opening's narrative focus. The aesthetic of the opening is neither unique or attention grabbing, being cut straight from the show itself.\n\nSuffice to say, the strength of this opening lies in its ties to the show it was created for. Those who are invested in the story will find greater value in the opening than those who aren't or are unfamiliar with the series. It's a solid opening, but doesn't quite meet the same standard of uniqueness or ambition others on this list have strived for and achieved. ",

Shots, such as that of birds falling from the sky, and indoctrinated soldiers marching to the anthem of war, leave a strong impression in the minds of the viewers. Meanwhile, the pristine white elements stained by the contrasting rainbow colored smoke and gunfire adds to the mindless destruction that this OP seeks to portray.\n\nHowever, the OP seems to forgo narrative symbolism in favor of purely thematic ones. Because of this, its overreliance on explosions to convey these themes of war and violence leaves it with quite a bit of untapped potential. On top of that, the two shots of smoke from 0:26-0:39 seem to serve little purpose in the OP. A bit more variety in subject and composition could have elevated this OP drastically.\n\nDespite its shortcomings, ‘Boku no Sensou' still manages to excite fans and critics of the series alike with its ambitious and unforgettable showing. It confidently encapsulates the brutal subject matter of *Attack on Titan*, and for that it has earned an envious ninth spot among the best OPs 2020 had to offer.",

Everything from the cinematography, action animation, and directing are meticulously crafted and polished to create a true visual spectacle. \n\nHowever, as stunning and crisp as it is aesthetically, Kaikai Kitan unanimously falls short in its sequencing. There is an absolute abundance of near-still character frames that do not take the liberties of portraying any insight into the characters themselves. There is a considerable lack of narrative significance and personality to these frames, serving only to showcase the cast. The short bursts of action, while astonishingly well animated, serve their purpose while not adding anything new to the table. It's a safe formula, but ultimately it leaves Kaikai Kitan not only feeling rather uninspired but limited in what it wants to accomplish, like following a template.\n\nIn spite of the general lack of movement at times, most had noted that the song is paired exceptionally well to the visuals, with satisfying pacing and a melancholic, but sanguine tone.\n\nOverall, Kaikai Kitan is a visual feast. Its stunningly polished cinematography and animation is aesthetically masterclass, but shot-by-shot it is quite limited and uninteresting in its structure, which is why it lands a respectable 7th place.",

The synchronization between the music to the visuals is fantastic, as the transitions between each scene match the music perfectly. Furthermore, from 26s - 41s, the camera spins as the girls' arms rotate around like a clock which is synced up to the bass kicks. The instrumentation and background art builds up simultaneously behind the characters before the climax hits and the main dance starts up.  The flow of this ED is exceptional, and never skips a beat. Additionally, the choreography of the dance number is absolutely amazing. The music is a fantastic and catchy pop tune with a thumping kick drum and slick synthesizers to support it. To top it all off, the CGI looks quite good compared to its contemporaries. \n\nHowever, the credit placement, the lack of personal characterization, and issues with the lip-syncing were elements that brought the ED down. With that being said, this was one of the top choices that had great execution and fit the show nicely making this our third place contender.",

Many fans of *Boruto* will be at least passingly familiar with its parent story, *Naruto*, with many of them growing up with it as one of their first anime and their gateway into the anime community. It is these references that evoke nostalgia from older fans, such as Boruto's use of paint to express himself - just as Naruto did - or the opening first-person slideshow and its allusion to growing up with Naruto, that Central taps into. \n\nCentral presents a strong narrative through its use of paint to express Boruto's desire for freedom - for his own path - while still being constrained to the room or canvas he was given. However, while the narrative is quite strong, the presentation of said narrative falls short after its strong opening. From 0:40 onward, Central hangs far too long on far too many shots. Some, such as the shot of Boruto's eye, lasting eight seconds, to the next shot of him running on the lake, lasting 13 seconds, hold far too long, and the transitions between these scenes are rather rough. This continues into the second half which is primarily made up of still images and sliding cuts.\n\nYet for all these criticisms of the closing half, the strength of the opening half and the incredibly clean presentation throughout are exceptional. The animation on the water, the paint falling like rain, and the use of lighting to set the emotion of the scenes along with the impressive narrative and well thought out story stand as a testament to its fifth place spot.

The ED uses pink and teal to represent Daisuke and Haru, each starting as their respective colors and ending with mixed colors to represent the effect they have on each other- it's a nice detail even though it's a bit overt. The stills, despite being stills, are presented in a style that doesn't derail the ED, and the overall synergy the visuals have with the song is fantastic.\n\nHowever, there are major flaws that hold back ‘Welcome My Friend'. The ED is extremely unimpressive from a technical standpoint, using a large amount of stills and panning shots. The first 8 seconds of the song use autotune poorly, a jarring introduction to the rest of the song's powerful rhythm.

The ED also employs a variety of aesthetic styles to stand out from its contemporaries and play into the fact that it stems from the *Madoka* universe.\n\nThe ED has a lot of divisive elements though.

On the other hand, it's rather inconsistent as some shots don't include the character models at all, which felt a bit jarring given the focus of the other shots in the segment. The ED's elevator sequence makes use of symbolism in an intriguing way and has well-animated silhouettes, making for an engaging scene. It doesn't relay its symbolic information in the most reliable of ways however, and the bright shifting colors of the background take focus away from the scene and look rather poor. Additionally, the ED's transitions between aesthetic styles and various scenes are mostly done through hard cuts, which is jarring and brings down the ED as a whole.\n\nWhile perhaps not the peak of excellency among ED's, Alicia was still a rather enjoyable and well-executed ED, fitting for the show it represents and standing strong as the seventh place entry.",

This stylistic choice compliments the summer pop vibes of the song.  The synchronization between music and visuals is fantastic throughout, as the lyrics support the narrative of the ED. The section from 0:48 to 1:08 is particularly impressive, as the background fills up with color paired with the lyrics, \"Please fill my monochrome memories with color.\" This transitions to Hime waiting for Goto matched with the lyrics, \"My beautiful color girl.\" \n\nThe summer pop song from the 80's delivers the nostalgic, bittersweet tone matching the show. It starts with an uplifting and cheerful piano and bells section as the characters start walking towards one another and crescendos as the characters run towards one another.  At the height of the crescendo the two characters meet, the song gracefully transitions into a beautiful piano solo as the two drive off together, suggesting a fulfilling reunion.\n\nWith that being said, the ED being a walk and run cycle at its core is a detriment which ultimately leads to it being a less visually engaging experience than *Jujutsu Kaisen*'s ‘Lost in Paradise'.",

Originally created in 1955 for R&B group The Platters, the version used here is the 1987 cover by singer Freddie Mercury of Queen. The ED visuals pay homage to the music video, aping the shot of the title in the background and replacing the crooning back-up singers with cats.\n\nThe fact that the song is not original and that a portion of the ED's visuals are based on an existing music video takes away from it somewhat. On the other hand, the ED visually weaves in the arcs of the show (e.g., the acrobatic plane shot, parachuting cats, trudging through the snow, and the ring falling into the ocean) making the song pairing feel like a natural fit. The way the ED specifically depicts Laurent's journey and his relationship with Dorothy is a very effective example of visual storytelling. \n\nThe animation of the cats' movements is fluid and expressive throughout the ED, though sometimes it lingers a bit too long on certain shots, like the cat pawing at pancakes. The art style stands out, as it does in the anime, for its great use of color and its uniquely grainy appearance. The credits are also thoughtfully designed with strong choices for font, color, and placement that don't clash with each scene change.

The witch's influence is shown in the form of butterflies, bearing the same design as Echidna's hair piece. A butterfly affects every character on screen, from Ram being oblivious to the butterflies, to Rem being stuck in her sister's shadow. The ED also features Beatrice, whose hope for attention drifts just out of her grasp, and Emilia, as butterflies land on a flower similar to the one in her hair, referencing her other half, Satella.\nThat being said, the minimal animation and the carelessly placed credits took the viewer out of the experience. The subtlety of the symbolism also did not match the intense feelings of *Re:Zero* itself, creating a drastic and uncomfortable tonal shift.\n\nMemento's incredible symbolism and aesthetics of this ED surely made it one of the best of the year, but it was unfortunately held back by its flaws, ultimately putting it in ninth place.",

The song by Yuko Ando has a melancholy vibe that befits a show filled with so much death, but the visuals leave a lot to be desired.\n\nThe slow, plodding bass line provides a solid foundation which the song builds on with eerie violins. The rhythm itself isn't that spectacular, but it sets the tone of the ED excellently. The breathy vocals give the impression of someone struggling with the weight of war. The accidentals keep the viewer from becoming too comfortable, which is a fitting choice. Unfortunately, the song doesn't really evolve beyond this - it lacks a climax and doesn't explore any new motifs as it continues.\n\nThe visuals are generally well-composed. The ED has good lighting and uses color to set the mood. The shots of Falco hint at a possible tonal link between his story arc and the ED, which allows the ED to change in meaning over the course of the season. At the same time, the ED leans heavily on shots with no real narrative significance, like the glowing trees or colorful wisps. A number of shots are recycled from the show, simply adding a basic filter, doing little to recontextualize the events and consequently adding little to the experience.\n\nAll in all, the underwhelming visuals and lack of storytelling handicapped the ED, even though the song was enjoyable.",

The intriguing art style also sets this nominee apart from the rest, with its messy colored aesthetic complementing the upbeat and catchy music to give the ED a personality of its own.\n\nThe main cast takes center stage in the ED, with the expressive and smoothly animated dance sequences effectively showing off the personalities and quirks of each character. Despite multiple characters being featured here, switching between them never feels forced. The door transition is used to great effect without becoming repetitive — after the door closes on one character, it reopens shortly to another character. This is even accompanied by a change in background color, which further sets apart the various members of the main cast and their differing color schemes.\n\nThe still shots in the later half of the ED are well-drawn and consistent with the visual style, though they look comparatively lackluster after seeing the gorgeous animation in the earlier half. In spite of this, LOST IN PARADISE's amazing execution and outstanding visual style ultimately left a deep impression, propelling it past other nominees to take the spot for the first place entry.",

		"blurb": "Returning for a second year, the Script category continues the tradition of inviting immediate, intense debate about the very nature of the category and what exactly is being judged. Is an engaging, plot-driven story necessary if the script instead focuses on well-written dialogue and jokes? Do characters need to be fleshed out with meaningful development if the show is emphasizing its narrative instead? These questions and more lead to a lot of discussions, which in the end made for a very interesting category. The nominees are from all types of anime: darker, story-driven shows like *ID:Invaded* and *Re:Zero S2*, more intimate  character dramas like *Chihayafuru 3* or *Runway de Waratte*, and even light-hearted comedies like *Kaguya-sama S2* and *Eizouken*.\n\nDespite differing views on what makes a good script and the various genres up for consideration, the jury still managed to mostly agree on a final ranking, with shows like *Chihayafuru 3* and *Eizouken* very comfortably above the lower-ranked nominees, like *Runway de Waratte* and *ID:Invaded*. These shows really stood out and garnered a lot of praise, despite the strength of the other nominees. With all of the delays and cancellations affecting how many shows came out in 2020, it's great that there were still some really strong contenders in the script department.",

The highlight of the show is its focus on two protagonists, Chiyuki and Ikuto, dealing with their respective sides of the fashion industry. This isn't seamless, as during the middle of the show focusing on Ikuto's developing craft at Yanagida's studio *Runway* seemingly forgets about the existence of Chiyuki, who has her dreams ripped apart offscreen. But when done well, such as during the final competition, it creates an intriguing rivalry between them. Both Chiyuki and Ikuto work with and against each other, and together with the supporting cast tie up the character threads laid out during the season, delivering a striking finale to the show. \n\t\nHowever, *Runway* suffers from its rushed pacing up to that finale, as months go by in minutes, failing to linger on any strong emotional moments those months could have brought, with some transitions feeling almost schizophrenic. Particularly jarring is the transition between the first two episodes, with the start of episode 2 going against the aspirational tone of the first as if it had never happened. Stained by these issues, it is unsurprising that *Runway* ends up in 7th place, though the final fashion show is memorable, and the series focus on the fashion industry is novel for anime.",

The script of *Eizouken* masterfully tackles the subject by simplifying the albeit complicated process while never sacrificing the most important aspects.\n\nThis balance can be contributed to the stellar main cast of *Eizouken*. Their quirky personalities and areas of expertise create not only an enjoyable ride, but an educational experience. Asakusa's wild imagination, Mizusaki's attention to detail, and Kanamori's harsh but realistic nature results in a great cast dynamic. With the support of witty comedic writing, the end product becomes one of the best character-driven experiences found in 2020.\n\n*Eizouken* separates its story into three distinct arcs. Each builds upon the previous arc by extending the knowledge and scope of anime production. This creates a natural progression where viewers learn more about the world of anime production alongside the cast. That being said, each arc introduces new side characters to the story and the writing takes a slight hit as a result.. Their goals and personalities can't reach the same writing quality as the main cast and lower the script's overall synergy.\n\nUltimately, *Eizouken* offers a packed adventure while showing how well-written characters can carry the show. Slight issues surrounding the supporting cast hamper the experience, but it becomes less of a problem as the show goes on. Despite those aforementioned hiccups, *Eizouken* takes the well-deserved second spot in the list.",

Audiences get even more development for returning characters like Suou, Shinobu, and Harada, while also meeting new, equally-compelling characters like Inokuma, a former queen who wants to give her all to the sport again now that she is a mother. The show constantly uses metaphors and other literary devices to help convey the feeling of the matches - making sure the viewer not only understands what is happening, but also the perspective of the players themselves. This is an impressive feat, especially since karuta is such an unknown, niche sport that most viewers will not be familiar with before going in.\n\nThe jury was also very positive about the drama, whether that be character, romantic, or story-based. *Chihayafuru 3* is at a point where the motivations we have seen throughout the series start to clash, whether that be with the dynamics between the three leads or any of the side characters. That said, all the drama never becomes overbearing or feels poorly written. The show offers breaks for the viewer but it never makes you feel like you are just waiting around to move onto the next plot point. Due to all of these strengths *Chihayafuru 3* stood out among the rest, earning its well-deserved first place position.",

The cyberpunk genre isn't quite as in vogue as it used to be, but *Akudama* uses it expertly to paint a detailed picture of a world choked by invasive policing. The concept of an invasive and depersonalized cyberpunk crime prevention system is reminiscent of *Pyscho-Pass*, but changing the point of view from the police to the criminals allows *Akudama* to explore a whole different side of this concept. It had a few stumbling blocks and hiccups along the way, but it still managed to deliver one of the most memorable stories of 2020.\n\nThe biggest criticisms of the show relate to its cast of characters. They're bold, striking, and instantly memorable, but most of them don't have much going on below the surface. Some of them have more depth, but anyone watching solely because they're interested in the characters will probably be disappointed. Some of the reveals and twists in the back half of the show are also somewhat divisive, as they were quite a departure from the gritty and down-to-earth tone of the first few episodes. Hopefully any followup installments can address these issues and let this concept truly shine.",

The mystery aspects of the show were framed quite well to raise the viewers' intrigue. \n\nDespite *ID: INVADED* starting off strong with a neat concept the execution was lacking in several areas which put it a cut below the rest of the entries. The id-wells were a good idea but often felt like too much of a stretch for what they were supposed to figure out from them. The answers provided for the questions that it posed felt lack-luster. In general the final arc seemed drifted off too much into fantasy and convenience which kept it from being a conceive whole. The characters were also a mixed bag, as while they provided a unique sense of morality they at times came across as flat.\n\nWhile *ID:INVADED* created an interesting set up and posed good questions, but it's weaker ending and the strength of the other entries ended up putting it in 8th place.",

The biggest benefactor of this is Ishigami, who gets to be the focus of the sports festival arc, expanding his role and letting him develop past it as he comes to understand and even like the ‘normies' of the cheerleading club. While this development plays out quite naturally and feels fulfilling, the backstory used to set it up is out of tact for the light-hearted tone of the series and ultimately unnecessary for Ishigami's growth. Another focus character of the season is the newly introduced Miko Iino, who stirs up the existing cast dynamics in her path to join the student council, as well as introduces a fresh perspective on the other characters in her rigidly moralizing mind. \n\nWhere *Kaguya-sama's* script falters most though is in the weak, overarching plot. Even if the individual skits can be quite strong, the show ends up feeling disconnected, and lacking a cohesive narrative compared to the other character-driven nominees that earned the top spots this year.",

However, the second season's fractured nature makes evaluating the initial half on its own somewhat difficult, as much of the sequel's overarching conflict is postponed for the second half.\n\nNevertheless, there are plenty of standout moments to be found in this first part, and much of that is thanks to impressive character development and world building, something the series is known for by now. Subaru in particular received some much-needed additional backstory, and his character development was one of the highlights of this season. Among the new characters introduced, Echidna's eccentric and unpredictable nature contributed to some of the show's best scenes and helped to add to its already expansive lore. With many other new and returning characters also finding themselves the subject of the season's gripping plot twists, the show does a great job of building anticipation for the coming payoff.\n\nUltimately though, this is where the first part of *Re:Zero Season 2* suffers most: there is no payoff yet. With many of the new character arcs remaining incomplete and all of the central mysteries missing a solution, it simply lacks the means to stand completely on its own. Despite this, there are more than enough fantastic individual moments to justify placing it in fourth.",

In addition to the art style changes, sound design, OST variations, and other clever directing choices match Shinji's journey of optimism, then frustration, then resignation.\nThe tight focus on a single character and narrow themes may reduce engagement for some viewers, and the pacing overall is on the slower side, with an especially slow start which is repeatedly reinforcing the same ideas. But *Aru Nihon no Ekaki Shounen* ends on a positive note, its message about passion and enjoying your work leaving a strong impression.

The cute designs and humor juxtaposed against the harshness of their reality continues to be one of the most appealing aspects of the series.\nEach arc of *Aggretsuko* centers around characters navigating the circumstances born of their own mistakes but are rarely granted the agency to succeed. The narrative offers a veneer of optimism while teasing that moment of self-actualization audiences crave. As charming and relatable as they still are, Season 3's return to the status quo at the end undermines most of its thematic throughline. The reliance on a formulaic arc structure makes it difficult to stay positive for Retsuko's future and that of this series.  A series with such mixed messaging fails to meet the high standards set by the other nominees. For that reason, *Aggretsuko Season 3* places seventh.",

		  "writeup": "*Heya Camp* takes a bit of a spin on regular *Yuru Camp*, turning it into a slightly more comedic-focused short based around collecting stamps at different locations rather than actual camping. It carries multiple strong points over from the main series: Some of its characters, the relaxing OST, great background art, and the generally comfy atmosphere.\n\nSadly, arguably the two best aspects of the main series were largely missing from this entry: Rin and her relationship/interactions with Nadeshiko and the rest of the cast, and the ability to let the iyashikei feel of the show sink in. Chiaki, Nadeshiko, and Aoi are a good group themselves (especially for the creation of comedic moments), but Rin was the star of the show for many, and her more introverted personality unfortunately didn't fit into the premise of a group of friends going to various places for quick sightseeing. The shorter runtime also caused changes, resulting in less of a comfy iyashikei feeling. With full-length episodes *Yuru Camp* is able to spend more time on shots of scenery, giving the OST and background art plenty of time to work and bring about that cozy atmosphere the show is going for, of which *Heya Camp* did not have the luxury. \n\nOverall while this short completed what it set out to do, it was missing a lot of the soul of what made *Yuru Camp* *Yuru Camp*. While not as fulfilling as some of the other nominees, it's still a strong entry, resulting in a sixth place finish.",

The chibi character designs suit the show's playful and tongue-in-cheek tone and, though sparse in their screentime, newcomers freshen up the cast and create new opportunities for character comedy.\nWhile it was fun to see these characters outside of their shows again, many of which are darker and more dramatic in tone, questions arose over whether comedy was really the best genre choice. The show's versions of these characters felt oversimplified and thus did not meet their full potential. Unsurprisingly, *KonoSuba's* characters, themselves from a comedy show, were the funniest and most consistently enjoyable cast members this season. As a whole, the show's humor was at its best when characters were found in novel situations crafted by the crossover premise, but it was hard to ignore how much of the show relied on referential jokes from the parent shows and previous season. \nUltimately, *Isekai Quartet 2* continues its tradition of being a celebration of important characters from an influential subgenre, but disappointment at the unfulfilled potential of its premise and hit-or-miss comedy kept it at eighth place in a strong year for short-form anime.",

The jury found themselves lamenting the limits on nominations due to the number of entries which they enjoyed, other categories luckily picking up many which were passed over here. Sequel films for *ACCA* and *Saekano* acted as epilogues and final acts of their respective stories. Original IP's like *Promare*, *Her Blue Sky*, and *A Whisker Away* manage to establish their settings and weave interesting thematic and narrative threads in a bite-size portion.\n\nMany of the nominated films (and even some which weren't) were visually beautiful, several having their own unique sense of style and strengths of visual storytelling. *Ride Your Wave* celebrated a larger-than-life story with grounded designs and animation. *Lupin III: The First* was a technical marvel in adapting 2D designs to 3D, while *Promare* does the reverse, expertly incorporating 3D characters and settings into its highly stylized aesthetic. *Konosuba* and *Violet Evergarden* show off quality refinements of their aesthetics, while *Children of the Sea* and *Ongaku* take full advantage of the anime medium to tell their manga stories with beautiful animation and music.\n\nAnd with that, we are happy to present these 8 spectacular nominees for best movie released in 2020!",

The movie displays some of their biggest strengths as authors, creating a blissful experience.\n\n*Sora no Aosa* showcases excellent writing with complex character dynamics. The relationship between the Aioi sisters, Aoi and Akane, allows the film to properly convey its themes of moving forward and looking at things from a different perspective without losing out on solid development. The movie's excellent tone shifts also help to stop it from diving too deep into the territory of cheap melodrama, while still treating its characters with sympathy. \n\nAlthough the audio-visual flair of the film might not seem like much at first glance, if you look and listen closely, you'll notice how the movie's close attention to detail helps in creating a beautiful atmosphere. *Sora no Aosa*'s gorgeous backgrounds, expressive character designs, detailed and consistent animation, magnificent soundtrack, and realistic sound design make for an incredibly solid film from a production standpoint.\n\nDespite that, the visuals of *Sora no Aosa* were no match for the excellent-looking anime that landed above it. Also, the movie's messy final act and cheesy ending can definitely be disappointing for some. Because of this, the movie didn't manage to repeat the success of Nagai and Okada's 2016 collaboration, *The Anthem of the Heart*, and win the category; but ending up at the fourth spot is still a great achievement in such a strong year for anime films.",

		  "writeup": "*Ongaku* is the perfect blend of rock ‘n' roll, dry humor, stunning rotoscope animation and pure passion. It took director Kenji Iwaisawa a little over 7 years to produce this indie movie, but it was time well-spent as he managed to deliver a movie unlike any other.\n\nWith over 40,000 hand-drawn frames within this 70 minute movie, *Ongaku* is a visual spectacle. Yet it's not the number of frames nor the hand-drawn quality of these frames that make them so captivating, but the way they are directed. Shots linger on characters and build up towards hilarious, unexpected punchlines. Meanwhile, during concert scenes, the camera rotates and shakes with a hand-held quality that conveys a documentary feeling. *Ongaku* also switches up its art style to emphasize the sublime power of music. This is most notable during scenes involving the shy and gender-ambiguous Morita as they are blown away by the energy Kenji's band exudes.\n\nAside from the visuals, what really ties *Ongaku* together are the charming and eccentric characters that make the unique comedy of the movie hit spectacularly. Kenji's aimless and unpredictable attitude pairs well with his bandmates Asakura and Ota who are simple-minded yet positive individuals. In fact, everyone in *Ongaku* is a kind person, even rival gang leader Oba, and that is refreshing. It's truly endearing to watch these characters perform and love what they create, regardless of skill level.\n\n*Ongaku* is an unforgettable experience. Heartwarming, comedic, passionate and surreal, it undeniably deserves the crown for best movie of 2020.\n",

		  "writeup": "*Kaijuu no Kodomo* is a uniquely captivating movie that features some of the most jaw-dropping production in recent years. Featuring breathtaking animation, a stunning aesthetic, and masterful cinematography, the movie is a masterclass of visual production, offering an engaging experience on its own. The sound production also impresses – while the OST lacks the punch typical of Joe Hisaishi, it supports the film with a fantastical vibe, particularly the final third. Perhaps even more remarkable is the sound design, seamlessly integrating unusual elements such as whale calls and appropriately muffling sounds underwater to allow the audience to experience events as viscerally as the characters themselves.\n\nThe narrative itself is highly metaphorical, with intricate visuals offering myriad interpretations that reward rewatches. The dense experience is not without issue – the pacing and connectivity of the three acts can make the overall experience feel overly long or disparate. For example, while the first act is an excellent character story that uses a highly experiential show-not-tell style, the second focuses more on dense dialogue.  The third and final act can feel even more disjointed due to its unabashed experimental and abstract nature, although it is absolutely stunning in its own right - a true audiovisual feast for the senses.\n\nThe characters are certainly another mixed bag. Ruka is relatable with a clear and compelling arc – particularly in the first act, she makes a strong impression as she struggles with ostracization and isolation. The other characters are unfortunately less developed, giving a sense they exist solely to either catalyze development in Ruka or progress the plot.\n",

The studio's energetic style is a prime example of “more is more” that can easily sweep viewers away. *Promare* lives up to the standard, and then some. It's certainly loud, silly, colorful, over the top and never takes a single damn moment to slow down, but that's exactly what makes *Promare* irresistible. It's one of those rare instances where nearly every single aspect of its production works in harmony to achieve a much better whole: The 2D and 3D animation blend seamlessly, the loose character designs support the animation as it can go extra cartoony but superbly detailed. *Promare* is a visual feast to the eyes, and endlessly entertaining.\n\nWith its heart on the sleeves storytelling and emotional outbursts, *Promare* is at risk of not being “weighty” and “serious” enough compared to other contenders on the nomination list. In particular, the thin characterization and the simple plot remain its biggest drawbacks, but *Promare* more than makes up for it with gorgeous production quality and silly but endearing popcorn entertainment. *Promare* is all style-over-substance, but it makes a surprisingly good case that with enough love and passion, style itself can breathe itself into the world and become an integral part of its substance – as the result *Promare* stands strong and deservingly claims second place.",

The movie hits a lot of the same notes as the main series, and returning fans are likely to find themselves entertained and engaged by this latest installment. \n\nThe first half is quite strong; Isabella's characterization and arc are both robust and compelling, and her strong chemistry with Violet makes for an enjoyable watch. The symbolism is also well done, emphasizing Isabella's feelings of imprisonment. It is in the second half that the movie starts to falter. Taylor is simply not as engaging of a character as Isabella is; her circumstances are not as interesting and her struggles do not resonate as well with the viewer. Additionally, the story in the second act feels less cohesive, with the pacing being a bit slow, though not unbearably so. That said, the story here does provide an opportunity for Benedict, one of the more sidelined supporting characters from the main series, to shine, which is appreciated.\n\n*Gaiden*, like its parent series, also boasts strong production values. Its background art in particular is simply gorgeous, and the movie does not shy away from showcasing this. The robust production values serve to enhance a film that, despite its weaker second act, still earns its place among the best anime movies of 2020.",

The movie offers more characterization and depth to previously introduced characters like Bondrewd and Nanachi, which tie into our knowledge of the Abyss and its mysteries. Strong visuals help bring out the emotional intensity of the content and stellar backgrounds of the Abyss; when present, they contribute to the work's strong visual production. The audio production is just as good, as the OST and sound design draw a lot of praise for its usage with how well it is able to amplify the scenes.\n\nWhile *Dawn of the Deep Soul* has a lot to offer, there are key shortcomings that place it lower than other entries in the category. While some characters are quite strong, others are reduced to mere plot devices. The focus on the action rather than the adventure and scenery that the TV show focused on does not play to the series' strengths as well. Another negative is that the movie has aspects that are distasteful and should have been cut. Despite all of that, *Dawn of the Deep Soul* succeeds in telling a harrowing tale as the heroes make their journey deeper into the Abyss, securing itself as the 5th best movie of the year.",

The film stands apart from previous Shinkai works with its vibrant cast and bold ending.\n\n*Tenki* separates itself from the other nominees with its energetic character animation and lifelike depiction of the Tokyo cityscape. The beautiful visuals root the fantastical story in reality, while also adding personality and emotion to the cast. However, visual production alone doesn't make a movie, and *Tenki*'s narrative suffers from jarring tone shifts and a very hit-or-miss ending. Once the climax begins, the film's focus is all over the place - switching between comedic scenes with Nagi, an action-filled chase with witty one-liners, and emotional moments for Hodaka and Keisuke. The constant whiplash takes away from the film's serious approach. The soundtrack is also used poorly, with insert songs feeling awkward rather than emotional. \n\nFor better or for worse, the ending of *Tenki* is its most memorable aspect. Hodaka's decision at the film's climax is refreshing and offers criticism of Japan's intergenerational relationships. However, the ending also suffers from a lack of moral clarity, arguably endorsing the problematic consequences of Hodaka's decision as he receives no retribution for the aftermath of his actions. \n\nThe film's weak script and messy ending hold it to last place in the category, but its premier production and vibrant cast keep the film engaging, proving *Tenki no Ko* deserves recognition as one of the best films of the year.",

Staff, is the latest installment of Natsume Akatsuki's beloved comedy isekai. \n\nKnown as *Legend of Crimson* in English, it humbly continues the show's formula of self-absorbed characters and raunchy lowbrow humor. Without any new ideas though, it struggles to create a memorable experience. Satisfied with being “more *KonoSuba*”, this sequel will not woo those still unimpressed by constant vulgar gags. Even the movie's climactic fight is hampered by anime-original content that doubles the length of an already tedious scene.\n\nHowever, the movie shines with its focus on Megumin who receives well-needed development. Her arrogance masks her insecurity towards her own magical ability, and it is this inner doubt she strives to conquer over the course of the story. Yunyun also shares the spotlight with Megumin, both gaining confidence and respect for each other through a common desire to improve. Kazuma and Megumin's relationship progresses as well, although, the sexual harassment makes it difficult to want them to be together.\n\nOn the production side, noteworthy moments of effects animation underscore the sheer cathartic energy of explosion magic. Similarly, the feature film production schedule allowed for solidly-composed background art that shows off the Crimson Demon Village's rural beauty. Unfortunately, directorial powerhouses further up the list dwarf *KonoSuba's* occasional visual prowess.\n\nHence, *Legend of Crimson* is a perfectly funny addition to the *KonoSuba* franchise, but its lack of ambition holds it back from taking a higher position on the rankings.",

This time around, however, the show has moved away from its previous focus on hunting down the tattooed prisoners to find the location of the stolen ainu gold.

The season also has some excellent focus episodes for Ogata and Tsurumi, allowing viewers to appreciate these interesting characters even more. \n\nHowever, the show's sense of humor can be seen as divisive.

Harada, Suo, and Inokuma all feature prominently with arcs that are excellent in their own right. Befitting Harada's mantra that “individual matches are team matches,” these arcs also serve to enrich the main characters' development by providing parallels to recontextualize or provide insight. The main characters nonetheless have fantastic character moments and receive significant treatment. Taichi, in particular, has a satisfying resolution to his core arc developed over three seasons.\n\n\nThe production in *Chihayafuru 3* supports the phenomenal narrative. While the animation isn't jaw-dropping, the direction nevertheless manages to capture the frenetic sport of karuta, and masterful boarding excellently supports characterization and theming. Apropos for a sport where hearing is imperative, sound production is superb. Featuring meticulous foley, the sound design sells the necessary experience of karuta matches. OST usage is great, using motifs to provide connectivity with previous seasons and featuring a range of tracks to suit the wide-ranging emotive milieu. VA work is excellent, featuring a standout performance by Mamoru Miyano as Taichi to sell a nuanced and passionate portrayal, as well as Kenta Miyake replacing the late Unshou Ishizuka in Harada's role.\n\n\nWith fantastic narrative and character arcs and exemplary production to tie it together, *Chihayafuru 3* is an instant classic that will be loved for years and easily merits the top award this year.\n",

This season provides some much needed character development and intriguing new adversaries in Inarizaki. Looking more directly at the cast, Hinata's growth into a well-rounded player felt like a fresh change of perspective, and further, Tanaka and Shimizu appreciate some much needed drama which works wonders to strengthen their characters and match the rest of the team. \n\nStill, the game of volleyball is what takes center court in *Haikyuu*, and the second round match is a highlight. Through the charismatic antagonists of the Miya twins, Inarizaki feel like a true threat to Karasuno, which intensifies the hype climaxes for which *Haikyuu* is known.  However, a lack of personal rivalry between the two teams and the haphazard pacing (especially the sudden cutaway to the Nekoma match which felt jarring and out of place) affects the viewer's ability to stay engaged and invested in the outcome. \n\nOn the production side, *To the Top* unfortunately is a step down from the wonderfully chaotic visual production of previous seasons . While the show still contains intense and strong action animation, this season lacks *Haikyuu*'s previous consistency and contains many distracting off-model shots due to the new character designs.\n\nNevertheless, despite several hiccups, *To the Top* earns its place among the best of the year.\n",

Studio Pierrot and Too Kyo Games knit together a surprising pastiche of disparate influences: some will recognize the narrative touch of *Danganronpa*'s Kazutaka Kodaka, others the series' nods to American pulp film and cyberpunk.\n\n*Akudama* runs rampant visually, taking pleasure in building and shattering a neon vision of futuristic Kansai. Kansai here is tattooed with visual graffiti and drips a palette of neon purples, pinks and blues. It's a retro futuristic vision that balances bleak grit and sleazy glamour in equal measure, but with enough bite to distinguish itself from forebears like *Blade Runner* or *Ghost in The Shell*.\n\nIf *Akudama* does stumble on its sprint, it does so with its cast, who don't quite carry the energy or depth necessary to keep up with the visual and narrative pace. Characters like Hacker and Doctor lack the development necessary to impart *Akudama* with the Tarantino-esque dynamics it aspires for. The narrative also sometimes trips, with the midway shift from the simple heist format being a particular sticking point, as well as lacking a deeper dissection of the setting of Kansai amidst the havoc.\n\nFor better or worse, *Akudama*'s biggest weakness is becoming a victim of its own pace — a series that might have benefited from a more measured, composed gait. \n",

		  "writeup": "Despite some pacing issues and a bit of a weak plot, *Oregairu 3* still managed to bring a satisfying conclusion to the series. As always, this season features  the familiar great dialogue and interesting character dynamics. Yui in particular stood out this season with her struggle to deal with the impending doom of her interpersonal relationships. While the prom plot isn't the best, it allowed for some great moments of development for Yukino and Hachiman and provided a reasonable excuse for the return of some fan-favorites. The two leads finally come into their own as individuals. Outside of the prom plot, the opening and ending episodes are some of the strongest in the series, with the very heartwarming episode between Hachiman and his sister, and the extremely satisfying climax and epilogue in episode 11. The production wasn't the best in the category, but still had some great voice acting and lighting that effectively conveyed the mood. Overall, *Oregairu 3* is a very controversial entry among fans and seemingly everyone else that watches it. At its heart, however, it's still the same beloved series and maintains much of what people love about it.\n",

		  "writeup": "*Great Pretender* is one of the most unique and charismatic anime this year. With charming characters, good chemistry among the main and supporting cast, and a slew of stunning visuals; it's hard not to be impressed by its presentation.\n\nThe visual production features excellent color design, stunning backgrounds inspired by British painter Brian Cook, and strong compositing. It also features highly charismatic character designs with consistent on-model animation. These elements delicately coalesce into a satisfying aesthetic. When it comes to the audio presentation, the soundtrack evokes an atmospheric and at times dramatic presence that elevates scenes. The vocal casting is efficiently used to deliver dialogue in a snappy and engaging manner.\n\nThe meat of the story is delicately wrapped in heist schemes, reminiscent of older films like *Ocean's Eleven* and neatly used to create thrilling dramatic sequences with subtle character drama focused on past traumatic experiences. The show embraces these themes and uses them as a medium to push character struggles onwards in a hopeful tone.\n\nThe biggest misstep lies in the uneven story arcs. While Los Angeles Connection and Snow of London were universally praised for their tightness and consistency, Singapore Sky and Wizard of Far East especially have issues, notably pacing and unclear character motives. The ending is also quite divisive given how the heist becomes more incredulous towards the end.\n\nNevertheless, *Great Pretender* is a passionate work that offers much to love: a great cast, good audiovisuals, and a fun story motif that ornately highlights its other elements.\n",

		  "writeup": "*Eizouken ni wa Te wo Dasu na!* is Masaaki Yuasa and Sumito Oowara's heartfelt celebration of the animation industry, dripping with sincere veneration for the hard work, creativity, and passion of everyone involved in anime creation.\n\nWhat better way to celebrate production than to excel at it? Striking and malleable character designs brimming with personality contribute to the show's highly expressive character animation. Meanwhile, the detailed and vibrant background art and the ink-and-pen sketchbook art style lend an elemental beauty to the imagination sequences.\n\nNoteworthy as well are the three leads who carry the series, both with their engaging chemistry as well as their straightforward but endearing drive to make the best possible product they can craft. While their writing may initially come off simplistic, flashback episodes expand on some characters' motivations, rooting their passions in experiences that have shaped them.\n\nHowever, the core appeal lies in its overview of anime creation and the creative decisions involved. Most appreciated is its depiction of the many external forces that challenge creators, elevating the story from a mere explanation of the production line. The show definitively states that creativity is a process full of change and sacrifice, even if it may tone down the unethical practices of the industry.\n\nUltimately, *Eizouken* makes clear what keeps creators in a career not easy to work in, and with its stellar production and charismatic cast, it earns its place as the third-best anime of the year.\n",

		  "writeup": "*Kaguya-sama Season 2* is an improvement on everything that made its previous season a massive hit. Although *Kaguya-sama* doesn't reinvent its genre, it understands very well how romantic comedies work and uses that to its advantage, poking fun at its clichés while also being a charming exploration of teenage insecurities.\n\nThe addition of Iino, as well as a very solid arc for Ishigami, help to elevate an already strong cast of characters to amazing highs. This creates interesting dynamics between all of our protagonists that are simultaneously hilarious and touching. Every character in the series brings something to the table and their well-established personalities bounce off each other perfectly to create a show that is simply brimming with delightful comedy.\n\nThis comedy is intensified thanks to the efforts of its acclaimed staff, with Mamoru Hatakeyama of *Rakugo* fame at the forefront as the director. The show features incredibly solid production values, notably its impressive animation and some of the best storyboarding in anime this year. *Kaguya-sama* takes its already strong core comedy and utilizes its medium to make a truly outstanding celebration of creative visual gags.\n\nEven though the series doesn't push the envelope in what romantic comedies might be, and doesn't have as strong an overall narrative as season 3 of *Chihayafuru*, *Kaguya-sama* still managed to become an excellent series in its own right. And because of that, it absolutely deserved its spot as the second best anime of the year.",

		  "writeup": "*Re:Zero Season 2* is a wonderful addition to an already incredibly praised series. Starting off on a strong but rather controversial circumstance, this season does an excellent job of establishing how far Natsuki Subaru has come as a person, yet also how much farther he has to go in order to accomplish his goals and support the people he cares about. The new cast of characters are varied but interesting, playing into the mystery focus of the arc while contributing some solid world-building for the series as a whole. Many significant moments recontextualize how the previous season was interpreted, elevating and adding further depth to the main and supporting cast, while also amplifying the themes of the series. Subaru's suffering is at an all time high this season. His pain sets up compelling plotlines for the remaining half of the fourth arc and does not feel wasteful or pointless.\n\nMany themes and developments this season rely on a satisfying payoff in the second cour which has yet to air and was not eligible. Considering there was some incredibly strong competition this year, this limited placing the show overly high within the ranking. In addition, while the directing and storyboarding makes the series suspenseful, interesting, and produces emotional draws for the audience, the split cour nature and pandemic delays unfortunately hurt the visual production of the series.\n\nRegardless, *Re:Zero Season 2* offers another thrilling and enthralling experience with numerous impactful, memorable revelations, absolutely deserving of its position as one of the best anime of the year.\n",
