Shows like *Blue Lock* with its fun and over-the-top tone, *NieR: Automata Ver1.1a* and its beautiful visuals, and *My Hero Academia Season 6* with its solid characterization caught the attention of certain jurors but ultimately did not make it to the final nominations due to other entries having stronger support.  *Scott Pilgrim* and its unique aesthetic stood out to many jurors while Gridman Universe’s satisfying conclusion to its previous installments made it a worthwhile choice for others. Add that with the intricate plotting of *Bungou Stray Dogs Seasons 4 and 5* and the creative and dynamic action scenes offered by *Bleach*’s most recent season and the public nominees, the task of deciding the ranking of many shows and movies with a variety of strong points became more complex.   With a total of four jurors, the rankings needed to be decided by discussion rather than by voting which led to some interesting discourse. What makes a story’s writing compelling? In what ways do the production and design elements of a show elevate it? Does a sequel entry's role in the greater narrative affect how it is viewed? All of these questions were considered as the jury came up with a ranking that takes into account the strengths and weaknesses of each entry.",

Dynazenon* that acts as a satisfying conclusion for several of the characters while also embracing the Tokusatsu genre to deliver fantastic action sequences. The movie centers around Rika and Yuuta by providing the much-needed development that results in a relatable and endearing relationship that was only explored on a surface level in the original series. The cast of Dynazenon and their interactions with the Gridman characters are also executed exceptionally well, with their conversations feeling natural and appropriate for the characters' ages.\n\n\nThe action sequences of the film continue to deliver epic Kaiju battles and utilize the crossover to create various new mech combinations. While this keeps the fights exciting and is central to the appeal of the series, the action scenes don't go beyond big robots fighting kaiju and leave room for more creative fights. In *SSSS. Dynazenon*, Dynazenon would break apart into its individual pieces so that each part could fight and move freely, which could have led to some interesting battles in the film if it was included. The use of CGI for the action scenes is nothing out of the ordinary for long-time fans, but for newcomers the models can appear jarring when contrasted with the hand drawn characters.\n\n\nUltimately Gridman: Universe serves as the capstone of the series that takes everything great from its predecessors and crafts a story that will leave longtime fans satisfied.",

Within these seasons, it goes to explore the evolving partnerships and marriage of convenience between otherwise conflicting organizations in the face of new threats, and how these previous relationships influence the individual characters from each organization.\n\n\nAnd it is through the exploration of its cast that the show does its best, which is highlighting, enhancing, or even reinventing key characters, as previous characters that were on the sidelines during previous seasons manage to steal the spotlight as if they are now the stars of the show. Complementary to this, the new antagonists during these seasons were able to bring about a renewed sense of danger, as they seemed to be an unstoppable force that is always one step ahead of detective agency, allowing for an interesting showdown. \n\n\nThat being said, persistent flaws within this series still came about, one of which is that jarring tonal shifts between scenes were common occurrences, and that some of the gigabrain moves that some characters were doing could only make sense through a bit too much suspension of disbelief. However, putting these two aspects aside, these two seasons allowed for lots of twists and turns, insane fights, and emotional moments that made them an interesting watch.",

          "writeup": "*Scott Pilgrim Takes Off* is an excellent addition to the *Scott Pilgrim* universe, building on the established graphic novels and film. If you haven't seen them yet, you should certainly stop here and go watch them as the premise takes new storylines and a twist on familiar characters that provides an entirely new perspective on the franchise. The writing by original author Bryan Lee O'Malley also balances the absurdity and comedy with real emotional moments as characters come to realizations about themselves, allowing nearly every character sees significant expansion from the original works\n\n\nThe animated medium not only adds new dimensions to the characters of *Scott Pilgrim* but also proves to be perfect for the series, enabling the show to feature dynamic and varied action scenes that just wouldn't be possible in live action. From exaggerated postures to old-school Kanade-inspired sequences, *Scott Pilgrim Takes Off* is a remarkable adaptation from comic to anime. Yet, it's the music that truly sets the show apart. Featuring classics such as “Police Truck” by Dead Kennedys, the soundtrack not only scratches the *Tony Hawk's Pro Skater nostalgia itch* but also does an outstanding job of accentuating the proper tone of the show and characters, seamlessly melding sound with animation to create a rich, immersive experience.\n\n\nWith only a slight stumble in its ending, *Scott Pilgrim Takes Off* rightfully earns its spot as one of the top action shows of 2023.",

          "writeup": "This season of Demon Slayer continues with the top-notch production that the show is known for with its sound, choreography, and dynamic animation resulting in some very strong and interesting action sequences. Whether it's the smooth and realistic sound of a sword being unsheathed, the vivid and stylistic flames that Tanjiro wields in battle, or the well-thought-out tracking shots that keep the viewers caught up in the action, the show pulls out all the stops in making each fight an exciting, visual treat.\n\n\nThis season also expands its cast while also giving depth to established characters, such as showing the reasoning behind Mitsuri's decision to join the Demon Slayer Corps and the history behind Muzan's descent into his villainous ways. Although new characters serve the plot well enough, they do not have the same level of appeal or intrigue as those introduced in previous seasons, and while the show does its best to flesh these characters out with detailed backstories, the emotional beats do not land as strongly due to them feeling similar to ones the show has shown in the past.The villains for this season also lack a strong intimidation factor, which affects the amount of tension for the conflict in this season even with the show's well animated fight scenes.\n\n\nAlthough the show continues with the themes that have been present throughout the story that fans have grown to love, Demon Slayer's reluctance to deviate from the established formula of previous seasons can at times make the show feel predictable with its storytelling and the pacing at times leaves the story feeling drawn out compared to other entries that feel much tighter with their storytelling.",

          "writeup": "This season of *Bleach* was just a constant onslaught of phenomenal fights all around, fleshing out in a creative way the unique powers of both the Soul Reapers and the Quincies, which sometimes jumps into bizarre battles in which the feats each character shows are downright surreal. From this, the anime utilized well its sizable cast, emphasizing their key features and abilities so as to leave a lasting impression. \n\n\nIt also does a good job on its worldbuilding, particularly on the underlying conflict between Soul Reapers and Quincies and on the background of Yhwach, who started as an enigmatic figure and for whom the show expanded both on his background and the purpose of his current actions. From the Soul Reapers' side there's the more prominent involvement of squad zero, whose imposing presence is duly exploited within this season, as their deeds during the climax were the most compelling part of this season. \n\n\nThat being said, this season wasn't as strong as its previous one, nor does it feel like it would be a solid contender when seen on its own. It suffers from being basically an in-between season, as some developments within the story didn't do much besides laying the groundwork for better things to come. That, and Ichigo being basically irrelevant during this season, makes it less of a contender when compared to other entries that have developed that reach new heights within their stories. Even so, what the show managed to build during this season seems to be a strong foundation for the things to come, as there's an expectation of what could come next after seeing such a great finale.",

          "writeup": "The Gundam franchise is well known for its exploration of topics of war, oppression, and corruption, and *Gundam: The Witch from Mercury* is no different in that regard. With its large cast, the show manages to have a few standout characters. The relationship between the two likable leads, Suletta and Miorine, serves as a core part of the show, and they balance each other well as they aid in each other's growth throughout the story. Other characters get their chances to shine and bring some twists and a level of nuance to the story. The action scenes deliver a high level of intensity to the show and are bolstered by vibrant mechs that stay true to the franchise's iconic designs, a variety of interesting settings, and slick and fluid 2D animation. \n\n\nWhile the first part of the story does a decent job of setting up its characters and an interesting plot, *Gundam: Witch from Mercury* feels like it could have benefited from more episodes to truly tackle its themes at a deeper level. With so many topics to cover in a twelve-episode cour, the show does not appear to have the time to fully flesh out the topics that it sets out to explore leaving the second half of the show to at times feel rushed, confusing, or unclear with its ideas and ending up with a less satisfying conclusion than it could have had.",

          "writeup": "The isekai genre has grown stale over the years, but *The Eminence in Shadow* manages to reinvigorate it with its satiric take on the trope. Obsessed with becoming the powerful \"Eminence in Shadow\" in his chuuni fantasies, Cid unexpectedly finds himself in a new world after a truck accident and is thrust into what he believes is a fictitious conspiracy. \n\n\nThe action scenes can't contend with the top entries in the category, but they are competent and varied enough to be entertaining. Cid's personality in general leans into trying to make fights as dramatic as possible which makes for a fun viewing experience, and is epitomized by his iconic “I. Am. Atomic!” \n\n\nThe real highlights of *The Eminence in Shadow* are its comedy and female characters. The show never takes itself too seriously despite how over-the-top it can be at times, and Cid's insistence on trying to be a background character with his everyday persona leads to many humorous moments. The bevy of women he accumulates around himself are not only eye candy but interesting characters in their own rights, something few shows can lay claim to. Although the show excels in certain qualities, it unfortunately suffers from pacing issues and lacks depth in its ensemble of characters. Additionally, its animation is weaker compared to others, which diminishes its potential for greatness to merely modest appeal.\n\n\nStill, there is a little something here for everyone, and it is not hard to see why the show became as popular as it has.",

          "writeup": "*Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2* takes the strong foundation of season 1 and elevates to a standard unseen in recent shonen adaptations. The Hidden Inventory arc starts the season off with the story about Gojo, Geto, and their conflict with Toji. This arc does an excellent job at humanizing Gojo and Geto, recontextualizing their relationship and adding emotional weight to their future confrontations. This arc additionally utilizes its soundtrack to emphasize atmosphere very well, with the track ‘一緒なら' capturing Gojo's heavenly aura perfectly. The Shibuya arc that follows delivers exceptional fight scenes that each one up the last. While the most memorable fights center around Yuji, Sukuna, and Mahito due to their emotional weight and exceptional visual presentation, a majority of the cast gets their moment to shine which helps emphasize the scale of the Shibuya conflict. Mahito's voice actor in particular delivers an unforgettable performance that encapsulates the childish arrogance and nasty nature of Mahito's character. \n\n\nThe production of this season, although at the cost of overworking its animators, is jaw-dropping. Each fight is animated to a high standard that showcases the creativity and love the staff have for this show, and the various homages to other media such as *Neon Genesis Evangelion* and *The Raid 2* make each episode a treat to watch.  Alongside a spectacular soundtrack and phenomenal vocal performances, *Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2* pulls out all the stops to produce an unforgettable season that will be remembered for years to come. A truly momentous achievement for Shonen anime. ",

However, that’s not to say that new anime didn’t hold their own this year! *Kaina of the Great Snow Sea* captured the jury with its brilliant atmosphere, and isekai of all stripes, from the relaxing *Farming in Another World* to the highly exaggerated *Reborn to Master the Blade*, once again filled the category. At the end of it all, a few fantastic nominees were able to rise to the top. *Zom 100* and *Dr. Stone* showed us all a world of cheer and wonder, even in their darkest moments. *Nier Automata v. 1.1a* captured an evocative tone, with such emotions only able to be matched by Makoto Shinkai’s next work in *Suzume*. Legacies old and new were carried forth with *Mushoku Tensei II* and *Golden Kamuy*’s fourth season. *Helck* was a uniquely creative experience with an abundance of hidden value, and *Trigun Stampede* reinvented a classic for its own brand of storytelling.",

Helck himself appears comically strong and optimistic, which plays perfectly off of Vermilio's energetic reactions to her sabotage attempts being thwarted in ridiculous ways. The side characters feed into the lighthearted tone with their respective brands of goofiness, peaking with Piwi being an adorable and unpredictable fuzzball.\n\n\nDespite being humorous and entertaining in its own right, a large portion of Helck features little progress regarding the overall story. Although the suspense behind Helck's true motivations is commendable, the hijinks become tiring to sit through by the time larger plot details are introduced. While the content itself is enjoyable the pacing drags it down with inconsequential detours often interrupting the main narrative and flashbacks spanning several episodes of painstaking detail.\n\n\nThe second half delves into Helck's side of the story, adding context to his actions and the political strife at the core of the narrative. The show crafts a narratively compelling world, and capitalizes on subtle yet meaningful foreshadowing through the unveiling of Helck's tragic past. \n\n\nThe anime's strongest suite is the charming interpersonal relationship between the cast, which continues to grow even up to the very final episode. Vermilio and Helck's friendship remains the highlight, with her increasing desire to support Helck's true wishes leading to a heartfelt conclusion.",

Whether it's something as simple as seeing a machine take joy in planting flowers, Jackass engaging in a leisure activity like fishing, or seeing groups of machines come together to mimic different kinds of societies, these moments are when the story is at its richest. This is complimented by a beautiful, melancholic atmosphere created by the show's aesthetic and soundtrack.\n \n\nCertain elements of the show are more hit or miss. In terms of characters, Adam and Eve don't make for compelling villains, lacking depth and having ill-explored motivations. While 2B and 9S do have a good dynamic with their contrasting personalities, 2B's stoicism can come across as bland and one-note. As for the action sequences, there are composition issues with clunky usage of CG effects, notably in the pilot episode, but 9S' hacking sequences are creative, and 2B's fight choreography with her swordplay is enjoyable to watch.\n \n\nOverall, *Nier: Automata Ver1.1a*'s atmosphere and exploration of war and humanity make it a compelling watch for both newcomers and veterans alike.",

Tsurumi's faction was the biggest standout of this season with interesting information being brought to light regarding how he has formed his gaggle of “perfect soldiers.” Tsurumi had perhaps the least screen time in this screentime compared to the others, yet his presence in the story is larger than life, all the while the show creates a lot of intrigue about his actual goal.\n\n\nDespite its inconclusive end, this season is a great buildup to the finale of the show, fleshing out and adding depth to many of its side characters. Additionally, the bond and future plans of the main characters Asirpa and Sugimoto are put to the test, creating interesting tension in a long established dynamic.",

The series dives right into the story and rarely lets off the breaks as the characters traverse No Man's Land, delivering an action spectacle that tackles themes of environmentalism, religion, family, and revenge.\n \n\nThe pacing can work against the series, however. While it remains consistently exciting and never fails to deliver on the action, the speed at which the series moves makes it hard to keep up, and while Vash is an engaging leading man, there's little space for developing relationships among the wider cast.\n \n\nA big selling point of the series is its action sequences and overall production. The world of No Man's Land is made stunning through detailed background art and fantastic use of vivid colors, light, and shadow. Characters are expressive and animated exceptionally well. They always move and gesture whenever they're on screen, which helps flesh out their personalities. Epic in scope, the action sequences are elevated by dynamic camerawork and a variety of angles and wideshots to give a sense of grandeur.\n \n\n*TRIGUN STAMPEDE* makes up for its faults by delivering entertaining spectacle and an interesting world that's hard to take your eyes off.

In the film, titular character Suzume adventures through Japan closing mythical doors with her older crush-turned-chair Souta. While on her journey Suzume faces many aspects of herself, collecting memories of her past and learning how to face her past tragedies. Along with her aunt, they both come to terms with and work to resolve their familial relationship.\n\n\nAs expected, the production of this film both visually and musically is a major highlight. *Suzume* excels by incorporating a large amount of variety in its soundtrack. This includes nostalgic retro hits as Suzume and her gang drive across Japan, such as themes from *Karekano* and *Penguin's Memory: Shiawase Monogatari*. The background art is also stunning, with a focus on abandoned environments like theme parks and schools. The decay and isolation of these settings gives a fantasy touch to the film and contrasts to the urban flair the populated city locations have. The environments also heavily connect to the themes of the film, as these locations are remnants of the past, irreversibly shaken by the passage of time and tragedies, but not completely destroyed. Thus, they are depicting physical yet decaying memories that remain as a reminder of the past. What Shinkai poses to the audience is whether these environments should remain forgotten or confronted and revitalized.\n\n\nWith fantastic characters and themes propped up by beautiful background art and a great soundtrack, *Suzumu* excels in all aspects.",

One especially has little presence in the story in this season, and instead serves as a hook for the next one.\n\n\nThe cast's large size is still used well, with characters falling into expected roles and teams as they cooperate on large scale engineering projects. In this way every character feels important to the overall goal. At the same time, the cast is quite bloated and not every character's screentime feels earned, and some are generally significantly less interesting overall.\n\n\nOne of the strongest aspects of this series is the forward momentum created as interesting mysteries arise, driving the characters to invent. This creates a natural flow from one invention to the next all while maintaining a logical link between them through the use of technological ages. Inventions that came up previously are used time and time again to aid in the creation of the next one. *Dr. Stone* always feels like it's moving towards meaningful progress, making it addicting to watch.",

It delivers on a fun ride full of fights against zombies and, unexpectedly, the joys of being free to pursue one's own desires.\n\n\nLikening the exhaustion caused by corporate exploitation to literal zombies makes for a catchy introduction to the show's atmosphere, which continues to be expanded upon through Akira's interactions with the rest of the cast. Shizuka's caution and grouchiness serves to ground Akira and Kencho's relentless enthusiasm, and Beatrix further adds a cheeky layer of chaos to the group's dynamics by simultaneously being an enthusiastic extrovert and a badass samurai.\n\n\nStrong visuals keep the show's momentum going throughout its runtime. The core theme of rediscovering one's true motivations is enhanced greatly through stark shifts in color and lighting, with the bleak moments being oppressively dull and lifeless as opposed to the rest of the show's vibrance. Well-directed yet ridiculous action sequences round off the emotional moments with their immensely enjoyable spectacle, thanks in no small part to the soundtrack.\n\n\nThe back half of the show features decent development from Akira and Shizuka; their relationship being handled with a commendable degree of sensitivity. Akira reconnecting with his father in particular suitably caps off the bombastic final arc, and his newfound goal leaves much to look forward to for the next step in the journey.

Simple yet realistic backgrounds lend character to the towns of Rosenberg and Ranoa. Additionally, the few well-animated action sequences show off Rudeus' growth while being thoroughly entertaining and memorable thanks to their spectacle. Rudeus slowly earning the trust of Counter Arrow and his unexpected friendship with Soldat are a joy to watch, and the first few episodes set in Rosenberg is a strong start to the season.\n\n\nUnfortunately the rest of the season is a bumpy ride. As interesting of a setting as a magic university sounds, the fantasy elements are underutilized, with the focus being squarely on meeting lackluster side-characters. While Rudeus' attempts at self-improvement are admirable, the show's poorly executed attempts at broaching sensitive topics only serve to invalidate any development he may have undergone. His interactions with the disguised Sylphie are as charming as they are frustrating due to the slow pace of progress. The inclusion of sexual elements in particular is unnecessary, with some moments crossing the line to being reprehensible.\n\n\nDespite a few bumps on the way, season 2's first half expands on the interesting world and ends with a suitable climax, resulting in a solid season.",

Mia's tendency to fall upwards is a standout aspect of the show's humor, which allows for many fun interactions that originate from her silly schemes and pettiness. \n\n\nThe humor wouldn't be as effective if it wasn't for Mia's selfish and immature side that, thanks to her silly portrayal, comes off more as charming than arrogant. And despite her final goal being inherently selfish, she is also on a journey of gratitude, learning to appreciate the things and connections she has while trying to spread that happiness to the rest of her country.\n\n\nThe political aspect however makes for some long winded scenes that are rather shallow, long, dull, and with on the nose commentary. Mia often provides comedic relief that helps lighten the mood but her role in these scenes can be repetitive. Many of these dynamics also fall short as most other side characters are bland and undeveloped. \n\n\nWhile Mia's creative expressions and other chibi gags are a nice highlight, the rest of the anime is visually underwhelming. Production delivers an anime that looks fine but it misses out on being memorable due to its minimal animation and uninspired art.\n\n\nDespite issues with underdeveloped characters and inconsistent pacing, *Tearmoon Empire* is an entertaining story thanks to the contrast of Mia's mischievous and selfish nature with her becoming a genuinely good person in this new life of hers.\n",

          "writeup": "*Urusei Yatsura (2022)* introduces to a new audience one of the most beloved works done by Rumiko Takahashi. By bringing it back to the spotlight, it attempts to give a new look to an old classic, which was already known for striking a balance between a daily high school setting and shenanigans that are literally out of this world. \n\n\nA good chunk of the charm comes from its sizable cast, including not only actual aliens but also all sorts of bizarre and unique people who introduce new twists to the daily life dynamics within the show. The colorful aesthetic highlights and exaggerates each character's mood and personality, while at the same time using visual cues that seem straight out of a gag manga. These aspects reinforce the retro feel of the anime, and allow for a better depiction of its cast.\n\n\nHowever, the anime suffers from a lack of consistency throughout its run. Some episodes nail the comedy while others completely miss the mark. The quality varies drastically even between different skits within the same episode, turning the final product into more of a mixed bag. \n\n\nThat being said, *Urusei Yatsura (2022)* manages to showcase its charm even within its weakest episodes, from hearing Lum saying “darling”, to Ataru's failed attempts at being a womanizer, to the variety that the supporting cast brings about. Overall, this anime does a good job at being both simple and bombastic, and manages to keep itself fresh all throughout its run.\n",

          "writeup": "There are few shows more memorable this year than *KamiKatsu: Working for God in a Godless World*. Whether you love it or hate it you will remember this show after finishing it. It starts off forsaking the standard truck-kun isekai opening for one where our main character Yukito is killed off in a ritual sacrifice by his father. Next Yukito is being revived by a buxom pink haired girl giving him a handjob. This is the opening three minutes of the show, and it manages to keep this energy fairly consistently for the duration of the season.\n\n\nOften described as a parody or inside joke in anime form, this show has a charm that is rarely seen. The extra janky CGI monsters, the random pixel art scenes, the often gratuitous ecchi scenes that have clearly had extra time spent on animating them, and the infamous tractor scene. Of course, these charms are not for everyone and many would justifiably criticize these aspects.\n\n\nDespite its rather satirical portrayal of its narrative, *Kaminaki* has character moments that feel genuine and rewarding, such as Yukito's slow but eventual warming up to the rest of the cast.\n\n\nThere is a certain acquired taste needed to appreciate this show, but once one adapts to it they are in for quite the enjoyable ride as it is clear that this was a labor of love from all involved in making it.\n",

          "writeup": "*Horimiya: Piece* captures the essence of high school life and goofy adolescent relationships, making it relatable and engaging. Miyamura and Hori's relationship is portrayed authentically with moments of vulnerability and support while supporting characters like Remi, Yuki, and Shuu add depth and humor to the storyline, enhancing the overall enjoyment of the show.\n\n\nBut unfortunately, the show has its share of problems as well. While the portrayal of high school life and relationships is humorous and endearing, it is lacking in production quality without particularly good animation, soundtrack quality or VA work.\n\n\nWorse is the impact the disjointed narrative has on the pacing of the season. The majority of the episodes take place “in between” the episodes of Season 1, existing more as side stories. In one sense this structure allows for the exploration of different character dynamics and group interactions, giving the show a good amount of variety. But unfortunately the show's chronologically disjointed narrative lacks the impactful elements of the first season and can occasionally come across as downright confusing with episodes jumping around chronologically. Sometimes it goes from a scene where characters have not met each other to one where they are already friends but the initial interaction happened in the first season. But despite the unexceptional production elements and structural issues result in a show, the great character interactions makes for an enjoyable show.\n",

          "writeup": "Spinning off from the main series, this season of *Konosuba* features Megumin with an almost entirely new cast of characters around her. While it might not live up to the original, it still provides more of the same greatness you'd expect, along with some new faces and welcome insight into familiar ones.\n\n\nWith Yunyun always there to bail her out, Megumin is given a large amount of freedom to run wild. The Crimson Demon school does nothing but encourage her ridiculous chuuni antics while the adventuring world does nothing but shun them, shaping the character we already knew. Alongside her, Yunyun shines as a secondary star that grows out of her shell, Komekko provides some wholesome family moments, while Cecily and Bukkorori snap us back to the series' expected pervy gags. \n\n\nUnfortunately even though Megumin's interactions with the cast are good, you still miss those that she had with the Kazuma, Aqua, and Darkness, and are left feeling a bit wanting. What does carry over however is the production. Great reaction faces and excellent VA work from the main duo help sell the absurdity of the situations they find themselves in, and some surprising animation highlights the few action scenes the show offers\n\n\nIt's a must-watch for anybody who is a fan of Megumin, and overall one of the better comedies to come out this year.\n",

          "writeup": "Isekai Ojisan is largely driven by the titular Uncle character. Uncle is defined by a critical lack of genre savviness in a trope-filled fantasy world, a persistent pessimism driven by his constant mistreatment, as well as a lack of social tact. This combination of traits cause him to consistently make the worst out of any situation and subvert many isekai tropes by fumbling his way around them. Uncle is an absolute riot of a character and easily the lion's share of that comic energy comes from Takehito Koyasu doing a killer job with his intensely visceral performance.\n\n\nThe side characters are also big standouts. Most notably is \"Elf\", a prickly tsundere, whose temperamental affections are mistaken as genuine hostility. This comedic bit is consistently hilarious in part due to the escalating absurdity of Uncle's misunderstandings. Contrasting the fantasy world with Uncle and Takafumi's exploits in the real world using Uncle's retained powers keeps the show entertaining as it switches between the two settings. Takafumi's mutually unacknowledged feelings for his childhood friend Sumika parallel Uncle and Elf's relationship, allowing comedic yet thoughtful exploration of how self-doubt can hamper perceived undeservingness of love.\n\n\nMuch of Isekai Ojisan humor is driven by a juxtaposition of its characters' wildly differing perspectives. Through these characters it perfectly mixes its absurd comedy with a compelling exploration of relationships and human connections.\n",

          "writeup": "Breaking apart from its polarizing genre, *The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You* offers a look at the wacky antics that occur when an ever-increasing group of eccentric girls dote over the male protagonist and offers plenty of entertainment.\n\n\nThe show starts off in relatively grounded territory. In addition to a Love God blessing and cursing the protagonist Rentaro with 100 soul mates, the story is mainly a typical high school romance centered on finding the perfect gifts and mastering the first kiss. As the formula of Rentaro meeting a girl, feeling sparks, and convincing her to join his harem becomes routine, the show escalates into utter absurdity. By the season's end, anything goes.\n\n\nWhat really makes *100 Girlfriends* stand out from its genre peers is how it embraces and exaggerates the concept. Rentaro *will* end up with all the girls. This isn't a competition to see which girl ends up with the boy so all the girls get time to shine. However, much like the premise of the show, the reliance on meta humor is both a blessing and a curse, as the show falls into the trap of its own parody. The overly referential jokes occasionally overstay their welcome, and its increasing self-awareness has the tendency to turn its finetuned gags into a redundant glut.\n\n\nStill, *100 Girlfriends* is a refreshing and well-executed take on the genre and results in a solid harem comedy that earn it a place in the top comedies of 2023.",

That said, the larger narrative focus in the Cruise arc is a welcome breeze of fresh air, adding a much needed shake up from the previous season.\n\n\nThis season uses the strengths of its characters and family dynamic more consistently. Anya continues to be fantastic, with her comedic interactions and schemes being a highlight during the Cruise arc. That said, her school skits ran their course at this point and are starting to wear thin. Yor is given much needed screen time, with a welcome exploration of her character and occupation. Loid has a more passive role but continues his growth as a caring parent and partner, while also being a fun contrast to Anya's childishness. However, skits with side characters such as Bond, Damian or Yuri  often miss and are low points of the season.\n\n\nThe series maintains its solid production quality, delivering visually appealing scenes, fun character expressions, where Anya is again the highlight, and excellent action sequences with Yor.\n\n\nUltimately, *Spy x Family Season 2* continues to be a fun and entertaining series with a strong focus on family dynamics and character interactions, resulting in one of the stronger comedies of the year.\n",

Whether it’s becoming a daddy with your buddy, growing up as the child of your oshi, or racing Narita Top Road to the top, these anime are defined by endearing casts winding through their highs and lows. In the nomination phase, the jury shortlisted almost twenty shows, with few seemingly locked in. Among others, entries like Blue Giant, Hibike Euphonium, and Phoenix: Eden17 were in contention until the very last nomination vote.  The resulting eight nominated dramas seem quite different on the surface. Thorfinn, for instance, struggles with pacifism while Aqua navigates the cutthroat entertainment industry. Minato learns to work with his team, Tomori tries to keep a band together, and Fushi defends humanity. For some, the stakes are life and death; for others, it is simply self-improvement at sports. Even so, when following a character whom you want to see succeed, whose struggles feel personal and meaningful, conflicts large and small alike become exciting to watch unfold.  When you think about it that way, structurally what is the difference between Road to the Top and World Dai Star? Or Vinland Saga and Oshi no Ko? At the end of the day, it's all about characters we can empathize with overcoming hardships and forging new connections. These eight drama shows of 2023 stand out as exemplary demonstrations of both.",

The show does a wonderful job exploring this dynamic, highlighting the characters' realization that, even as they compete for roles, they cannot reach the top on their own.\n\n\nThere is a twist in this tale though for the characters are endowed with superpowers that lends intrigue to the show. This is particularly prevalent in Kokona's arc, leading to its emotional climax that is cleverly signposted both narratively and visually. However, other characters' powers were unfortunately less fleshed out.\n\n\nA play is nothing without its supporting cast though, and here Kathrina stands out, captivating and commanding the audience. The rest of the cast have plenty of time to shine; however, some characters who receive less spotlight, like Chisa, are noticeably weaker.\n\n\nThe performances themselves feature strong cinematography, music, and voice acting, with the final act combining all of these elements into one show-stopper finale—including an impressive display of animation on the 1s. However, once the characters are offstage, the production's shortcomings become evident in its subpar animation and simple backgrounds. Despite this, its cinematography remains a beacon, with significant motif usage, creative blocking, and diligent layouts highlighting the strength of its characters behind the curtain.\n\n\nWhile some of its aspects are a mixed bag, *World Dai Star* is both a delightful showcase of musical theater and a compelling character drama.",

Ryohei and Shuu's new bond stands out in particular, as well as the added characterization for the Kirisaki team as a whole. While the antagonist Nikaido can come across as overly edgy, he cuts a flawed and compelling figure who also functions as an interesting counterpart to Masa. On the downside, while it is good to see the girls on the team get more dedicated focus, they could still be better integrated into the overall narrative of the show.  \n \n\nAs is their habit, Kyoto Animation delivered one of the finest overall productions of the year.

          "writeup": "Though the first season of *Fumetsu* was a gripping series of emotionally impactful arcs where the main character, Fushi, would meet new people and gradually learn about being human, the second season takes a markedly different direction. Instead of comprising a series of arcs following different people, the entire season is a long arc following the same characters and developing the world around them. While this sacrifices much of the emotional impact of the first season, it allows for the exploration of more complex topics and stories, like Fushi's struggles with love and morality. New characters like Bon and Kohaku have the space to develop gradually and have more compelling character arcs. The world itself is expanded with a new political lean and exploration of the series' metaphysical aspects.\n\n\nHowever, while this new style of storytelling has its merits, not all of it was particularly well executed, and the series still suffers from overall poor production. Much like with the story, the second season of *Fumetsu* certainly tries new visual elements, but they are rarely successful. The cinematography is often comically bizarre, the composition of visual effects is distracting, and the animation is seldom present. In terms of the writing, most of the side characters become lost in the crowd and remain thoroughly undeveloped, with the exception of the two main leads, Bon and Fushi.The plot itself is stretched out far too much, losing focus and becoming repetitive towards the end, which leaves much of the world-building half-baked. \n\n\n*Fumetsu no Anata e Season 2* makes a bold attempt to be different but ultimately ends up falling short of its ambition.",

The show flourishes with its lighting, cleverly employing shadows to display Soyo's manipulation or Taki's regret. Characters are astutely blocked, visualizing separation and division, and reflect the communication struggles plaguing these characters.\n\n\nAll of this culminates into some of the best dramatic storylines of the year, as the characters and their flaws come to a collision, creating emotional highlights and top-notch moments, fitting for the best drama of 2023.",

          "writeup": "Taking the world by storm, *Oshi no Ko* was a shoo-in for nomination, as it explores the seedy underbelly present in a world of glamor. The dual plotlines of mystery and show business lure the viewer in right away, with bold twists pulling them along and cliffhangers never overextending their welcome. And yet, there is a definite subtlety and attention to detail, where each medium of entertainment is given proper care, from the reality of a dating show to the nuances of each character reflecting on their performance.The visuals also complement this riveting journey, where the pairing of memorable character designs and clever cinematography tricks make this series a technical triumph.\n\n\nThere are, however, a few flaws that prevented this anime from placing higher, and none moreso than the cast. While Kana was a distinct favorite among everyone at the awards, Aqua was portrayed as an uninteresting plot vessel of a brooding protagonist who often takes importance more than he needs. Ruby, too, was often criticized for her lack of screentime, and Akane's arc, though brilliantly atmospheric, failed to deliver a satisfying payoff for her character. \n\n\nAdditionally, the exploration of the \"dark side of the entertainment industry\" is left without a conclusion. While this ambiguity serves as a tool for intrigue, *Oshi no Ko* does not leverage its typically strong decision-making to convey a broader message, choosing instead to simply present the truth as it stands. Still, *Oshi no Ko* more than earns its place at this table with its captivating twists and turns.",

          "writeup": "Following up on the historical revenge tale of the series' prior entry, *Vinland Saga Season 2* moves away from the front lines to present an introspective narrative centered on the series protagonist Thorfinn's life as a farm slave years later. It excels at showing the costs of the violent viking culture by highlighting the stories of those who suffered under it.\n\n\nWhether it's the enslavement of Einar and Arnheid or Thorfinn's struggle to confront his past sins, Vinland Saga S2 crafts gripping character drama that treats its sensitive subject matter with the tact and seriousness it deserves. Yet it doesn't fall into grimdark territory either. The trauma from past atrocities, the horrors of slavery, and the bleakness of its setting are contrasted with ambitions for a more peaceful world through the ideologies represented by Thorfinn and Canute.\n\n\nThough narratively rich, the animation unfortunately often comes off as stiff and unemotive, which puts a damper on the overall experience. As a result of this shortcoming, the scenes can often feel flat when the storyboarding turns to close-ups. Other aspects of the production, such as the backgrounds and soundtrack, however, leave a positive impression.\n\n\n*Vinland Saga S2* sets itself apart from the previous season, both stylistically and thematically through its emphasis on ideals for improving society and anti-war messaging. Despite not being among the top of the category production-wise, this show proves itself to be a worthwhile and well-written slow-burn drama.",

        "blurb": "In contrast to the quirky rom-com nominees of last year, the nominees this year focused much more strongly on dramatic storytelling elements. Visual presentation elements vary greatly amongst the nominees, but each have their own key theme aiding their selection. From dazzling starscapes in *Insomniacs* to striking cinematography with *Yamada-999* to the somber and reflective lighting of *WataKon*, visuals play a significant dramatic role in each of the shows. This is also true for the only sequel among the nominees, *Kaguya-sama* movie, as the exploration of Kaguya and Shirogane’ vulnerabilities diverges from strongly comedic foundations of the series while retaining its phenomenal animated flair.     Other romantic explorations unfortunately fell through the gaps with limited nominations. For lighthearted and tender romances such as *Tonikaku Kawaii Season 2*, *Kubo-san wa Mob wo Yurusanai*, *Horimiya: pieces*, and *Shiro Seijo to Kuro Bokushi*, it was hard to find common ground on the shows that ultimately succeeded to resonate with the heart. Another notable omission is the sequel to the 2021 Romance genre winner in *Shinigami Bocchan Season 2* which struggles to find a good balance with its slice of life and drama.   Whether you prefer fantasy settings, classic shoujo storylines, or heartful romances, the nominations this year are excellent watchlist additions. ",

Saraphi's optimism creates a strong foil to the more pessimistic and beat-down folks that surround her.\n\n\nThe series' strongest point is how it shows the themes of empathy and kindness in the face of prejudice and how the latter affects and hurts everyone. The impacts on character's lives when shoved into boxes is well explored and will resonate with most viewers.\n\n\nHowever, the show is mixed with its visuals. While it does display the desolation of its world well, it looks dull due to the oversaturation of brown hues and its weakness in cinematography due to its lack of creativity or depth in it. While the strongest story beats hit hard because of how well they're mixed into the themes, others can end up feeling repetitive due to overutilizing the same plot-beats, such as Saraphi essentially saving everyone. Despite that, it's able to give a strong heartwarming message by showing how its cast changes for the better when they're given a chance and are treated with respect, giving a strong thematic message towards equality and optimism.",

          "writeup": "*Watashi no Yuri wa Oshigoto Desu!* is an excellent exploration into the flaws of its cast. It juggles such themes as deceit, the need for attention, isolation, and possessiveness. This is aided by clever use of blocking shots, contrasting lighting, and smart composition to hint at characters' true motives and feelings - such as Hinako's isolation through her love of dark spaces or Hime's duplicity via wide symmetrical shots. The characters subvert usual genre tropes and offer a fresh take on their archetypes, from Hime's cute girl act to gyaru Tachibana's book smarts. In addition, the show offers meta-commentary regarding the Class S sisterly relationships; these sisterly roles are both freeing and limiting when it comes to expressing queer affection.\n\n\nUnfortunately, the cast and drama are divisive. While each character's flaws add a degree of relatability to the cast, they can also make the characters too unlikable. The drama unfolds slowly, and this gives ample time to flesh out character motives, but the progression can feel tedious. Other than expressive character animation and the aforementioned visual direction, the production values are average.\n\n\nLove it or hate it, *Watashi no Yuri* is sure to leave a strong impression on its audience. It deservingly earns its place among the best romance anime of the year.",

          "writeup": "*Natsu e no Tunnel, Sayonara no Deguchi* beautifully conveys the struggles of two individuals finding solace in each other. With extensively witty dialogue, a subtle yet strong central relationship, and wonderful atmosphere, the movie is an exemplar of efficient storytelling in how it conveys the realistic struggles and family life of the protagonists Kaoru and Anzu. Solidarity arises naturally between them, their chemistry being superbly written. The supernatural is then deftly placed within this drama. The titular tunnel is a conduit for some of the strongest character interactions, turning it uniquely interesting and thematically powerful.\n\n\nUnfortunately, this is a rather limited film. These mere 90 minutes cannot hope to capture the ambition and grandeur that is attempted. Anzu and Kaoru are wonderful, but they are alone in the cast, as others are relegated to only a few lines of dialogue. There is simply no time to spend with anyone else, even as they fuel conflict. The central duo begins to collapse under that weight. As the movie moves into its conclusion, it makes large, sweeping moves and boldly romantic gestures it has not earned, and ends before it has the chance to explore any consequences of this. Many viewers will leave with a bitter aftertaste, a thought of “That's it?” spoiling an otherwise astonishingly relatable movie. Overall, *Natsu e no Tunnel, Sayonara no Deguchi* is an experience worth having, but it fails to truly go to the next level.",

Despite not reinventing the wheel narratively, the cinematography, voice acting, and music do a great job at selling the setting and the emotional tolls it has on the cast. Miyo and Kiyoka do not get their happily ever after handed to them. Instead, the audience gets an emotionally gripping tale that is as captivating as it is emotional. Despite the simple premise, everything is executed so well that *WataKon* is given all the ingredients for great success.\n\n\nThis success comes through in the first half at least, but the continuation of a story that felt conclusive leads to a series of contrivances that both feels very forced as well as undermines much of what came before it. What starts as a relatable and gripping story devolves into melodrama and mixed messages. While it sticks the landing, by that time the sharp drop in quality has already had an impact.\n\n\n*WataKon* is a series of highs and lows, but it cannot be overstated how amazing the show is when it hits. In sickness and in health, *Watashi no Shiawase na Kekkon* is an unforgettable experience that is well worth a watch.",

The core of the show looks at the growing bonds within her MMO guild, particularly through their time spent together in-person, and by broadening personal boundaries. \n\n\nSupported by her online MMO guild in-game and in-person, the show employs marvelous cinematic scene compositions to detail the changes in her friendships alongside the cast's inner monologues. Partial body shots that conceal feelings to demonstrate the self-protective hiding of details, transparent silhouettes on colorful vignettes to let the audience see through the character's facades, and playful chibi interjections to break down dramatic tension are all generously utilized with appropriate timing. \n\n\n*Yamada-999* presents a different angle of romance, emphasizing how true emotional connection stems from the personal growth of individuals, cultivated independently rather than through direct romantic interactions. Though unique in exploration, this has mixed success as the lack of a charismatic connection between Akane's bubbly character and the docile reactions of Yamada occasionally fails to draw the audience in—even with the aid of cinematic tools providing glimpses into their unspoken or misunderstood feelings. Though few, there are additionally confusing moments of melodrama that distract from the primary relational development, but add to the quintessentially shoujo narrative. \n\n\n*Yamada-999* is a visual treat, and great food for the soul in the way it expresses handling heartbreak.

Our leads find an amazing solidarity in a shared struggle for instant relatable chemistry, but the merits of the series extends beyond the main couple. Each member of the cast adds their own spark, a necessary little push for the central pair to evolve, feeling rich and full of life in their own right as they inhabit this fleshed-out world. The male lead of Ganta in particular has a brilliant arc stemming from these relationships, as he becomes someone truly worth rooting for after a somewhat rocky introduction. The evocative premise allows the background artists to show off, with shimmering starscapes capturing the wonder of the night in ways few other anime can do. This compliments the slower pacing, though it is not to be said *Insomniac* lacks momentum; it simply knows how to bask in the quiet moments, and how to accurately appreciate the art of astronomy when exploring it. Indeed, only the highest of recommendations can be given to this year's jury winner. ",

Ichikawa is as earnest as he is awkward, and Yamada is carefree but surprisingly attentive. Taking place in middle school with puberty in full swing, it can be awkward for many of the interactions present between the two of them. Combining the bashful commutation with the heartfelt feelings present between the two leads creates a charming dynamic and touching character interactions. It's hard not to be enamored seeing moments like Ichikawa throwing his bike into a river to stop someone hitting on Yamada, realizing how stupid this was afterwards. With creative storyboarding and a soulful OST on top of it, *BokuYaba* is a captivating show for sure. \n\n\nDespite these strengths, there are things that hold the show back. The most noteworthy being the rough start, with Ichikawa and his classmates initially coming off as unlikable edge-lords or perverts for several episodes. Middle school blunder years are in full force here, and that comes with its annoyances along with its charm. The school setting is also on the basic side, making it even harder to continue through its rougher portions.\n\n\nIt does like to take its time, but by the end it is clear that *Boku no Kokoro no Yabai Yatsu* is a well-executed show that earns a spot in the top five of the year.",

Ice Kaguya's presence in this show results in the relationship resetting to its state prior to the confession, and while this arc ends in a satisfying way it also takes away from the emotional impact felt from the previous confession that the show has been building up towards.\n\n\nWhile the show stumbles a bit in its execution of its ideas and messages, the character development alongside the superb visuals and vocal performances results in another fantastic entry in the *Kaguya-sama* series that fans will be satisfied with.",

Kitasan's charming personality and the emotional trials she faces endear her to the audience, fostering great investment in her career. Side characters also undergo compelling narrative arcs, such as Satono Diamond's quest to become the first member of her clan to win a major race, or Nice Nature's struggles with feelings of inadequacy as she attempts to be a mentor and a pillar of emotional support to Kitasan. These dramatic storylines are balanced with quirky comedy, skillfully using each character's unique personality to further connect with the audience.\n\n\nHowever, the show is not without its issues. The supporting cast is too large, resulting in several  characters receiving inadequate attention and development, leaving them tangential to the main story. Additionally, the final arc's central theme of coming to terms with athletic decline is undermined by the inherent absence of linear time in the world of Uma Musume.\n\n\nNevertheless, *Uma Musume: Pretty Derby Season 3*'s gripping story and compelling characters make it another worthwhile watch and one deserving of its place among this year's nominees.",

          "writeup": "*Hoshikuzu Telepath* shoots for the stars in its coming of age story about the gloomy Umika Konohoshi finding a place she can belong and feel free from her earthly troubles.\n\n\nPlenty of shows have featured protagonists with communication disorders or social anxiety, yet compared to them Umika develops into a more self-confident leader to a much more noticeable degree. This is with the help of her friends who also face their own troubles and improve themselves in a similar way. These noticeable changes keep the series feeling fresh, even as new challenges set some characters back to square one for short bursts of time.\n\n\nThe prominent character growths are not crowded together however, and the show breaks up the dramatic beats to give them room to breathe with the inclusion of many laid-back and comedic scenes, punctuated by vibrant colors and backgrounds that pop with contrast. It's an art style that accentuates character expression and reaction faces, fostering a contagiously fun and positive atmosphere that elevates the otherwise standard dialogue and comedic moments employed.\n\n\nThis visual style and atmosphere also makes it easier to attach to the cast from the beginning, making them very endearing. Although one character stands out in how little they are explored within the show's runtime, everyone else feels well developed and very different from how they started. A lovely cast coupled with its pleasant mix of character development and comedy makes *Hoshikuzu Telepath* one of the top Slice of Life anime of the year.",

Euphonium*, following Kumiko Oumae as she transitions from ambitious club member to club president. This OVA leaves behind much of the heavier drama characteristic of the main series as Kumiko's involvement in the personal hang-ups of the other band members no longer takes center stage. Instead, focus is shifted towards the responsibility of her new role, as well as the change in mindset she experiences as she adapts. The OVA also brings to the table some of the best production of the year, with subtle and expressive character animation, another outstanding voice performance from Tomoyo Kurosawa, and detailed backgrounds. \n\n\nSince this OVA acts as a prologue to the upcoming 3rd Season, it spends time introducing more new cast members, giving perspective on Kumiko's dilemma of being responsible for these various band members. However, this approach results in a somewhat drawn-out and anti-climactic ending sequence, which serves more to set up future events than to satisfactorily conclude this story. Even with Kumiko's intriguing character study, the consistently slower pace became somewhat monotonous.\n\n\nNonetheless, *Tokubetsu-hen Hibike! Euphonium: Ensemble Contest* succeeds in setting up Kumiko's character and story for the next chapter of *Hibike! Euphonium* while keeping audiences engaged with the character study and band dynamics, earning it a place on the podium.",

          "writeup": "*Dekiru Neko wa Kyou mo Yuuutsu* is a heartwarming tale of Saku and her cat, Yukichi, who helps her out with housework and daily responsibilities. It succeeds in being a comforting series and the pairing of a lazy and diligent character is a classic recipe for success. Things work even better when the diligent one is a cat, flipping the trope of the lazy cat tended to by their master on its head. \n\n\nSaku embodies the lax but competent mess that so many of us can be. Her reactions and general demeanor are humorous, providing many of the show's highlights. Yukichi himself delivers cute moments with his unamused reactions to Saku's antics and listless personality, as well as gap moe when he wants something but doesn't want to show it. The two's bond and backstory is excellently explored, giving value to their relationship, illustrating why Yukichi cares so much about his supposedly “pitiful” master, and exploring the compelling message that to be loved is to be changed.\n\n\nWhile its characters are strong, the visual production is a notable weakness to the show. Camera angles, while unique, often feel off-putting and odd elements that don't fit well together are put in focus. Additionally, shots are reused with notable frequency causing it to feel stilted, negatively influencing the pacing. Despite these visual shortcomings, the bond between the cat and master is still compelling, and the show's cuteness and comedy makes *Dekiru Neko wa Kyou mo Yuuutsu* a fun watch.\n",

The show starts off much like many other isekai, with the former salaryman Mukouda being summoned as a hero to a fantasy realm. However, upon discovering his only unique skill is ordering products from a Japanese supermarket, he decides to leave his heroic duties behind and enjoy a peaceful life of cooking and traveling in this new world.\n\n\nThe dynamic between Mukouda and his familiars, Fel the imposing wolf and Sui the adorable slime, stands out as the strongest aspect of the show. Fel's role as tough love mentor and a glutton who constantly pressures Mukouda for second servings is both endearing and hilarious, and the mid-season introduction of Sui adds even more liveliness. The growing relationship between the three is endearing to watch, and the banter remains consistently funny. \n\n\nHowever, the show does little to build upon this foundation. None of the side characters, monsters, or locations Mukouda encounters during his travels are novel or developed enough to contribute significantly to the show. Consequently, the fantasy setting is disappointingly overlooked and often appears as an afterthought used to justify Mukouda's monster companions. The production is also unimpressive, doing little to enhance the show's setting, aside from the vibrant color palette helping to create a lighthearted atmosphere.\n\n\nAlthough these shortcomings prevent a fully immersive experience, *Hourou Meshi* works as a comfort food anime that stays enjoyable to watch throughout.",

Mahiro's rehabilitation from their NEET lifestyle, personal growth, and journey to living a happy life provide some of the best feel-good material from this year.Becoming more comfortable with feminine self-expression and beginning to connect with others—these serve as fantastic character arcs to follow, ones which keeps things light while also packing an emotional punch. The rest of the cast, too, all feel well fleshed out, with each character expressing themselves in unique ways, making them feel more human even amidst the occasional absurd comedy.\n\n\nUnfortunately, the show becomes somewhat controversial when considering both its premise and its ecchi. The lack of consent in Mahiro's initial transformation into a girl is certainly problematic. Mahiro's age regression also presents elements which leave a bad taste when you consider they are an adult now going to school as a middle school girl. This paired with the ecchi nature of its comedy and its occasional voyeuristic cinematography makes for a poor mix.\n\n\nDespite this, *Onimai* excels through expressive and varied character design, a vibrant and energetic cast, exceptional voice acting performances, a moving OST, and possibly the best animation of a TV anime this year, making every moment count and establishing it as one of the best slice-of-life series this year.",

Her lack of social experience and straightforward drive to improve act as interesting and amusing quirks, which endear her to both the audience and her classmates.\n\n\nThe story portrays a realistic portrayal of human struggles as Mitsumi and friends navigate high school and their teenage years. Thanks to solid character writing and natural feeling dialogue, *Skip to Loafer*is able to resolve conflicts in a civilized manner without jarring melodrama, and is one of the biggest highlights to be praised.\n\n\nAn outlier of this aspect however, are the final episodes involving Shima and Ririka. Their relationship sticks out due to not fitting the fuzzy atmosphere of the rest of the show. While this spotlight allows Shima to move forward past his trauma, it does so awkwardly with less convincing character writing and farcical dialogue.\n\n\nAs for the production, the art direction and cinematography are well-crafted, the bright pastel colors contrast the mundanity of daily life, emphasizing the show's general themes of healthy friendships fostering continuous positivity.\n\n\n*Skip to Loafer* is a great comfort show and one of the better slice of life of the year with a likable cast, positive character development, and skillful handling of interpersonal dynamics.\n",

There is a very noticeable overarching theme of mystery and detective work for most series that came out this year, from the classical literature present in “Undead Girl Murder Farce” to the futuristic themes of “Pluto”. Over half of the shows nominated this year focus on detective work in some fashion, making a clear case that this is the year of the sleuth.   Detective work may have taken front and center stage for most of these entries, but there was a distinct note of heavy horror tones in many of the series that made it in as well. “Dark Gathering” gave us new levels of fear seeing the unknown, and “Tengoku Daimakyou” keeps the tension thick as the main characters struggle for survival in a broken world. There was heated discussion about this year’s nominees, and consensus was hard to reach on which shows were better than the others, a great indicator of the quality this year had to offer. Points brought up went far into depth of setting and design, and even then there was no certain victor between the competition. A year certainly to be remembered in the genre of suspense, and one we may see more of if these contenders continue on in the future.",

          "writeup": "The second season of *Kyokou Suiri* improves on the foundation laid by the previous instance. Instead of focusing on a single, very long arc, it features a bunch of short stories.  While still dialogue-heavy, the large variety of stories and characters doesn't let the formula get boring. It also helps showcasing different sides of the main characters. For example, by putting Iwanaga in various situations, it presents her as cunning, witty, vulgar, fearless, and even intimidating. Her charisma and shenanigans end up being a huge appeal of the show. The same can be said about Yuki-Onna's charm and the relationship she has with Masayuki.\n\n\nThe aspect that is lacking the most is the visuals. Even though it can be praised for the character designs, and there's merit to be found in the use of colors, cinematography is often pretty boring. In addition to that, the animation is also not particularly noteworthy and the backgrounds could use some work. Stronger visuals would complement the wordy conversations by providing concurrent entertainment.\n\n\nSome of the arcs are not as strong as others, with Yuki-Onna and Sleeping Murder arcs being the best by a large margin. Nonetheless, *Kyokou Suiri* is a solid package. Fabricating truth is a pretty novel approach to writing detective mysteries. Combining it with different stories focusing on different characters in addition to having creative premises and varied goals for the characters prevents this series from falling short where detective stories often do - by becoming too formulaic.",

          "writeup": "*Migi to Dali* follows the lives of orphaned twins as they get adopted into a childless family. However, there's more going on with the boys and their backgrounds than initially meets the eye.\n\n\nOne of the greatest strengths of *Migi to Dali* is how it weaves different genres and themes into a whole while remaining balanced and well-paced. It's hilarious and to the point as a comedy, yet it manages to deliver its emotional and dramatic climax to a multi-layered mystery, enhanced by a retro art style. The first few episodes of the series may feel a bit excessive as they are not directly relevant to the plot, but they are crucial in laying the groundwork for it while introducing the supporting cast that plays a vital role during the later parts, as well as making the audience acquainted with the bizarre comedic approach of the series that combines over-the-top visual jokes with perfect animation choices.\n\n\nGoing further into the series, the characterization comes into the spotlight, especially with the main duo. Migi and Dali, who perceived themselves as a single entity, begin acting more distinctively as the story continues on a more serious note. This makes the story unpredictable yet engaging and is critical for its satisfactory ending. Considering the boys were never as similar as they thought, It's not far-fetched to assume that the story is recounted from the twin's perspective.\n\n\nOverall, *Migi to Dali* is a fulfilling watching experience, from vivacious comedy and a colorful cast to a layered mystery with a deranged villain, it has something to offer for everyone's taste.",

Combining elements of Japanese folklore with the darker tendencies of modern society, the origins and visual designs of the spirits are as creative as their abilities. \n\n\nCoupled with the encounter-specific gimmicks, Dark Gathering's unique spirit versus spirit setup makes for an interesting watch even for those not fond of horror. The focus remains squarely on identifying the spirits' strengths and weaknesses, and exploiting the rules they're necessarily bound by as a trade-off for being allowed to exist.\n\n\nUnfortunately the tension in the encounters evaporates during the later parts, with the main trio's triumph seeming more or less assured thanks to the show's repetitive structure. Keitaro, Eiko and Yayoi aren't particularly complex characters, and the slice-of-life moments end up being hit or miss. The show's insistence on always establishing precise objectives does give it a degree of momentum, yet by the end there's very little in the way of meaningful narrative progress, although it does wrap up the journey to a climactic encounter.\n\n\n*Dark Gathering* remains a solid entry in the niche genre of horror anime, being an enjoyable watch throughout its runtime and setting the stage for a promising sequel.",

Having a Japanese cast in a decidedly European setting is certainly uncommon for this genre, and what helps make this shine is the fact that the main trio themselves are foreign monsters.This odd group evokes reasonable and expected reactions from those that hate monsters and those who are monsters themselves.\n\n\nThis series features an array of characters that appear within classical literature, from Sherlock Holmes and Moriarty, to Arsene Lupin and the Phantom of the Opera. It utilizes these characters in a very unique way, giving them abilities that allow them to stand equal amongst the actual monsters of the cast. When discussing the cast, the chemistry of the two main characters can't be understated, as they bring a very fun banter to the series that helps to keep the mood lighter at times, and is never quite out of place, despite being within a mystery series.\n\n\nThis series has a few issues with pacing out the introduction of new cast, and making some arcs longer or potentially ongoing when they could have been self-contained. This is balanced out quite well by the handling of the cast, and having a pace of storytelling that is gripping and tense. Hopefully future seasons will see this great start bear fruit.",

The show never shying away from killing off its characters lends weight to the fights, and its enigmatic villains and bizarre creatures creates a precarious atmosphere.  The pace at which details about the island are uncovered along with the creative power system makes for a gripping main story.\n\n\nDespite being enjoyable, inconsistent visuals hold the show back compared to other action-focused titles. For every well-framed and directed shot there's a decent number of bland ones, with an over reliance on slow motion and camera movement to disguise choppy character animation.\n\n\nThe frequent deaths are a double-edged sword, as they lead to some interesting characters that never get the opportunity to be fleshed out. Although Gabimaru and Sagiri do make for an enjoyable pair, most characters outside the main duo fail to be memorable. Gabimaru himself can be rather one-note until the later stages of the show, but his changing relationship with Sagiri makes up for his flat personality, with Sagiri herself getting an admirable degree of development. \n\n\nAside from a few missteps, *Jigokuraku*'s mythological spin on the survival-focused narrative ensures a thrilling watch throughout its runtime.

It extensively explores the psyche of robots as sentient beings and contrasts this with what the show considers more ‘human' emotions like love, happiness, anger or sorrow. \n\n\nHatred, the most visceral of all emotions, becomes the driving force for a mysterious threat that sets out for revenge against the seven strongest robots and their creators. The series uses the mystery surrounding the serial murder of several important robots and scholars to explore the origin of said hatred and connects it to a massive war involving these seven robots, the perception of whether they actually fought for a righteous cause, and the remaining scars it left with its soldiers and victims. Here, the audience is invited to delve not only the clues that are given on the culprit's identity, but also on their motivations, as well as how the would-be victims deal with what seems to be a ghost from the past looking for vengeance. \n\n\nIt is within this story that the series is able to develop its rich characters. The aftermath of the war lays a foundation for exploring these characters and how they each seek to atone in their own way for their involvement in the war. It also invites the viewer to look beyond mere hatred and understand the sadness and remorse behind their actions, as it goes through a journey in which these characters break away from the pain that shackled them to the past while cherishing the joys they strived for. It is through this introspective approach that this show manages to go beyond its premise as a futuristic detective thriller and turns it into a compelling story of forgiveness and overcoming hatred.",

When paired with Hiroyuki Sawano's intense soundtrack, it gets the blood pumping. One of the more notable examples is the battle against the past generations of titans. Just seeing their designs and fighting styles makes for a great spectacle. Even outside of the action scenes, there are visually pleasing shots like spring on Paradis island or the mainland after the passing of the rumbling.\n\n\nPartially as a consequence of decisions made in previous instances, *AoT* stumbles in the writing department. The reveal of Ymir's motivation for her obeying king Fritz was questionable, as it was contradictory with her past characterization. Historia's plot-line suggests there was a twist planned that later got abandoned. Furthermore, some of the dialogue was off, for example the infamous ‘ten years' line. Finally, Eren's actions were confusing and disappointing. Some of the sacrifices made felt unnecessary and inconsistent with his motives. Justifying his behavior with being unable to change the future is not convincing.\n\n\nIn spite of its flaws, Attack on Titan remains a compelling watch throughout its final installment. Watching titans duke it out is simply entertaining, while the story presents some interesting ideas like the final conversations Eren has with his friends.",

          "writeup": "Civilization has nearly vanished, and everyone is fighting tooth and nail to survive in the aftermath of the disaster. *Tengoku Daimakyou*  investigates the origins of this post-apocalyptic world by following two seemingly independent storylines.\n\n\nThe dominant storyline, which is focused on two teenagers as they travel in this world, enjoys the benefits of a great production. Detailed backgrounds with vibrant colors, careful framing, and the ambient soundtrack all work together to capture the essence of this post-apocalyptic world. Kiruko and Maru have great chemistry on screen as the main duo. The other storyline is focused on the events happening in a closed facility and naturally has less production versatility. The series could also flesh out the facility story a bit more since it remained rather fuzzy for most of the running time.\n\n\nOne of the notable features of *Tengoku Daimakyou* is its creative narrative. The two storylines are woven and connected in a way that keeps the audience guessing about the bigger plot and the nature of this world. The relationship between these two parts becomes clear by the end of the season, but ultimately many other questions are left unresolved. The big reveal at the end is somewhat predictable, and there are also some controversial explicit scenes throughout the series that inflict tonal whiplash, while their relativity to the main plot is questionable.\n\n\nDespite some peculiarities with its story, *Tengoku Daimakyou* is an enjoyable watch that benefits from great production quality.",

        "blurb": "The dramatic characters of the 2023 r/Anime Awards are those which captivated emotions and imaginations. Their stories liberally explore the things which make us who we are, and the decisions that we make or choose to ignore in the face of challenge.  A key point of contrast which is apparent between each of the nominees is the approach of their shows in balancing their thematic and narrative relevance. The jury valued characters which had consistent messaging in these areas, where character threads made sense independently and for the works as a whole. For this matter, characters like Thorfinn and Shima were highly appraised: Thorfinn’s journey of redemption and pursuit of peace becoming clear in his personal experience of being a slave in two regards - first to his own hatred and then in a more literal sense; and Shima’s tendency of hiding himself away from relationship for fear of feeling worth after troubling events in his past, to then find a new outlook on the ways he can live his life. Similar structures can be found with the other nominees as they each grappled with a fundamental theme true with their characters, not the least of which including: justice, identity, anxiety, anger, pride, and self-worth.    The main takeaways from our nomination slate this year are the powerful parallels in these characters figuring out what it means to be themselves, as viewers are invited to do the same through their experiences.

          "writeup": "*Tsurune: Tsunagari no Issha* expands its established cast with another figure from Minato, Seiya, and Shuu's past in the introduction of Eisuke Nikaidou. His flashy introduction to the series captures the attention of cast and audience alike, where his alternative motives in practicing kyudou for recognition provide an antagonistic position to the established understanding of the martial art. \n\n\nThe show empathetically explores Nikaidou's underpinning beliefs around kyudou linking into his formative childhood experiences with his uncle. For Nikaidou, time spent in the dojo is escapism from his rough paternal relationship, driving him to seek worth and validation through competitive success in the unique inherited form alongside upholding his adoptive father's pride. This positively and negatively cascades in his wider relationships - leadership qualities arise from his confident and prideful attitude, and airs he puts on around other teams display his hidden contempt for their lack of pride in a way that mirrors his own. However, his antagonistic role beginning with Shuu and Minato as a child is an overbearing cause for his issues persisting into high school, and his relationship with the pair similarly impacts the narrative flow. \n\n\n*Tsurune* presents the internal struggles which Nikaidou goes through this season, particularly through sophisticated imagery through cinematic angles and backgrounds. Scenes held in darkness that reflect his inner turmoil and futile struggle against the world are excellently conveyed in later developments by the imagery of colorfully painting on a blank canvas with his archery during their nationals match. The show handles its entire cast fantastically in this sequel season, with Nikaidou being of particular note.",

Exploring their rise to glory first as students together and later as soldiers, their belief structures are also firmly established in their opposing stances on war. This sets up excellently his antagonistic position to the ideals of Fukuzawa and his followers in the ADA as Fukuchi challenges them from his moral standing while also providing a convincing opponent of physical superiority. These conflicts then expand to his own followers in the Hunting Dogs, showing how in both groups conflict arises as personal beliefs are challenged in both physical and mental struggles.  \n\n\nFukuchi is undoubtedly a focal point by which the events of these seasons of BSD revolve, in his integral positioning in character drama as well as narrative significance. His superiority in tactics and might at times push the envelope too far in forming the way which conflict throughout the narrative evolves, where he is shown to either have a plan for every outcome or be able to counter any new development, but he is a compelling character throughout his time on screen.",

Despite being a little plot-convenient, his trauma, interwoven with a guilty conscience and a sense of responsibility, is too human in nature. When he encounters the concept of Formula 4, it opens a new gate for him. Madoka's passionate outlook on his newfound interest both gives him a childlike innocence and sucks the audience into the momentum of the story. It also works as a trigger for Madoka to salvage his old relationships as well as forming new ones, notably with a boy named Haruka. Their relationship is at the core of this series, as they help each other grow out of their problems. \n\n\nThe cinematic focus on Madoka's body language and gestures skillfully depicts his wide range of emotions, complementing the story and bringing the character to life. The level of expressivity he shows in different situations, specifically during his interactions with Haruka, invites the audience into an intimate understanding of his mindset and worries. In fact, it is through this expressiveness that viewers can glimpse into Madoka's past as he confronts and gradually overcomes the pit of his agony—a decisive factor that elevates him above the other characters.\n\n\nIn a story of resilience and rebuilding, Kouya Madoka emerges as a character both delicate and robust, illustrating the strength of the human spirit against overwhelming trauma.

          "writeup": "It was a pleasant surprise finding how Shima Sousuke — who first seemed an aloof, yet amenable, character serving a supporting role for the female lead — ended up becoming one of the most captivating characters of 2023, as his evolution as a person ended up becoming one of the main drivers of what makes *Skip and Loafer* such an engaging story. \n\n\nThe anime does a good job with depicting him firstly through how others perceive him, which varies heavily depending on the point of view at the moment. From a warm smile that sometimes hides bits of sadness, to a sense of kindness but with harsh words mixed in, to a talent for acting that he tends to hide alongside his past. Shima comes out through other people's lens as a mysterious person who's both considerate and distant, but for which this conception slowly changes, particularly through Mitsumi's eyes, the more they get to know each other. \n\n\nAnd it is through the later parts where the anime subtly starts changing its focus to a more introspective side of him and his own internal thoughts. Here, his self-perception shines when he unconsciously compares himself to others, from how he sympathizes with other characters when they are hurt — as he sees his past self through what they are experiencing — to unwittingly putting himself apart from those who are earnest on what they strived for and find joy through it, as he deems himself incapable of doing the same thing. It is through his character arc that he learns that he's not only inspired by the earnestness of their peers but he's also jealous of it. It is this journey in which he learns more about himself and of what he wants to do in life that makes his character arc a compelling story about self-improvement.",

The show explores this dissonance between mind and body both through serious and comedic lenses, all while not shying away from being provocative or even transgressive when dealing with said topic. Due to this, some scenes end up being  off-putting to many, but the depiction of their self-perception is undeniably emotional, introspective and thought-provoking even. \n\n\nThere is also their role as Maru's bodyguard, in which the display of wits and tenacity showcases not only how they were able to survive in this morally bankrupt, post-apocalyptic society but also gives an impression both of someone capable of outwitting dangerous people and of someone trustworthy upon whom Maru could easily rely.\n\n\nWhat is more of a mixed bag is the exploration of their flashbacks with Robin,and the sick twist that came with it, which was an impactful dramatic moment yet also felt badly handled. Add to that, the way this plays in the final episode means that it ends with said twist and not much else, thus leaving a bad aftertaste that hopefully a second season could clear out.",

Emotions like love, kindness, rage, hatred and sorrow are all displayed explicitly throughout his experiences, and the lessons he learns when he experiences them are all encompassed in one final lesson that becomes key within the story's climax, as this leaves a lasting impression not only to other characters within the story, but to the audience as well.",

It tries to explore how he faces an immense amount of mental pressure, which is a result of being suddenly left alone. The show does a good job of showing how Rudy loses all his motivation and eventually enters a state of anhedonia that takes even his greatest pleasures away from him. However, the way he constantly thinks of himself as a victim without recognizing his flaws makes the representation of his mental illness shoddy.\n\n\nRudy's romance with Sylphie is an eventuality which is taken for granted, though his somewhat brazen attitude towards other women can be a bit off-putting in this context. It's also weird how he completely forgot nearly everything about a relationship that used to be this meaningful for him.\n\n\nThe fact that Rudy is brought to a world which is too perfect for his strengths might be contradictory to the logic of him developing as a character. Such a premise, although being hopeful, can deliver a dangerous message that the fault is always with the outside. However,  the way the story constantly brings up Rudy's past self can give the audience a scale to measure how far he has come as an evolving person. It also shows that Rudeus still has a great room to grow, if the story remains eager to give him such a chance in the future.",

This depressive line of thought is contrasted with how he behaved when interacting with his friends, as it seems like he was hiding this sense of fatigue from his peers. \n\n\nAnd it is here the anime excels, as he struggles to justify protecting non-sorcerers after seeing how people within their ignorance could commit the evil deeds he witnessed. It is both his struggles and final breakdown that make for an engaging story, especially after seeing a more human side of him, particularly with his friendship with Gojou and the effort he put on protecting Rikko during this arc. One could say that it is by seeing his human side what makes both his struggles and later downfall even more captivating.\n\n\nHowever, the main drawback from this is that his newfound resolution of killing all non-sorcerers lacks believability, as even though it makes sense within the context of the series, it's still a far-fetched solution.

Similarly in later story motions, her progression in the next stage of her career is presented as something for furthering Aqua's ambitions, instead of celebrating what it means for her. This portrayal of her character in a dramatic sense is disappointing, though she is frequently given a narrator's position of comic relief on events that don't involve her directly - which refresh the positive expressions of her personality each time.   \n\n\nDespite being sidelined for many events occurring in the show, Kana's effervescent attitude and comedic relief play an important part in breaking up moments of tension, and the flow of the show is better as a result.

He only had one goal in mind; however, when that goal was taken away from him, Thorfinn finally faced his utter emptiness.\nSeason two starts on a completely different note, as he experiences how it feels to be on the receiving end of violence. The new relationships he forms, especially his evolving friendship with Einar, ignite in him a mixed sense of guilt and responsibility and guide him in understanding the people he has been persecuting for a long time.\n\n\nThorfinn eventually realizes that he is not the only person who lost someone dear in an unfair manner, which makes him unable to justify his past deeds anymore. He suffers from his past, as it's cued via visual symbolism, and finally decides to seek peace, which becomes one of the defining aspects of Thorfinn's character in season two. Though his fixation on a non-violent approach might feel a bit frustrating sometimes, the way he chooses not to be violent despite being powerful shapes him as an inspiring  hero.\n\n\nThorfinn's relationship with Canute is also worth mentioning; their inherent differences and the gradual changes in their values and beliefs make the climax of the season impactful.

As a harbinger of capitalist decay, Purple Man is a chaotic force with over the top schemes that help sell just how deranged he truly is. He is a key player in enabling a lot of what *IDOLiSH7: Third BEAT! Part 2* is going for as his plots and schemes are crucial in setting up the thematic and narrative ideas of the show, as he pushes his corporate agenda to diminish artistic expression. \n\n\nDespite Purple Man's strengths, his backstory and motivations aren't nearly as compelling. The reasoning given for his hatred for idols feels weak and ordinary given the extremity of his actions and general personality. It feels out of place given the over the top nature of Purple Man, and is as a whole underwhelming.\n\n\nStill, Purple Man is a delightful antagonist who manages to exude chaos and add spice to any scene he's a part of through uncanny mannerisms and a strong voice acting performance from Takahashi Hiroki. He shines consistently any time he is on screen, and is one of the strongest comedic characters and antagonists of the year.\n",

          "writeup": "At her core Chihaya Anon is selfish and manipulative, but that's part of why she stands out from the beginning of *BanG Dream! It's MyGO!!!!!*. Anon's desire for the spotlight drives much of the comedy in early episodes of *MyGO* and seeing her attempts fall flat is entertaining, as she tries to find any angle possible towards popularity. Her fun facial expressions only elevate the humor, as her excitement and frustration is hilariously wide open when others respond and foil her plans. This characterization only becomes funnier once the viewer realizes the pattern of incompetence and how she is lacking the skills to deserve any of the spotlight she desires.\n\n\nAnon has more going for her than just her comedy, as she also has a strong character arc in the middle of the show, when her painful past is revealed and she grows to care about more than just her own spotlight. During this progression she develops strong relationships with her fellow band members, particularly with Tomori as the two grow to understand each other and the significance of the promise they made to stay as a band for their whole lives.\n\n\nAnon excels regardless of the current direction or mood that *MyGO* is going for. She's able to star as the image-obsessed and attention-seeking teenager in light-hearted moments, while also showing strong depth when the show goes in a more serious direction. While Anon didn't manage to get the band named after herself, she still manages to steal the spotlight.\n",

She's one of the few characters who is genuinely nice, and shows real growth over the course of the show from a pushover into someone willing to stand up for herself.\n\n\nA main focus of her character is her strong relationship with Megumin, and how it fuels her development.

She is still frequently bullied by her, but it is clear that they both consider each other dear friends.\n\n\nAlongside her dramatic role, Yunyun is one of the driving forces of the show's comedy. As the designated straight man she has the unending task of trying to reign in the rest of the members. She always tries to keep a positive attitude, but the VA work does a fantastic job of conveying her frustration when things boil over.\n\n\nDespite taking a secondary role to Megumin within the show Yunyun is a joy to watch any time she is on screen, and her lack of presence is felt in the few episodes that she is absent. \n",

Strengthened by their heartwarming journey out of seclusion, Mahiro Oyama is further bolstered by exceptional character design, animation, and voice acting that amplify their comedic and emotional moments. There is no shortage of moving scenes where Mahiro connects with others, attaining confidence that contributes to some of the most delightful slice of life this year. However, the story is somewhat marred by the fact that Mahiro did not choose to embark on this journey, and the premise of them becoming a middle school girl and befriending other middle school girls, despite being an adult, is controversial. Nonetheless, the emotional moments still resonate, especially when considering the story is about Mahiro's second chance at life. Mahiro having many cute outfits to wear and their character animation showing not only their struggle but also their happier times provide an excellent foundation for these scenes.\n\n\nThe comedy involving Mahiro can be somewhat mixed, as a fair amount of it, especially early on, is based in ecchi, which does not blend well with the other problematic elements.While the fantastic expressions, expert joke framings, bombastic animation, and top-tier voice acting all contribute to making the comedic moments stand out, the reliance on ecchi humor may still not be your cup of tea.\n\n\nNonetheless, Mahiro is one of the greatest comedic characters from this year, thanks to exceptional production values and a tale of rehabilitation and happiness that is hard to match.\n",

Coming from the countryside, Mitsumi offers a fresh perspective that contrasts with her more jaded city peers, allowing her to see individuals for who they truly are, free from preconceived notions. It is through this optimism that Mitsumi is able not only to connect herself to others but also to connect others together.\n\n\nWhile Mitsumi's awkwardness often comes across as cute, her personality is somewhat extreme. In some ways she plays the role of manic pixie dream girl for the cast, appearing from nowhere to rescue the other characters from their dysfunction. However, her positivity reaches an almost unrealistic level, leading occasional dramatic scenarios in the end to not work as well. Yet, in other ways, she breaks from this archetype, simply by virtue of being the primary perspective character. While Shima is very clearly a main focus, this is largely Mitsumi's story, and she inserts herself into social dynamics rather broadly rather than specifically changing his life.\n\n\nA breath of fresh air, Mitsumi prevents the story from being bogged down with senseless drama.This in turn makes Mitsumi a crowd favorite to both the audience and the characters in her story, as everyone learns to appreciate themselves and those around them. Mitsumi's talent for recognizing what makes each individual special is what distinguishes herself as one of this year's best comedic characters.\n",

Instead of following the competitive aspect of choosing a \"winning\" girl, he focuses on successfully managing a harem where no one feels left out.\n\n\nA readily charismatic character, Rentarou goes out of his way to ensure the happiness of his numerous girlfriends. From his willingness to protect them to his shower of affection, it's easy to see how his over-the-top efforts for his girlfriends are an appreciable quality.\n\n\nHowever, Rentarou lacks a distinct personality, making him a protagonist that isn't particularly compelling. Underutilized in the show's humor compared to the other girlfriends, Rentarou is often relegated to the back, waiting on his chance to demonstrate his worth as a boyfriend while the girls take on a more active role driving the comedy. Unfortunately, due to the nature of the story, the relationships portrayed also lack depth and time to flourish. The girls' dynamics with Rentarou also fail to provide any meaningful character development beyond the tropes they represent.\n\n\nStill, Rentarou's insane acts of loyalty towards his girlfriends make him an amiable lead. Even if his actions are less engaging compared to those of his girlfriends, his collective quest for love makes for a fun romp to watch. Combined with his magnetism, Rentarou Aijou provides a fun change of pace from the usual harem protagonist.\n",

Despite being able to read other's minds, her child-like naivete still leads her to perceive normal situations as potential disasters, dragging an exasperated Loid in circles as he tries to keep up with her whims that change every moment. While her precognitive actions create some of the funnier bits in the show, they do lead to some drawn out scenarios when she is unable to act on situations because of her age or commitment to keeping her telepathy a secret.\n\n\nAnya's love for her family and wish to keep them together make for a wholesome character motivation, and it only grows stronger as both Loid and Yor show a genuine willingness to do the same. This resolve combined with the hilarity she provides every episode maintains Anya as one of the strong points from one of the best comedies of the year. \n",

Cid shines brightest when he succeeds through luck and improvisation, resulting in his strongest moments being when he breaks character or internally screams when his plans narrowly succeed. Along with his unapologetic demeanor, Cid offers both amusement and relatability to the viewer.\n\n\nHowever, unclear development of his own life contributes to a sense of incomplete characterization, and the narrative lacks a deeper look into his personality and motivations besides indulging in his fantasies. Additionally, moments of self-awareness are often confined to brief musings in which he likens events to anime scenarios, and because the narrative proceeds in a straightforward manner, the impact of the commentary is often rendered flat. \n\n\nDespite lacking depth that would make him a more compelling character, Cid still enjoys moments of brilliance. The anime excels in presenting him as a grandiose figure, complete with voice acting that can shift instantly with exaggerated mannerisms. Ultimately, Cid serves as a welcoming protagonist in a story that indulges in the fantasies of a teenager.",

Mikoto's despair is represented with dark, foreboding cuts, representing the darker thoughts that he has towards Minato. The youthful energy of Uta and Minato is represented by real-world photography as they run through a neighborhood. These touches go above and beyond to develop the cast in a unique way.\n\n\nThere is a noticeable imbalance of focus between the Kirishimas and the Yuzukis, especially as they are shown to be so close. Mikoto's role is also diminished by the end of the show as an angelic older brother to Minato, which is a shame.

The show immediately makes you want to learn more about these characters and gives you clear people to root for.\n\n\nIt subverts the typical underdog storyline by spending a reasonable portion of the show focusing on the favored racers. Satsuki has to take a back seat when he gets injured, and *Overtake* uses this opportunity to highlight Arisu's character, showing her genuine care for him in contrast to the fangirls that he's usually surrounded by. Toshiki has to step into his shoes and is forced to reevaluate his role as a driver when he realizes how difficult being the lead is.\n\n\nKouya's backstory adequately explains all the strange hesitations he has when taking photos. However, it somewhat disrupts the other storylines, as Haru has to step away from Komaki motors to try to help him. Still, it delicately handles the scenario without ignoring the long-term impact that traumatic events can have on people.\n\n\nThe results of the final episodes are relatively predictable, as underdog stories tend to be.

The unique \"energy\" that each character has allows for very peculiar interactions when they meet each other, feeling as if the dynamics between any two could lead to some hilariously crazy outcome (as it tends to do).\n\n\nThat being said, even though their quirkiness is of note, there was a prevalence of more dramatic shows that explored the characters at length, and this show couldn't compete when it comes to character exploration. Its overall repetitiveness stands out negatively when compared to the emotional heights some of the other entries manage to achieve. While emotional development is not entirely absent in *Urusei Yatsura*, as some developments between Lum and Ataru's relationship have become more palpable, its slow burn approach means that it only managed to touch the surface of what we might get in future seasons.  Even so, there's a great sense of appreciation to how this anime served as a bridge for connecting new audiences to this classic, with more people now being familiarized to the shenanigans of this charming cast.

No character is left behind; everyone introduced not only stays relevant but is given inward perspective and depth through their thoughts and mannerisms.\n \n\nThe beating heart of the show, Mitsumi, has an infectious blend of earnestness and neuroticism that makes it impossible not to root for her, and she brings the best out of everyone around her. She and Shima play off each other well. Their growing friendship, instinctive ability to lift each other's mood, and way of resolving disputes openly and maturely, is a constant delight.\n \n\nIn the supporting cast Egashira shines as the “mean girl” going to great lengths to be what she thinks is an ideal high school girl in order to address her past insecurities, and in doing so stands in contrast to Mitsumi's authenticity. Murashige and Makoto strike up unlikely close friendships, and Nao-chan provides both a good mentor for Mitsumi and a good example of trans representation. Even Ririka, a divisive antagonist figure, has all of her actions and feelings contextualized so as to be understandable, if not immediately forgivable.\n \n\n*Skip and Loafer* is a masterclass in creating a large ensemble cast. Characters are flawed but well-meaning and will reflect when checked on their behavior by others, which leads to satisfying conflict resolutions and steady growth for everybody.",

          "writeup": "How many girlfriends are too many? Stuck with the fortunate yet burdensome fated role of being soul mates to not just one girl, but 100, Rentarou of *Kimi no Koto ga Dai Dai Dai Dai Daisuki na 100-nin no Kanojo* humorously and passionately explores what such a fate entails as the reluctant protagonist's harem rapidly expands. \n\n\nThe introductory episodes for each girl in Rentarou's harem provide most of the series's character exploration.The fated connection with Rentaurou that the girls are inescapably ordained with makes for a mixed message in relation to the value of women. On one hand Rentarou earnestly accepts the girls as they are, and his drive to accommodate their passions provides a heartfelt appreciation of individual identity. This strongly contributes to making the girls feel like more than a simple embodiment of character tropes. On the other hand, the fated connection is only ever at the behest and benefit to Rentarou which concerningly nullifies any sense of choice the girls in the show have. This is particularly egregious through the “kiss zombie” episodes and in meeting Hakari's mom. \n  \n\nIn spite of the troubling thematic messaging with regards to the position of women in relation to men, the show presents a multitude of the interactions between the cast in mainly positive situations where each member is able to shine as themselves, balancing ecchi and wholesome moments surprisingly well. \n",

Einar enters as an excellent foil for Thorfinn: the hot-headed peasant out for revenge gets paired with the jaded child soldier who has lost the survival instinct that brought him this far. Over the course of the show, we see Thorfinn begin to gain a new purpose, and his attitude shift consequently sculpts Einar into a softer person.\n\n\nKetil's family is fascinating and multifaceted. The patriarch \"Iron-fist\" Ketil is a magnanimous village leader willing to give Thorfinn and Einar a chance to buy their freedom, but we learn later that he has deep-seated insecurities that his son Thorgil is able to exploit. Similarly, Olmar is full of bluster, but after being made a fool he begins an ongoing journey to try to become his own person.\n\n\nArnheid is set up to join Einar in redemption, but when fate brings Gardar back into the picture, her role is greatly diminished to a poor widow who can't move on. Unlike Arnheid, Canute develops his own set of convictions as the phantom of King Sweyn haunts him. The confrontation between Thorfinn and Canute at the end of the season is the apotheosis of the redemption that was set up by the show's excellently woven character development.\n\n\n*Vinland Saga* was chosen as the third place finisher, but it's more an indication of the strength of this year's nominees for cast than an indictment on the enormous amount that it was able to accomplish.",

She is wonderfully expressive through varied character animation, and has a compelling personal arc through the series. Whether it's playing an exasperated straight man to the rest of the cast or displaying vulnerability in softer moments, she never fails to leave an impression.\n \n\nWhere *Oshi no Ko*'s cast disappoints is the usage of the series' protagonists, Aqua and Ruby. Despite being positioned in the premiere as co-leads, Ruby is frustratingly sidelined for much of the series in favor of Aqua's revenge plot. Aqua's recurring role as a white knight in the storylines of the series's female characters - particularly Akane's - also leaves a sour taste in the mouth. \n\n\nAi's initial struggle with her double life of being a teenage mother and popular idol, and her charisma that shine through the screen, do well to create a character who can believably cast a large shadow over the narrative and its characters. Following from Ai's storyline, the show continues to establish its characters and make them relatable through exploring their issues, from Akane's struggles with anxiety and cyber-bullying, Mem-cho's concerns about aging out of her desired career, or Kana's pursuit to reinvent herself following an extended downturn of success. \n\n\nDespite some missteps, overall *Oshi no Ko* manages to deliver an engaging cast of characters with compelling personal narratives.

These standout moments showcase not only incredible feats of strength, but palpable and compelling emotional depth.Through these two factors, the series manages to make its cast shine, as it allows the viewer to invest into each character, their backgrounds and reasons to fight, as well as on how these clash against cunning, sadistic villains that embody everything they stand against.  \n\n\nHowever, due to the size of the cast and the imbalance in both screen time and overall performance, the series doesn't always manage to bring the best of them. During the Shibuya arc, many characters feel like they are left behind or sidelined. The season also has a tendency to overuse deaths for shock value, cheapening what would otherwise have been emotional moments. Beloved characters were tactlessly reduced to mere props in service of Yuuji's character development. \n\n\nNonetheless the show stands out on how ambitiously it depicts pivotal moments within the series and how well it manages to bring about some of the most memorable fights and individual character arcs of 2023.

This does however make the stronger episode showings all the more appealing and notable, but a solid execution across the production is always going to be preferred.\n\n\nRegardless, *U149*'s baseline is still quite commendable for a show as [bustling on the character front](https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/e997c35f352f8530cff0bbb07b735652.mp4) as it is, going above and beyond at key moments, such as during performances or pivotal retrospective scenes.",

That's in huge part due to giving its staff more leeway in the animation direction department for how they want to portray this cast's emotions.

In addition, debut character designer Ryo Imamura's [approach to character animation](https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/53761983ca4933c697d3a5763452ae04.mp4), and particularly volume through well considered linework, has left quite the impact on the industry overall. Toshiya Ootomo's as animation producer amplified the connections of those already involved, creating a beacon for numerous more including the likes of Eri Irei, Hironori Tanaka, and Toshiyuki Sato, inevitably contributing to some of the best visual experiences of the show.\n\n\nWhile there are many strengths to the animation production overall, one of the most impressive factors is how the character animation is used as a tool for the narrative of the series.

Also, who can forget the meme power of iconic [light stick cheering](https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/db4256d29e1764d73ab80a94e296cf20.mp4).\n\n\nDisappointingly, *Oshi no Ko* largely fails to present the viewer any strong highlights or examples of charming character animation outside of the show's strong finale and double-length premiere. Its core philosophy of making sure Kappe's spectacular designs will stay consistent throughout the show doesn't allow *Oshi no Ko* to achieve any sort of charismatic character acting that could possibly go off-base through either some exaggeration or just general dynamic movement. As a result, the animation overall feels very underwhelming and lacking in any strong punctuation that would truly make these characters come to life, something that pretty much every other nomination in this category mostly excels at. That's not to say *Oshi no Ko*'s strongest moments don't have anything to offer. But the highlights and consistency of our other nominations are just too strong to place one of the year's most popular anime any higher.\n",

Its tendency to reuse slow motion fade ins and outs on a regular basis often kills any tempo of a fight by segmenting it into awkward short bursts of energy that lack proper pacing. Additionally, the infamous usage of CG never fails to take the viewer out of the tense experience during fights.

There are many years where the jury struggles to narrow down their options, but this year unfortunately was not one of those years. Though there were some other entries up for discussion, such as *ONIMUSHA* and *Hikari no Ou*, there was easy consensus for the top entries. Despite the lack of quantity, there was a lot of quality in this past year's background art nominations, making this year still a standout one for background art.",

          "writeup": "*Hi no Tori: Eden no Sora*'s story takes place over a millennia and the backgrounds wonderfully highlight this passage of time over the course of the show: On a small scale, there's subtle differences between the same backgrounds shown a few years apart like the [amount of vegetation](https://imgur.com/a/PKHI0Qj) and the [positioning of planets](https://imgur.com/a/dyfiaPB); on a large scale, there's the breathtaking sequence showcasing how civilization grew on Eden over the course of these thousand years.\n\n\nThe backgrounds are incredibly detailed, leading each one to really stand out individually, from the rocky surface of the [desolate Eden](https://i.imgur.com/jrQ713m.png) to the [mechanical wiring in ships](https://i.imgur.com/0iiHuDE.png) to the natural beauty on [Heaven Island](https://i.imgur.com/pOYzbVP.png) and how that juxtaposes the rundown dystopia of [Earth](https://i.imgur.com/o0HIAok.png). However, this attention to detail leads to compositing issues with the characters and texturing problems, which mostly occur when the show uses 3D backgrounds of spaceships.\n\n\nWith *Hi no Tori: Eden no Sora*'s shorter four-episode runtime, some of its backgrounds get overused, particularly the [spaceship](https://i.imgur.com/KDe4BnA.png) used to traverse space in the latter half of episode two and the majority of episode three. Though this space travel leads to some awe-inspiring visuals of both [individual planets](https://i.imgur.com/WgP6nAC.png) and massive galaxies.\n\n\nWhile its sci-fi setting is fairly generic, *Hi no Tori: Eden no Sora*'s breathtaking backgrounds feature incredible detailing and give life to the show's world with how they portray the passage of time.",

          "writeup": "The appeal of *Akuma-kun*'s backgrounds becomes immediately evident in the opening scene of the show. A montage inside the Millenarianism Research Institute that showcases *Akuma-kun*'s striking style in [all its glory](https://i.imgur.com/UT6d0y1.png), featuring large swathes of black shading that adds depth and enchantment to backgrounds, creating an almost cel-shaded comic book aesthetic.\n\n\nYuga Kumiko's art direction effectively utilizes the lineart to match the mood of each scene. For example, adding more black lines to ramp up the suspense, or switching the color up entirely using white lines in the sky during happier moments. However, the usage of [red](https://i.imgur.com/4QKmKki.png) later in the show, and various filters for spells, like the [rust-like effect](https://i.imgur.com/dSBn2YP.png), stand out as aesthetically unappealing.\n\n\n*Akuma-kun* is able to show off a number of different locations from more normal locations such as a [mansion](https://i.imgur.com/o2wd9vf.png) or [tropical island](https://i.imgur.com/8qibQVs.png) to more fantastical ones like the [Invisible School](https://i.imgur.com/b5HfyCP.png). However, a lot of *Akuma-kun*'s runtime is at the Millenarianism Research Institute which ends up feeling a bit repetitive by the end. While the locale starts to lose its intrigue, exploring each individual shot continues to be interesting due to a good variety of camera angles being used. In addition, there are tables filled with piled up books and walls cluttered by a [variety of knick knacks](https://i.imgur.com/z87L0uF.png). These attributes stay present, as [objects scattered around](https://i.imgur.com/R3PzzM6.png) bring life to indoor environments for the rest of the show.\n\n\n*Akuma-kun*'s backgrounds achieve a rare feat for horror anime by aiding its eerie atmosphere while being visually stunning at the same time.\n",

          "writeup": "Compared to most anime, and even the other nominations, *Tsurune: Tsunagari no Issha* focuses on high fidelity. Instead of being flashy or stylized, a consistent level of detail creates a grounded environment for the characters to inhabit. For instance, much of the season takes place in [various Kyūdō ranges](https://imgur.com/zRr62DB.png). The wood, tile and tatami inside and the [distant foliage and targets](https://imgur.com/pT5D0Lp.png), shot from every possible angle, make for highly memorable settings. Further still, the stark differences between the ranges of the three schools reflects their different origins. The size of [Kirisaki's range](https://imgur.com/6kTTvyZ.png) and their many trophies show their schools commitment to the sport, unlike [Tsujimine's](https://imgur.com/ZhRRk4N.png) grassroots team and their DIY range.\n\n\nOutside of these common locations, *Tsurune* doesn't always achieve the high bar it sets for itself. Many of the one-off locations are a notable step down in quality compared to more common settings like the ranges. Schools and inns are sometimes rendered with care, and sometimes [feel oddly empty](https://imgur.com/MazJZ2T.png). On the color side, *Tsurune* strongly blooms its bright outdoor settings. Greens and yellows in particular take on a [distracting saturated shade](https://imgur.com/wnBhER6.png). This is most noticeable during the sunny practice sessions, and interior lighting, as well as the [evenings and nights](https://imgur.com/H3PDUo1.png), is much more palatable.\n\n\n*Tsurune*'s best backgrounds are rich in detailing and conveying believable locations. Places that look lived-in feel real and engaging to watch. But inconsistent execution of the variety of settings and lighting, plus lack of much style of its own holds the show back among stronger nominees.\n",

          "writeup": "*Ousama Ranking* returns to the best of the year for background art with its short story collection series *Ousama Ranking: Yuuki no Takarabako*. In terms of styling, it maintains a lot of the appeal of art director Yuuji Kaneko's artwork from season one. The [nicker painted backgrounds](https://i.imgur.com/bMWRR5z.png) and mixed media perfectly portray the whimsical picture book style the series is going for. The [blobby](https://i.imgur.com/dsxLPWO.png) paint and the lack of clean, straight black outlines helps give the series a vibrant, youthful feel. The few times it does use [clean outlines](https://i.imgur.com/EW3g59X.png) is in settings like inside the castle which help depict themes of order and justice. Meanwhile, the short story nature of this series also means the characters don't stay in one setting for long, giving the viewer a variety of locations to look forward to.\n\n\nBesides aforementioned variety in locations, the style varies too, such as the [watercolors](https://i.imgur.com/Ssi9bWV.png) in episode eight and the outlineless [forest](https://i.imgur.com/IIepZpb.png) in episode nine, reminiscent of Ale Abreu's work in his movie *Perlimps*. Some episodes do have weaker settings though, like the desert in episode two, as well as some setting reuse from season one. However, the execution of all these various locations is phenomenal, and they get enhanced by the well-constructed layouts which emphasize depth and volume. These techniques make plain interiors immersive and enhance the scale with the [wide-angle curvature](https://i.imgur.com/xqOmaGZ.png) of the flooring and furniture. Overall, *Ousama Ranking: Yuuki no Takarabako* executes its picture book style with creativity and diversity.",

While these structures are sparsely populated as each biome's community struggles to survive on limited resources, they also feel life-like through the routines and interactions of their inhabitants. These locales can range from small villages with [cozy bars](https://i.imgur.com/OGvM6YX.png) and [rooms](https://i.imgur.com/WEccnZd.png) to [sterile lab environments](https://i.imgur.com/PNbJPUS.png) in technologically advanced ships to [run-down plants](https://i.imgur.com/rz4a4sD.png) full of aging machinery.\n\n\nOne of the most intriguing changes in how the backgrounds are depicted comes through Wolfwood's backstory, where the environments have [pencil hatching](https://i.imgur.com/U5Dvjvy.png) to create shadows and textures that amplify both the [warmth of his youth](https://i.imgur.com/iwEy6vY.png) and the [harshness of the world](https://i.imgur.com/oNtAOEI.png).

          "writeup": "*Kimi wa Houkago Insomnia*'s romance centers on two people who feel unwelcome during the day and find solace in the night. Night to them is almost another world, and the backgrounds are our window into it. At night, the scale of the starry sky [dwarfs the characters](https://imgur.com/mKucxk9.png), and [long exposure star trails](https://imgur.com/yRMt5hS.png) imply a timelessness to the nights. [Empty streets to wander](https://imgur.com/F2ZzUq3.png), all bathed in dreamy blue, amplify their feelings of freedom while the world sleeps, setting a wonderful stage for bonding and growing closer.\n\n\nOutside of these highlights, *Insomnia* often struggles. Most of the [daytime backgrounds are very plain](https://imgur.com/CdDVgcT.png), with locations and architecture consisting of simple shapes and colors acting as [a bare minimum setting](https://imgur.com/sic9NxO.png). Lighting-wise, many scenes feel [flat and unnaturally even](https://imgur.com/GuWW1HD.png), where in others the lighting and shading are incohesive. Perspective shots are often unconvincing, creating unnaturally large and empty settings where people, furniture and other objects feel like [they don't coexist in the same space](https://imgur.com/3WikMyZ.png).\n\n\nOne more consistently standout location is [the observatory hideout](https://imgur.com/wDD9QoG.png). The busy history of the observatory comes through in the background details, creating a space that feels messy but cozy and lived-in. In addition, the care given to the authenticity of the layout and structure of the room itself expresses the [importance of this room](https://imgur.com/s3CacvP.png).\n\n\n[Exaggerated starscapes and deep blue nights](https://imgur.com/gK9Xr03.png) shine brightest in *Kimi wa Houkago Insomnia*.

          "writeup": "*Jujutsu Kaisen 2nd Season* adapts two arcs of the manga, the Hidden Inventory arc focusing on Gojo's past, and the Shibuya Incident arc revolving around battles occurring in Shibuya. The Hidden Inventory arc manages to showcase a good variety of settings; an [aquarium](https://i.imgur.com/uaxiycm.png), the school, the Tengen shrine, and the [city](https://i.imgur.com/YZqKbTR.png). This variety gives opportunity for the background art staff to show off their craft and punch up the [vibrancy](https://i.imgur.com/PgmbzJW.png) in their work.\n\n\nIn comparison, like in season one of the series where the second cour is largely stuck in a forest, this season's second cour is largely stuck in [Shibuya](https://i.imgur.com/R0fs4Wo.png). And not just Shibuya at large, but many episodes are set in a [subway station](https://i.imgur.com/OOc9UgN.png) which unfortunately does not make for the most investing of locations to be constantly looking at. A major positive of this arc and its backgrounds though is the changes that would occur as battles rage on. The storyboarding in the series manages to emphasize this [demolition](https://i.imgur.com/mgZ0fDL.png). This helps to keep the backgrounds engaging even during battle scenes where most series would try to make the background as flat and arena-like as possible. The series also depicts [street signs](https://i.imgur.com/IqCE5Wa.png) in various ways, which adds to the hyper-realism the show goes for in keeping its Shibuya setting grounded. \n\n\nDespite its faults, *Jujutsu Kaisen 2nd Season* does a stellar job at depicting its locations.

Given the change in setting compared to the first season, there's a more intimate focus on the confines of [Ketil's farm](https://i.imgur.com/P4Jkt4T.jpeg) and its [scenery](https://i.imgur.com/ndb8sLW.jpeg) in comparison to the more nomadic approach of the first season.\n\n\nKetil's farm contains [charming vistas of vast forestation](https://i.imgur.com/MrDgjEH.jpeg) and [wheat fields](https://i.imgur.com/9wpNajq.jpeg), alongside [detailed lodgings](https://i.imgur.com/ZbR1kie.jpeg) that create an element of coziness among a backdrop of greens and yellows. While the architecture and structural layout of these environments and their usage is tonally the climax of the show's atmosphere, several missteps lower the potency of their intent. Despite the architecture being intriguing, their interiors remain uninteresting and fail to capitalize on the same cultural charm as exterior shots; often environments lack good color variation to differentiate from the norm which lessens the impact of more dramatic and tense moments by appearing flatter. This extends to how the horizons and planes intersect in a scene, causing an imbalance between how a character [appears in the foreground](https://i.imgur.com/rHDIvji.png) and how they should [integrate with their surroundings.](https://i.imgur.com/qjMmEXq.jpeg)\n\n\nHowever, landscape shots and establishing shots tend to get better when revolving around [water](https://i.imgur.com/E7Hxst1.jpeg), such as [reintroducing Iceland](https://i.imgur.com/rcznDze.png) and the [cliffs](https://i.imgur.com/vxHF2yC.png) where Thorfinn and Canute discuss their beliefs; adding blues and reds that create a more dynamic clash of mood compared to prior outings.

However, this style sometimes hinders the backgrounds due to extreme blur obscuring textures within them. In addition, the show's color palette mostly consists of grays and browns, leading to the backgrounds sometimes looking dull. When the show does use vibrant colors, it occasionally ends up [looking garish](https://i.imgur.com/4L4PEvA.png).\n\n\n*Mushoku Tensei*'s architecture is an interesting mix of real life and fantasy, leading to unique designs that stand out compared to other fantasy anime. Furthermore, each new region's architecture is visually distinct, which is a big boon to the show's worldbuilding. However, indoor environments are weaker, especially in Basherant, where they only contain the [bare minimum in furniture](https://i.imgur.com/znottPf.png).

          "writeup": "*THE iDOLM@STER Cinderella Girls: U149* follows in the tradition set by the series preceding it, including motifs like dresses resembling the fairytale it is named for in its main performance. More importantly, Norie Igawa brings the expressive character animation and personable outfits the series is known for and applies them to this cast of young, aspiring idols.\n\n\nWhile some designs are somewhat lackluster for some of the girls with plainer personalities, most give a window into the girls' personalities. Haru is sporty and tomboyish, Momoka is refined and measured, Risa is brash and a bit of a show-off, and Arisu is more reserved and thoughtful. Even the younger kids who come off as more plain do so somewhat intentionally. And can't forget Nina with her kigurumi! They work thematically in how they display the youth of the characters, and connect the girls to their producer, as the producer is also often looked down upon for idealism and short stature. Characters are also capable of wild, cartoonish expressions that contribute to the more comedic moments while allowing for emotional moments to connect. As an example, Arisu displays some of the most varied exaggeration during comedic scenes, often comically surprised, suspicious or angry. Yet, she also has some of the most emotional scenes, showing disappointment or sadness in her expression. Even side characters feel alive and personable. In this way, U149 serves as both a faithful adherent to the series' principles and one of the standout series this year for its designs.\n",

Masako Matsumoto of Studio Troyca's debut show *Aldnoah Zero* returns to design for their 10th Anniversary show, and her experience is evident. Perfecting the racing experience was pivotal, and details from Komaki Motor's nearly blank livery due to lack of sponsors, to the different colors on the wheels wheel walls for different types of tires, to the multi-layered racing suits all contributed to make the races come alive.\n\n\nThe racers' eyes are a particular triumph - Haruka's piercing blue irises, Toshiki's tiny pupils, and Satsuki's soft brown eyes make them easily identifiable when wearing their helmets. In contrast to the seriousness of the racers, there are characters like the Komakis and Arisu, who have more rounded features, giving subtle hints to their more laid-back personalities. Arisu in particular is a joy to watch; the animators were able to stretch their wings and take liberties with her design to give her a bubbly, expressive manner.\n\n\nThere is a solid visual identity communicated through different outfits - each team has identifiable uniforms, and team cheerleaders' outfits pop with trademark colors. However, despite rock-solid fundamentals, *Overtake* doesn't push the envelope in many areas. There are many similar hairstyles among the main characters, and the designs occasionally aren't recognizable from a distance.\n\n\nNevertheless, even though *Overtake* doesn't stand out at first glance, the passion and research poured into this show is evident. With so few obvious flaws, and considering the detail and consistency that the show is able to achieve, *Overtake* earns a commendable 3rd place finish.\n",

Mika, plagued by self-doubt and body image issues, contrasts with Mitsumi, who is completely fashion ignorant. Further extremes are demonstrated with Makoto and Yuzuki, and all together along with the male cast they make for a wonderful variety of personalities and outfits.\n\n\nCharacter designer and chief animation director Manami Umeshita focused her efforts on character expressivity.

Nao-chan is an excellent trans character - she is distinctly feminine, but tiny details such as her pronounced clavicle acknowledge what it means to transition. The school uniforms change through the seasons, incorporating hoodies and cardigans alongside blazers and ties. They provide subtle windows into the characters through clever neatness or untidiness.\n\n\nIn the end, *Skip and Loafer* has an extremely solid set of designs, but lacks somewhat in novelty compared to higher ranked entries. Its fifth place finish is a satisfying result for a show with such a high degree of polish.",

          "writeup": "Ryo Imamura leverages his unique style to convey the narrative of *Onii-chan wa Oshimai!* through character design. This is an anime that exudes its production confidence with an absurd number of outfit, background character, and prop designs while maintaining design principle excellence. The core design of this narrative being Mahiro whose internal conflict drives the design philosophy for the whole series. \n\n\nMahiro's [masculine](https://i.imgur.com/Ovx1dl9.jpeg) sense of physicality and fashion progressively becomes more feminine over time. The buildup is subtle and masked by the more overt design motifs. An obvious example being the pastel color schemes that often feature contrasting [warm pinks](https://i.imgur.com/TNIwzzN.jpeg) and [cool blues](https://i.imgur.com/3oJJtys.png). The entire cast follows this theme of self-expression as well. Mihari's stubborn adherence to her routine attire, Momiji's boyish nature, and Kaede's hyper-feminine voluptuousness serve as design foils to Mahiro's journey. This approach extends to a staggering number of outfits for each character with the seasonal outfits being especially key to conveying the passage of time. \n\n\n[Tone-matching lines](https://i.imgur.com/iDaE5m8) and thoughtful shadow placement give characters a greater sense of volume without making them more difficult to draw. Imamura's [quirk](https://i.imgur.com/5Sg4tMV.jpeg) of drawing the line from the forearm straight through to the upper arm; And the same with hands from the index through the thumb.

          "writeup": "*Tengoku Daimakyou*'s designs take after their source material rather faithfully. The round shapes of the original designs by Masakazu Ishiguro translate well into animation. The designs are loose enough to allow for some great expressiveness and downright cartoonish exaggeration serving to contrast its gritty, stark aesthetic. \n\n\nOn the note of *Tengoku*'s harsh world, the man-eater designs are a big highlight. Each one is an unnerving fusion of some recognizable animal and otherworldly features. Their awkward anatomy often gives way to memorable first impressions. Noticeable is also how vivid and colorful the monsters are, sporting bright and even neon-red and blue colors that contrast strongly against the drab shades of the post-apocalyptic world, especially in the dark nighttime where the creatures are mostly encountered. The bright colors make the monsters seem downright alien, but curiously their body parts are strangely proportioned and arranged mimicry of real-life creatures. \n\n\nThe pristine white of the children's uniforms in Heaven contrasts very well with the darker color mosaic of characters in the post-apocalypse. The juxtaposition makes the characters in the outside world seem more chaotic and jumbled, while the lab kids are more controlled and orderly. But outside of this broader contrast, almost all of the other sources of colors in clothing are usually very muted and dark and overall unremarkable, an unfortunate shortcoming in 2023. But despite this, the strength of the monster designs in tandem with the cartoonishly expressive facial designs and expressions somewhat make up for this.\n",

          "writeup": "*Trigun Stampede*'s style places emphasis on distinct facial contours, colors, and distinctive fashion that work well in the 3d format. The silhouettes hold great importance in *Trigun*. Many of the show's cast have a visually remarkable feature like Nick's giant cross gun or Knives jaggad tapestry of blades surrounding him that stand out even in the negative space of the frequent far shots of the show's backgrounds. The use of colors also play a similarly crucial role, with Vash's red coat and Meryl's blue hat making them easy to pick out at a distance, which works well in service of *Trigun*'s wide shots showcasing its vast landscapes. \n\n\nThe outfits do a great job conveying the personality of the characters at a glance. For example, Meryl's outfit, particularly her signature hat, feels a bit too chic for the inhospitable desert planet, but her seeming out of her element fits character and serves to contrast her visual badassification late in the series. Outside of the main cast, *Trigun Stampede* boasts an impressive rogues gallery that draws from a wide variety of aesthetic inspirations that blend sci-fi, western, and mad max post-apocalypse elements in keeping with their zany, energetic personalities. This is particularly the case with the actual power ranger villains like the zany white-haired Professor and his monstrous ‘son', the Mad Max Bubble Boy, or the skull-faced Monev dual wielding miniguns in his massive battlesuit.\n\n\nWith its distinct character designs, creative villains, and emphasis on color and silhouette, *Trigun Stampede* has some of the most visually captivating designs of the year.\n",

Meanwhile, their less detailed, exaggerated forms maintain their silhouettes for the [reaction face](https://i.imgur.com/i2mejL6.jpeg) comedy audiences will be very familiar with. \n\n\nThe use of color and archetypal design tropes to distinguish each girl from one another is a well-established convention in this genre. Hakari, Shizuka, and Kusuri's designs are much more [round](https://i.imgur.com/iIv435X.jpeg) to denote their cuteness while Karane and Nano have [sharper](https://i.imgur.com/fmYTYs5.jpeg) features that give way to coldness or [distance](https://i.imgur.com/ca6Cl3f.png). The approach works like a sliding scale between these two characteristics and will undoubtedly be effective for the 90+ more designs to follow.

          "writeup": "*Kidou Senshi Gundam: Suisei no Majo* is a fresh take on traditional *Gundam* character design with a wide variety of meticulously crafted new mobile suits. Suletta and Miorine have strong designs that each communicate important parts of their characters - Suletta's slightly unkempt hair and large eyebrows hints at her backwater upbringing on Mercury, and Miorine's professional attire indicates her familial ties to the corporations in the show.\n\n\nThere are several standouts in their immediate surrounding cast as well. For example, Chuchu's giant twin pink afros are as big as the chip on her shoulder. Prospera's mask is an immediate clue for long-time *Gundam* fans, calling back to Char Anzible's signature design. However, beyond the mask, her design isn't nearly as iconic. Additionally, characters are often in space suits that hide their signature features, making them hard to identify.\n\n\nCompounding the difficulty is the use of training mobile suits in many fights. Obviously the main suits like Suletta's Aerial or Guel's Dilanza are easy to pick out, but when they're in battle against four near-identical designs, the flaws of this approach become apparent. Still, the show is filled with an abundance of unique and innovative new suits. The Swarzette's half-wing design is a welcome use of asymmetry that isn't often seen in mobile suit design.\n\n\n*G-Witch* has moments of brilliance, but the balance tilts slightly towards unsuccessful design choices.

Sayaka Koiso revamps the charismatic foundation left by her predecessor with a more minimalist interpretation. Many of the clothing folds and highlights of the [first season designs](https://i.imgur.com/6ejo4tC.png) have been removed in the second season, resulting in a significantly [lower line count](https://i.imgur.com/RZezJk9.jpeg). The removal of the highlights effectively turns every tri-color scheme into a bi-color scheme, emphasizing forms over details. The reduced complexity results in a cleaner, more balanced character art that is easier to animate and supervise. This is particularly crucial for such an action heavy season. \n\n\nThe Hidden Inventory arc is a strong showcase for this design approach as the more youthful character antics by the younger versions of the cast give us many fun, [exaggerated expressions](https://i.imgur.com/3EZcPmg.jpeg).

In terms of color, it uses a palette of blue, yellow, red, and pink primarily for outfits and hair colors. Instead of going with pastels or bright versions of these colors, it tends to go for darker tones of these main colors to contrast with white and gold accents which pop. \n\n\nThe stars of the show stand out quite well, which does clash with the mundane look of the rest of the world's characters, but helps those who are meant to catch attention both in universe and for the audience of the show to stand out. The side characters don't stand out as much, which seems to some degree intentional. The large stars which cover the eyes of Ai, Aqua, and Ruby are garish, but the fine lines and meticulous coloring help make them less obtrusive. \n\n\nWhile the dedication to fidelity of the designs keeps them appealing for promotional artwork, it also serves as one of the biggest weaknesses of the show in some ways. Animation is limited by this desire to remain close to the original designs, although some skilled staff still make some moments and characters stand out. Kana in particular is a shining example, as her sharp hair and cute features elevated her expressive personality more than any other character.\n",

Skillfully employing traditional stage techniques within its animated medium, particularly through stage lighting, the show crafts striking compositions and poignant visual metaphors. \n\n\nThe significance of [lighting](https://imgur.com/a/fzh7LyQ) is symbolic of the cinematography's commitment to visual motifs that traverse individual narrative arcs. Notable examples include close ups on the protagonist's hands and the cast's [vividly colored eyes](https://imgur.com/a/zXtTZYt), which transcend initial representations of acting ability to convey their goals, relationships, and emotional vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the cinematography pays homage to visual devices from the iconic plays reproduced by the cast. For instance, fans of *Tale of the Bamboo Cutter* and *The Phantom of the Opera* will appreciate how the [moon](https://i.imgur.com/j2WORyC.png) and seating box are used outside of performances to foreshadow events and professional struggles.\n\n\nWhile excelling in theater scenes, the cinematography noticeably declines off stage. Despite honorable efforts such as blocking or framing to [convey emotional distance](https://imgur.com/a/7bsA6OP), the average layout and editing tends to be unimaginative, resulting in predominantly lackluster non-theater scenes.\n\n\nNonetheless, the cinematography ultimately delivers a [remarkable climax during the final arc](https://i.imgur.com/tbSOIrG.mp4). Returning motifs of lighting and eye color intertwine to complete the protagonists' emotional journey, while a shift in camera aspect ratio seemingly brings the denouement into reality. It's a triumphant finale that epitomizes why *World Dai Star*'s cinematography stands out as one of this year's finest.\n",

          "writeup": "A technique commonly seen in anime is the use of colorful and abstract background art to accentuate the intended mood of the scene. However, *Yamada-kun to Lv999 no Koi wo Suru* takes this practice to new heights by integrating it into nearly every scene, using over 60 instances within the first episode alone. While one might expect *Yamada-kun*'s cinematography would become repetitive as a result, it not only defies this expectation but also ironically forges a unique visual identity in the process. \n\n\nTo accomplish this, the majority of the backgrounds are simple yet unique compositions of [blocks of colors or patterns of shapes](https://imgur.com/a/CKvAH4y), effectively reflecting the emotions of the scenes. It's a successful formula that also flashes moments a step above, such as when creatively placing characters [within the beer they are drinking](https://i.imgur.com/StvxPda.mp4).\n\n\nBeyond the prevalent background inserts, *Yamada-kun*'s cinematography also employs overlaying visuals as part of its artistic direction. Scenes often feature [bright translucent shapes](https://imgur.com/a/PwzhsAx), [outlines of characters](https://imgur.com/a/36BrEQ4), and snippets from the show's footage [overlaid atop the shot](https://i.imgur.com/alT6eRm.mp4), serving as an additional means of communication with the audience. Examples such as those during the climax dramatically enhance the romantic story, but other uses, such as displaying written thoughts on screen, are less impactful. \n\n\nWhile effective, *Yamada-kun*'s cinematography primarily relies on these two techniques, resulting in moments without them to visually be a step down. However, when present, they weave together a season with imaginative editing, interesting shot selection, and emotive lighting that heightens its climatic moments and culminates in a touching finale.\n",

What truly distinguishes *Tsurune* is its consistency in working to make every shot add value, and every bit of lighting and shadow add realism and emotion to the world portrayed [2](https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/4eddbed1e232c3e2c1c66f6760e884fd.mp4). \n\n\nBeing a series focused on archery, every scene involving kyudo receives meticulous attention. The focus isn't solely on the shot itself, and the camera often shifts to underscore its broader significance or the characters' inner thoughts [3](https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/b35f13879ecb9fd57fb64a1608301b2b.mp4). This approach extends beyond the physical act of shooting; each arrow's impact resonates with the cast, offering profound insights or revelations.\n\n\nEven beyond the archery range, the show portrays the lives of the characters and their interactions in ways that go beyond simple emotions. Motifs [4](https://imgur.com/a/Iwfltqz) and lighting [5](https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/990cbe80fba3fcd2de8dc64714270af2.mp4) are utilized to depict the characters' moods, bridging them together in ways that words cannot. There are also a number of visual cues that help to breathe life into the world, some recurring such as close-up views and reflections of eyes, and some that simply add deep emotion to the scene in question.\n\n\nWhile the series has its share of slower moments that ease tension and thematic focus [6](https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/92122df8520ac9bf27e58fe47da7cef7.mp4), *Tsurune* never loses its heart in season two.

          "writeup": "One of 2023's most remarkable lighting works belongs to *Uma Musume: Pretty Derby - Road to the Top*. CygamesPictures masterfully floods scenes with bright and warm hues, particularly through sunlight [1](https://imgur.com/a/mjokIe8), to create picturesque shots. However, these effects transcend mere aesthetic appeal and play a crucial role in the storytelling. By establishing a recurrent day and night lighting motif [2](https://imgur.com/a/4j7BNS9), character emotions [3](https://imgur.com/a/htuTEY5) and arcs are effectively contrasted, heightening narrative tension and underscoring how through competition the protagonists better one another. \n\n\nCharacter contrasts are further emphasized through mise-en-scène. For instance, Admire Vega is often depicted closer to the ground and gazing up at the starry sky, while T.M. Opera O is consistently framed observing others from above [4](https://imgur.com/a/KhnQqKl). Often bridging these character polarities are close-up shots of hands [5](https://imgur.com/a/XSeeYmx ), but this technique also skillfully provides insight into individual feelings, particularly with Narita Top Road [6](https://imgur.com/a/dOl70So). \n\n\nAs a sports drama, the show also provides substantial attention to the racing scenes. Superb storyboarding and layouts unfold heart-pounding sequences, augmented by cinematic techniques such as dynamic depth of field [7](https://imgur.com/a/r5vdjnW), impactful low-angle shots [8](https://imgur.com/a/BBAKkhB ), and close-up profiles that highlight character grit and determination [9](https://imgur.com/a/7hYtphh). Unfortunately, these racing sequences also occasionally introduce conspicuous 3DCG, detracting from the overall artistic direction and audience engagement during climatic moments [10](https://imgur.com/a/1qdJCR8).

          "writeup": "Capitalizing on common tropes found in detective fiction, *Undead Girl Murder Farce* skillfully employs a variety of point-of-view and close-up camera angles to help land its tricky explanations. This is particularly evident during the recurring dialogue driven scenes, where interesting framing, such as the floating point-of-view angle from the main detective's detached head, maintains viewers engagement.\n\n\nAs a work of detective fiction, the show necessitates flashbacks to explore pivotal moments within the mystery. *Undead Girl Murder Farce* adopts a unique approach to this requirement through clever storyboarding, seamlessly integrating past events into present moments rather than revisiting them as redundant scenes. These distinct visuals help instill flavor into the dialogue-driven exposition and storytelling sequences. The fighting scenes, albeit infrequent, also benefit from this style of spliced cinematography, jumping from the fight itself to the other characters going over important story details. They provide ample opportunity for character interactions, with camera work and visuals enhancing the experience. \n\n\nThe series does, however, have a few flaws that are difficult to ignore. Shots are occasionally marred by compositing issues and distracting colorful borders within its frames. There are also some presentations of information during explanations and transitions between scenes that are of significantly lower quality compared to the rest of the show. Despite these significant detriments, the dedication to succinct storyboarding and unique interactions helps overcome the show's obstacles, ultimately delivering a captivating mystery.\n",

          "writeup": "The previous season of *Mushoku Tensei* showcased Studio Bind's cinematography prowess, especially during its numerous fight scenes. Appropriately, *Mushoku Tensei II: Isekai Ittara Honki Dasu*'s cinematic strengths can again primarily be found within its combat sequences. \n\n\nStandout moments include the dynamic camera work during the luster grizzly hunt [1](https://imgur.com/a/UBInHF5) and the impressive particle effects in Rudeus's duel with a red dragon [2](https://imgur.com/a/TlS80tV). However, this season's notable paucity of action confines these examples to early episodes. In replacement, the cinematography focuses on subtle details during non-combat episodes, using foreground and background objects to communicate character emotions [3](https://imgur.com/a/QesM8EO), and occasionally employing inviting and nuanced angles for fanservice [4](https://imgur.com/a/NdLcz22). While interesting, these strengths are inconsistently showcased. \n\n\nRegrettably, the second season also introduces technical issues in lighting and compositing [5](https://imgur.com/a/m5X06QE), resulting in flat shots and disjoined images due to inharmonious poor 3DCG integration. Moreover, visuals occasionally contradict narrative details, as seen in the aforementioned luster grizzly scene, where the bears are conspicuously white, despite the dialogue and establishing shot emphasizing that half should be discolored by mud [6](https://imgur.com/T26jc7C). \n\n\nWhile these may not be overt errors, these technical shortcomings, coupled with inconsistent cinematic strengths, prevent the show from fully captivating the audience. Fans of the series can still enjoy the season, but ultimately, *Mushoku Tensei II: Isekai Ittara Honki Dasu* falls short of its talented peers and rounds out this year's cinematography nominations.\n",

Viewers are consistently enthralled by the intricate techniques employed, resulting in a production worthy of recognition.\n\n\nOne of *[Oshi no Ko]*'s most notable cinematic achievements lies in its ability to transform nearly every scene into a visually captivating experience. Even mundane dialogue sequences are elevated through a range of techniques including compositing [1](https://imgur.com/a/jd4l39s), storyboarding [2](https://imgur.com/a/WrWbUaE), cross-cutting [3](https://imgur.com/a/sVx72yk), transitions [4](https://imgur.com/a/eJ8LZ1a), and symbolic closeups [5](https://imgur.com/a/IM2XuBM). Most striking, however, are the dramatic and romantic moments, which are intensified to palpable excitement through meticulous production choices. For instance, episode six's mounting tension is conveyed through progressively shorter cuts [6](https://i.imgur.com/kYroouJ.mp4) and nuanced lighting that contrasts past and present, leading to a breathtaking climax where soft bokeh lights drop to a cold harsh reality [7](https://imgur.com/a/qVChWfW). Such scenes are not alone, and moments of emotional turmoil are consistently enriched with diverse techniques such as blurring and dolly zooms [8](https://i.imgur.com/8mvSHKS.mp4) or beautiful bursts of rich color [9](https://i.imgur.com/M4f7cGq.mp4). \n\n\nA refined color palette is another consistent positive. Color theory is employed to not only create alluring compositions [10](https://imgur.com/a/N6sXpvz), but to also underscore emotional shifts when contrasted against the frequent desaturated scenes [11](https://imgur.com/a/NBaacBv). The attention to color extends to visual motifs, with the star featured within characters' vivid eyes, serving as a significant symbol of professional and emotional standing [12](https://imgur.com/a/LNeOSZh).

          "writeup": "Although *Vinland Saga Season 2* demonstrates competency in cinematography, the show struggles to distinguish itself among this year's nominees. It certainly isn't of poor quality, evident from its top ten ranking, and impressive compositing and establishing shots that breathes life into its world. However, as a whole, the cinematography does little to enhance the overall feeling of the series. The predictability of the camera direction, which simply shifts to whoever is speaking, coupled with the absence of scenery or effects, leaves the creativity feeling dull.\n\n\nThe best portions of the show's cinematography are limited to lighting and camera work within Thorfinn's dreams. Scenes are tinted with emotionally evocative hues and perspective is channeled through distinct angles, heightening the sense of rage and regret that led to the helplessness in Thorfinn's existential suffering. Through these strategies, the show places the audience within his metamorphosis, elevating the story as a whole. \n\n\nHowever, despite their accomplishment, the success of these two techniques are limited to these occasional oneiric segments. Reality within the show is rarely made striking, missing the framing, active camera work, or visual cues of other nominees this year.

While the occasional inconsistencies may arise, director Hirotaka Mori and the Production I.G team employ a diverse array of cinematic techniques to craft a captivating show. \n\n\nIn essence *Tengoku Daimakyou* intertwines two plotlines, “Heaven” and a post apocalyptic “Hell”, using visual cues to juxtapose the fundamental differences between them. Particularly striking is the lighting, where Heaven's artificial and harsh white light [1](https://imgur.com/a/7AqxqcI) starkly contrasts the natural tones [2](https://imgur.com/a/HEScgnS) and pitch-black nights [3](https://imgur.com/a/LNjZUCZ) of Hell. This contrast is exemplified by the frequent portrayal of claustrophobic and methodical ceilings [4](https://imgur.com/a/dUxld9V) versus a wide-open sky crisscrossed by power lines [5](https://imgur.com/a/4C7hc3q). Furthermore, camera work and composition also contribute to this dichotomy, switching between Heaven's static shots and simple settings [6](https://imgur.com/a/ojOYvPi) to Hell's dynamic sequences, diverse environments, and varied camera angles [7](https://imgur.com/a/PUkXTFx). \n\n\nThe importance of visuals also extends to the show's rich symbolism. Mirrors reflect characters' self-identity crises [8](https://imgur.com/a/Sj1YViV), while themes of family, separation, and blood are told through the recurring color red [9](https://imgur.com/a/500BH2K). Strong storyboarding plays a key role in emphasizing these significant visuals, whether it be during action or dramatic sequences or when augmenting the superb animation [10](https://i.imgur.com/80Kp39G.mp4) and OST. \n\n\nIn total these visuals and cinematic techniques heighten *Tengoku Daimakyou*'s mystery, and allow it to skillfully play on the audience's attention. Important characters are introduced as ordinary, visual cues are misleadingly veiled, and key revelations are cleverly hidden in plain sight. It's an intricate storytelling style that's only possible by the cinematography's unwavering commitment to maintaining the narrative's mystery.\n",

At the same time, it makes clever use of tracking [1](https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/2efe9421423bf38461b7af09ccaeeb21.mp4), lighting [2](https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/ccb4d7dcc2d4e5a78726017a4f138337.mp4), obscured backgrounds [3](https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/3c27b04b858b24aded2301b571b85091.mp4), among other techniques to always keep the choreography clear for the viewer. When the gritty fist fights escalate into dazzling visual effects displays, the cinematography likewise fluidly shifts into highlighting the suspense and the enormity of the explosions while still keeping the action clean and readable within the effects [4](https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/f7c8db47eed4f06c9a316ca5fb22f119.mp4).\n\n\nAlthough the series is mainly focused on action, it also demonstrates astoundingly emotional cinematography in some dramatic scenes through its meticulous framing and intimate shot composition [5](https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/36149b568f44796636ff5b45da069bcc.mp4).\n\n\nHowever, these achievements are marred by a significant lack of consistency and no overall vision spanning the season. For example, a sliding depth of field effect is used in some emotional scenes but not repeated in near-identical circumstances, and then that same effect is later used in the banter of a fight scene with a very different tone. Several clusters of episodes, most notably the first arc, do establish persistent patterns and visual motifs but the series never holds onto them for long.\n\n\nOverall, its inconsistency and lack of singular vision inhibits its cinematic maturity. Nevertheless, *Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2* undeniably has some of the best individual cinematography of the year, confidently placing it within 2023's top ten.\n",

More than just a feast for the eyes, the aesthetic compatibility-or lack thereof-of the visual effects surrounding each member of the band conveys their musical synchronization [2](https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/67a82e8e9ee9e878f2ef391f40f99c9d.mp4), or certain effects can flow from one player into the other in tandem with how the parts of the song build into each other. Most importantly, *Blue Giant* handles this aesthetic with *restraint* - not diving fully into the vivid colors and style breaks until the band truly reaches their musical best, and then rationing it out bit-by-bit over each performance so the film's visuals keep on crescendoing towards the climax.",

The formless, experimental style of abstract animation does not often give much ground for cinematography to elevate a narrative that is formed only from the art itself. Which makes it all the more shocking and brilliant how Mirai Mizue's short film *Eternity* is innovative abstract animation art built entirely out of cinematography. The first 5 minutes are not unlike a typical Mizue short: a small template of recurring visual assets edited into four kaleidoscopic moving tableaus. But then the set of four tableaus repeats with some visual variation and elaboration... and again... and again. Each of the four cycles adds variation and increased complexity that crescendos into a beautiful climax, all without a single bit of story or new animation. It is a fascinatingly novel and thought-provoking showcase of pure cinematography that has never been seen before. ",

There's quite a bit of creative framing in the lead-up to the fight [1](https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/576ba579b2ee8fff49633dcc1613258e.mp4), including establishing a comic-book style panel frame rule [2](https://i.imgur.com/TjiaAZE.png) and then humorously breaking it mere moments later [3](https://i.imgur.com/8i33UZy.png).

This is an attractive stylistic choice, but what's even more important is how it enables the storyboarding to cut between settings on an impact and smash a character through multiple layers of settings while always keeping visual clarity.

This episode is where those themes reach their final conclusion: that childhood and adulthood need not be so different after all [1](https://i.imgur.com/EYDDger.gif), as well as breaking down Tachibana's misplaced notions of what defines an adult and who she allows herself to be.

The first area is largely looking at the compositions of a soundtrack in isolation, judging their compositional strength, instrumentation, mixing, expressions of musical genres and variety. The other critical area considered was to look at the context of the show. How effectively does a show use their soundtrack? What themes and leitmotifs does the OST have; does the soundtrack fit not only the tone but the pace of the scene; or were there motifs that developed over the course of the show or movie? The best OSTs of the year elevated already strong shows to genuine excellence and were crucial for creating the most memorable moments of the year.  *Trigun Stampede*’s awe-inspiring range of instrumentation and thematic depth, blending orchestral grandeur with western influences seamlessly is a phenomenally composed OST, even among the best of the year. *Tengoku Daimakyou* and *Arknights* follow closely with their remarkable compositional complexity, the former employing emotional melodies to enhance the show's poignant moments and the latter impressing with dynamic character themes.   Another common strength of the nominees this year is in their effective utilization during the calmer, less dramatic moments. *Vinland Saga*’s strong instrumentation is used to create a fresh, idyllic atmosphere for the series. *Onimai*’s tracks feature consistent themes and leitmotifs that play an important role in highlighting Mahiro’s growth. Meanwhile *D4DJ All Mix* brings a fun and groovy pop-inspired soundtrack that gives every scene a strong cheerful energy.",

And while the genre of the soundtrack is unconventional, its usage is quite straightforward and rarely emphasizes anything outside of what is already clear from the dialogue or visuals.

The soundtrack excels in its versatility, featuring over 60 tracks ensures easy adaptation to different scenes, with the well-crafted selection of tracks notably preventing abrupt scene transitions. \n\n\nA drawback of the large quantity of tracks comes in the form of noticeable overlaps in the soundtrack, with a substantial number of themes having multiple variations. Certain patterns become a staple of *Onii-chan wa Oshimai!*'s musical palette such as the xylophone tones, distant horns or quiet, energetic strings. However, this approach  provides a comforting and familiar backdrop to the series.\n\n\nIn both dramatic and comedic scenes, each track displays impressive attention to detail. The use of a leitmotif that evolves with Mahiro adds an engaging layer of depth to the supporting musical narrative, and the comedic tracks are not just fragmented musical ideas ‘mickey-mousing' the on-screen motions. Even in the soundtrack's atonal compositions, there is still musical integrity with melodic and rhythmic structures. Additionally, the introduction of timbres associated with childhood, such as the recorder and toy piano, add a charming and nostalgic dimension to the soundtrack. Overall, with its thoughtful composition and attention to detail, this soundtrack stands out as a commendable addition to the slice of life genre.",

It makes heavy use of synthetic sounds, strings, and percussive elements that create both effective mood-setting pieces as well as very intense and dynamic character themes. These are prevalent in tracks like the high tempo, percussion heavy ‘Blaze' theme or the tense and haunting flute melody prominent in FrostNova's titular ‘Perish in Frost'.\n \n\nMore than being compositionally outstanding, one of the biggest strengths of the OST is how well utilized the tracks are. During the early episodes the OST is often introduced early in a scene and gradually swells in volume, which is why it is so successful at setting the mood. The soundtrack also knows to step back during dialogue scenes, which allows it to come in at the most pivotal moments to underscore critical emotional shifts.\n\n\nHowever, one criticism of the soundtrack is a slight overuse of a couple tracks. The “sad piano” track ‘Reminiscence' specifically is reused often enough that it becomes stale by the end of the show. Despite the reuse of a few tracks, and how ‘loud' and intense many of the tracks are, the variety largely prevents the soundtrack from feeling overpowering or stale.

From traditional orchestral pieces with grandiose pianos and strings during emotional moments to western influenced acoustic guitars and whistling during their travels through the desert, the soundtrack fills the environment and atmosphere perfectly to provide a natural and homely feel.\n\n\nThe care put into the work of Studio Orange and composer Tatsuya Kato's five and a half year long production of *Trigun Stampede* is particularly clear in its musical scoring.

The series' shift of locations in place and time throughout the cour allow for interesting variations in the instrumentation and tone featured within tracks; from electronic and bouncy elements to lighter keys-focused compositions, often complementing the more sci-fi-esque laboratory sequences as well as the post-apocalyptic adventures of the main duo. Their previous ventures with *Ping Pong the Animation*'s heavily rhythmic and beat-driven scores, along with the more nuanced and gentle approach through *Heike Monogatari*'s work clearly inspired and assisted in creating such a strong balance across the entire soundtrack here. \n\n\nParticularly of note are the emotional strengths of the score, with every significant scene in the show featuring a touching melody, or often extending the length of individual tracks to fully encompass a scene. The soft synth notes and effect usages especially bring a really personal and human perspective to their scenes, helping convey the often tragic and painful emotions of the cast through an incredibly effective but not overly encroaching score. The integration across different types of moments is also superb, elevating the thriller and action setpieces, while approaching the comedic and emotional aspects of the series with much care. The final result of these factors leaves a strong impression, a truly special sonic image for the series, adding yet another stellar soundtrack to Kensuke Ushio's already remarkable discography.",

The soundtrack has a pretty diverse range of instrumentation, primarily characterized by woodwinds and delicate strings that give the series a renaissance period flair. One of its strongest instances occurs during Episode 3 where the opening (OP) and ending (ED) themes serve as insert songs, particularly resonating with young Rudeus during his tender date with Sara. During moments of tension and action, the compositions incorporate pronounced percussive elements and harsh sounding strings, such as during Rudeus's heroic rescue of the Counter Arrows. \n\n\nHowever, while the tracks themselves are quite complex and layered, their usage often falls flat. Tracks blend together and don't have a strong identity and the strengths the OST does have feel somewhat disjointed and sparse. While the soundtrack fits together with a ‘renaissance' soundscape, it often sounds forgettable and lacks any deeper compositional or thematic depth. More often than not the soundtrack just hits a general tone appropriate for a scene but it did little to stand out compared to the genuinely transformative impact of the best OST's of the year. \n",

          "writeup": "The soundtrack of the series *Kidou Senshi Gundam: Suisei no Majo* boasts an impressive array of compositional variety and complexity, immersing listeners in a world of meaningful themes. The first cour captivates with endless creativity, fusing traditional orchestral timbres with a pulsating electronica undercurrent. For the majority of the first cour, *Kidou Senshi Gundam: Suisei no Majo* uses a system of ‘film scoring' - tracks composed after the visuals are animated, which is highly atypical in the anime industry. This allowed for the subtle development of musical content alongside the action. The ebb and flow of action sequences are reflected in the orchestration, and the physical strain placed on the gundam pilots as they ascend the Permet scores paralleled by soaring operatic vocals. \n\n\nHowever, the second cour experiences a slight decline in creativity with the noticeable repetition of some tracks, most notably \"The Witch From Mercury.\" These overused pieces, once detached from their original scenes, lose some of their impact and create a fragmented listening experience.\n\n\nDespite this setback, the tracks still maintain the same sense of expansiveness and unmatched orchestration. The soundtrack's masterful handling of themes, from the overtly ironic 'Happy Birthday' motif to the variations in “Elan's theme” for Elan and his doppelgangers, ensure a memorable musical journey.",

Now with the shift of pace in *Vinland Saga Season 2*, a new assortment of tracks complement the varying themes and dramatic elements of the season. \n\n\nWhile many of the main melodies of the series are still present, they are expanded upon through a change in instrumentation priorities which reflect the change in setting. The grand spreads with the pronounced drums and brass instrumentation are still present, however a shift from the electronic layers to a more pronounced usage of wind and string instruments results in a more somber and gentle tone for this season.\n\n\nThe thematic significance of individual tracks is another notable feature of the show. Many of the tracks connect to specific characters, but are also utilized alongside different philosophies and various messages prominently featured within the narrative. Returning tracks from the first season are tastefully repurposed to provide new flavor in context alongside the new material; however, they appear a bit too frequently. Regardless, the integration of the soundtrack into different sequences - whether they are intense fights or retrospective character moments - leaves a strong and emotional impression that helps convey the important aspects of each scene, truly creating experiences worth remembering.",

          "writeup": "*Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2* starts off extremely strong with the Hidden Inventory arc, featuring a fantastic variety of soundscapes and thematically interesting tracks. This arc uses many jazz set pieces for the frantic and engaging action scenes, and does a fantastic job at slowing it down to provide a moody and charming atmosphere at the school for the more laidback slice-of-life scenes. To accompany the deliberative scoring, the sound design and mixing during this arc is excellent at blending day-to-day actions at a moment's notice into the soundscape and musical beats of the tracks.\n\n\nDuring the Shibuya Incident arc, things start to get much more chaotic in the show as well as the soundtrack. The soundtrack starts to get a lot messier and uses varied musical styles to establish chaos on the extreme scales, which has good intentions but is not always executed well. Much of the instrumentation feels like it is lacking in its melodic composition due to the way it is tossed around in parts of the arc. Without strong themes or ideas being communicated many of the more unique tracks are lost to the wayside. However, many of the dark, dreary, and disturbed tracks that play through the latter half, when the heroes' despair is at an all time high, really enforce that feeling of hopelessness. Meanwhile, the battle tracks are appropriately fit to the chaos and magnificence of the fight scenes, providing them a nice structure to work with.\nOverall, this is a fantastic soundtrack with a few issues that lessen its overall impact.",

          "writeup": "*[Oshi no Ko]*'s soundtrack delivers a mostly standard experience throughout, with occasional flair added by some unique choices in instrumentation. While not exceptional, the soundtrack manages to elevate the show's dramatic atmosphere with heady and suspenseful percussion and keyboards. The unconventional use of noises, such as a tape recorder's stuttering, a persistent cowbell ring, or droning static at the end of Akane's downward spiral accentuate the show's more serious moments. Meanwhile the comedic moments have solid musical delivery primarily thanks to great timing, and the laid back scenes occasionally add the charming touch of the elusive xylophone.\n\n\nHowever, there are occasional moments of tonal whiplash from the insistent ED song transitions cutting into the end of the episodes, disrupting dramatic moments for ironic moments of comedy. Mixing problems further exacerbate each of these issues as the music often fails to balance with the vocals or sound effects, where the inconsistent volume levels hinder immersion. \n\n\nAi's leitmotif is established in episode one but its overuse throughout the series diminishes its impact. The lack of subtlety in its application becomes apparent, robbing the emotional weight of pivotal scenes, with a notable exception in its use when Akane takes on the persona of Ai underscoring the completeness of her imitation. Though a fairly standard slice-of-life soundtrack, the unique instrumentation and upbeat comedic timings make it a noteworthy entry.",

The scene begins with textbook call and response; Fumino's invitation is represented by alternating, stepwise piano thirds, and Mitsumi’s reluctant reply and ambitions of the city life by a muted synth, reminiscent of subway jingles. Fumino's reassurance is likewise paralleled by the ascending sequence of piano broken chords.\n\nFrom :45 the soundtrack shifts from this instrumental back and forth to Mitsumi's perspective. The cool timbre of the subway synth melody, with its gut-wrenching chromatic twists, is slowly eroded by the entry of warm, texturally dense strings, quoting the same motif from Fumino’s invite. This motif eventually blossoms into its own counter-melody when Mitsumi eats the gyoza. That musical progression is heightened by the absolute minimalism of the scene: the held, static shot of Mitsumi and absence of dialogue. Finally, synths disappear entirely and the piano and string lines merge. The previously distinct call and response dissolves once Mitsumi realizes that Fumino has her back. ",

They cannot determine “what” they say, as the script is entirely dependent on the original creator and screenwriters. They have little influence on “how” they say their lines, as the delivery is something that the original creator, director, and sound directors all work together to decide. The one thing that voice actors can control is “how well” they deliver their lines. It is the singular pursuit of finding the ultimate sound in every moment. No other aspect of anime production hinges as much on the skill expression of the individual, and voice actors and actresses dedicate the entirety of their craft to giving voice to the voiceless characters.  This year, the jury once again faced a daunting task. They sifted through the hundreds of performances from anime in the past year, and even shows that started in years prior, to find the ones that drew closest to that ultimate sound. In this process, dozens of prospective nominees were discussed and evaluated over a wide variety of criteria, from technical skill to emotional appeal and more. They reminded themselves that the voice acting performance as a whole is more than the efforts of a single individual, but encompasses everyone involved in the narrative, audio, and overall direction of the anime. Every single nominee has earned their spot through rigorous assessment or profound public appeal, each a testament to the power and impact of voice acting in anime.",

When it comes to pure spunk, Anisphia is unmatched - her infectious smile and whimsical antics are matched by a voice full of clarity and enthusiasm. Senbongi takes dialogue and elevates it with her lively pace and lilting pitch, drawing all ears to her in every scene, whether rescuing Euphilia from Al's NTR plot or sending her off into the sky on a prototype broom at her peril. As the show progresses and things become dire, Anisphia becomes more serious, subdued, and vulnerable, while Senbongi matches that energy with controlled, careful breathing and a downward shift in tone.\n\n\nIt's not all roses for our bundle of sunshine. Anisphia's script contains a mountain of exposition, from explaining the inner workings of magic to outlining the political turmoil and strife of the kingdom. These exposition scenes are a chore to listen to as Senbongi prioritizes clarity and information over expressiveness and entertainment. In her lower-energy scenes, Anisphia's lack of that charming energy is telling, and there's nothing to fill in that tangible hole in the performance. Despite these shortcomings in the latter half of the show, Anisphia's high-flying and explosive performance from the start is brilliant and lands her a solid placement in the rankings.\n",

Takehito Koyasu is a familiar voice indeed, but his performance as Uncle takes us to the unfamiliar territory of completely unhinged voice acting. The peaks and valleys of Uncle's comedically unstable emotions are met with intensely visceral voice acting; in some scenes, you can just make out the spittle that's coming out of Takehito's mouth. His screams of anguish and depraved laughs are dialed to the max, absolutely selling the comedic elements of the show single-handedly. Many of the jokes in *Isekai Ojisan* are predicated on the contrast between Uncle talking like a normal human being and Uncle talking like a rabid monkey. It's not just a one-note performance either, as Takehito uses an arsenal of diction, pacing, mimicry, breathing, and sometimes just screaming nonsense to come up with new and hilarious ways to be Uncle.\n\n\nTherefore, it's somewhat fitting that consistency is not Uncle's forte. Outside of the comedic scenes, the few expository scenes where Uncle is simply laying out background information are dull in comparison. Takehito's accentuated moments of intensity often leaves the dialogue around these moments uninteresting as well. You can't blame the old man Uncle for not being at his best 100% of the time, and he lands at an impressive second place in rankings.\n",

Taku uses his breathing, pacing, and tone to deliver and switch effortlessly between these aspects of Tsugaru, weaving together a sound that is uniquely him. While his tone is normally airy and detached, in fight scenes Taku brings out a more grounded, guttural sound, a testament to how well he adapts his performance to fit the scene. The rakugo-style performances are the cherry on-top, the height of all the elements of Taku's acting. They require precise pacing, intentional tone-shifts, and controlled breathing to maximize the theatrical flair.\n\n\nIn spite of all this, Tsugaru is simply just a one-man show. Outside of his trademark aloof and flamboyant attitude, Tsugaru is lacking in emotional delivery, especially for negative emotions like sadness or anger. He does hint at a deep regret and vengeance at times, but it's not something well-conveyed either in the story or in the performance. Without that added depth and nuance, his unique drawl and speech alone is not enough to hit that next level of performance. He's a one-trick pony and, while his singular act is interesting and nuanced, a headliner can only be a fresh sensation once.\n",

There is not a single moment where Mitsumi sounds anything but her earnest, dorky self. Her carefully crafted pitch profile with a touch of Noto dialect is kept consistently throughout different settings, conversations, moods, and energy. Even when Mitsumi is giving exposition, a time where many voice actors and voice directors prioritize vocal clarity above all else, Kurosawa is acting it out and making sure it sounds as Mitsumi as possible, being true to her character and letting her character do the talking.\n\n\nAnd the character certainly talks, because Mitsumi has some of the most colorful interactions, conversations, and monologues of this year. From her daydreaming of becoming a future mayor to her confrontational moments in class and relationship drama, Mitsumi not only experiences but puts to words her joy and sorrow, her regret and convictions. When Mitsumi goes home for summer break, her voice melts into the relaxed and casual country speak to show an entirely new side of herself, reserved for her old friends and the viewers.

The real power of Youmiya's performance is her ability to convey Yamada's emotions through vocal nuances of infectious cheerfulness, flirtation, and intense sincerity. This is particularly a strength for a character who is meant to be ambiguous in a narrative depicted from Ichikawa's perspective.\n\n\nWhile credit is due to the script for its subtle visual cues, Hina Youmiya consistently demonstrates astute decision-making in her portrayal. Her consistent use of small sub-sentence vocal fluctuations and breathwork hint at Yamada's feelings and emotional state. For example, her voice tightens when she is devious, and her voice gets higher-pitched and stilted to convey forced cheerfulness when she is hurt and tries to mask it.\n\n\nUnfortunately, Hina Youmiya doesn't have as much of an opportunity to shine early on in the season; Anna does not talk much at the start outside of disjointed utterances and being silly. However, as Anna narratively grows into her deuteragonist role, her lines become significantly more impactful and interesting. One standout example being when she is over at Ichi's house in episode 12. She is pretty flustered and excited and her voice reflects that. She breaks and stumbles through her words, sometimes changing tone slightly in the middle of a sentence in a somewhat awkward way that feels really fitting. \n\n\nHer ability to convey Yamada's feelings through subtle vocal nuances and smart decisions demonstrates a level of skill and insight that makes her an integral part of the series' narrative tapestry.\n",

Kana's ambitious side has a marked lack of nasality while her flirty tones dial into that head voice. The fluidity of Han's transitions between these aspects of Kana in the same scene, sometimes in the same sentence, is an impressive feat.\n\n\nOn top of this, child Kana is an entire section of her performance that is notably different, bratty and immature, using a lot of nasality to create that precocious diva energy. It's impressive to see how much of that energy Megumi adapts to all aspects of Kana's teenage voice; you can sometimes hear a bit of the 10-year old inside come out in moments of smug, sass, and astonishment.\n\n\nAlas, Kana is only a newcomer idol, and where the performance fails to shine is with the negative emotions. Every other emotion is performed with creativity and gusto, so her more subdued lines are notably less interesting and gripping.

Having been less than a year since season one, and even less time in-universe, Anya's performance has not only maintained the childlike energy and wonder that drew listeners to her role the first time, but has managed to improve in both breadth and depth. Anya's peanut-sized growth in the series has afforded Tanezaki moments where Anya forms complete thoughts and sentences. Scenes like baiting Loid to buy souvenirs or helping Yor out at the fight on the deck show glimpses of what a more mature and focused Anya would sound like which is incredibly interesting and fun.\n\n\nThat being said, the limitations on Anya's dialogue remains a limiting factor on the overall performance. Outside of these rare scenes, Anya talks in choppy sentences without much nuance or depth, and her emotional state is as shallow as it is unstable. This necessitates Tanezaki's simple and reserved approach to the character, and forgoes the chances of hearing Anya give words to any deep emotion or complex feeling. Maybe down the line, when Anya has grown up more, we can hear the full potential of this budding performance.\n",

          "writeup": "Reprising his role, Uemura Yuuto does a great job of capturing Thorfinn's evolution as a character since the events of *Vinland Saga*'s first season. His portrayal as Thorfinn leads to some of the most powerful and compelling scenes of the entire year. During the show's apex scene in Episode 22, Uemura channels a bit of Thorfinn's voice from the previous season via a gritty, harsh snarl with a hint of young energy and profound anger. The scene is incredibly well delivered. Thorfinn comes across compellingly angry, forceful, and *raw*. Similarly, in episode nine, Thorfinn's screams during his nightmares are delivered so harshly, with a sound of authentic panic making the scene genuinely haunting and doing justice to Thorfinn's tortured, deeply traumatized soul.\n\n\nHowever, in almost every other scene, Thorfinn sounds like a shell of himself, lacking in just about everything that makes a voice acting performance memorable: emotion, energy, determination, range, breathing, and pacing. In season one, Thorfinn's voice had more of a unique profile to it with his iconic rage goblin energy but has less of a consistent vocal presence in the show. But despite this change, Uemura Yuuto's performance adds significant depth to Thorfinn's character, particularly in key moments that resonate deeply with viewers, ensuring that his portrayal remains a memorable aspect of *Vinland Saga*.\n",

          "writeup": "The legendary Rie Takahashi does a good job of making Ai's personality really shine through in *Oshi no Ko* despite her limited runtime. Takahashi skillfully embodies Ai's overly positive and cheerful demeanor, delivering her lines with exaggerated enthusiasm that befits her artificial idol persona. Breathing is key here, and Takahashi's minimal breathing while doing Ai's public face and integrating breathing when Ai's facade slips is a great subtle shift that adds a degree of depth to Ai's character. Her articulation is immaculate and the almost musical way she works through her range is stunning. Ai's final scene provides a great contrast to the rest of her more light-hearted performance.  \n\n\nUnfortunately, the lack of impactful emotions like anger, sadness, or even genuine joy is stark compared to the other nominees in this category. Rie Takahashi is a very talented voice actor who consistently delivers standout performances, but this time she is largely limited by the script. Ai isn't stoic, but she didn't quite have these moments that made her feel fully nuanced beyond this single facet of her character, her artificial cheerfulness and facade. Despite Takahashi's few brilliant moments as Ai, the brevity of the role gives the category's more dynamic and nuanced top contenders too much head start to overcome.\n",

          "writeup": "*Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2* defies expectations in all sorts of ways, and Junya Enoki's performance as Yuuji Itadori is no exception. Yuuji has a fun and engaging speaking voice with a hint of nasality that makes him sound like he's always having fun and living in the moment. The early scenes in the Shibuya arc showcase his bright cheeriness bringing light to the encroaching darkness. \n\n\nHowever, what really pushes Junya's performance over the top is his absolute transformation over the course of the season. Yuuji faces insurmountable obstacles, loses irreplaceable friends, and commits unforgivable mistakes. His cheerfulness is chipped away, his voice loses that spark and vitality, and he ends the season as a vengeful and broken husk of who he was at the start. The crowning moment of the performance is Yuuji's final words to Mahito, where he resigns himself to who he has become and chillingly says the words that the Yuuji of the past would never think of uttering.\n\n\nYuuji's performance is not without its shortcomings, however. While his transformation is apparent on-screen, it's not entirely reflected in the voicework, and the transition period doesn't have a lot of dialogue. His anguished screams do not do justice to the massive character shift that's occurred - there is a lot of depth and complexity that is missing between the two ends of the spectrum. His placement in this year's awards is a reflection of the higher peaks that this performance can reach as Junya explores the full potential of Yuuji, irreversibly and forever changed.\n",

Tomo Aizawa stands out among them for being a departure from the precise, controlled, and calculated acting that Takahashi has become known for. Tomo is the exact opposite of this - uncontrolled, rough around the edges, and passionately following through her every emotion and impulse. Takahashi hits every element of Tomo’s wild expressions with energy and enthusiasm, all while developing a lower pitch profile than her usual roles to hit that peak tomboy energy. The addition of a low, throaty growl to her normally clear articulation is a feast for the ears. In Tomo’s more subdued and moodier scenes, Takahashi further elevates her acting by emphasizing her breathing and making Tomo sound breathless and taken aback. It is without question that if a voice actor could be nominated for multiple performances, Tomo Aizawa would be among the top performances of this year.",

By harmonizing these visual elements with a great song, this 90-second showreel is turned into an experience that to many is worth analyzing critically as much as the show itself.  Even outside of the ten nominees, 2023 made for an exceptional year. Left over from last year *Urusei Yatsura (2022)*’s second OP “Ai wa Namuchu” has one of the best songs of the year and is paired with highly entertaining visuals. The year then opened with the cold touch of Winter, as *Vinland Saga*’s “Paradox” and *Hikari no Ou*’s “Usotsuki” showcase the sorrow that their otherwise gritty historical settings contain. Spring blossomed with *Skip and Loafer*’s infectious OP “Mellow” while Summer provided warmth with *My Happy Marriage*’s beautiful OP “Watashi no Shiawase na Kekkon”. Most unfortunate out of all the OPs that didn’t get nominated, *Undead Unluck*’s “01” just barely misses out on a nominee slot despite visuals that flow smoothly and are tightly timed with the song, a result of the strong competition in the category this year.  Competition was equally fierce within the ten that made the final cut. Ultimately, *Heavenly Delusion*’s “Innocent Arrogance” managed to ascend above the rest with its breathtaking visuals brilliantly displaying the series’ vast post-apocalyptic world and underlying mysteries.",

Masaaki Yuasa utilizes Ado's harmonious vocals in a call-and-response fashion to craft a kinetic piece of energy that captures the charms of the Forgers through unique timing, shapely silhouettes, and constant transitions.\n\n\n“Kura Kura” plays into the round-like shapes of Kazuaki Shimada's designs through emphasis on using their silhouettes. The flash-fight segments utilize negative spacing and arc motions to showcase how the designs move in action sequences. The screentone composite sequences create visual contrast through trading bubbles between the background and foreground elements, which adheres to the eccentricity of the Forgers by playing around with their shape design. These stylized segments detract a bit from the OP's appeal due to its minimalist backgrounds and coloring that lack the same visual acuity of its charming movement and perpetual transitions.\n\n\nAnother strong point of the OP is the persistent walk cycle introduced and revisited throughout the OP– that works to hook the viewer with not only the public family dynamic of the Forgers, but also a slight homage to Yuasa's own *Crayon Shin-Chan* OP with a similarly atypical family. All in all, *Spy × Family Season 2*'s “Kura Kura” remains a fantastic deluge of endearing character movement affixed to snappy music.",

From Oden's past to the first glimpse of Gear 5, the intro shows the long history of the Wano Country Arc. Luffy bursting through the confines of the circular character kicks off one of the most energetic and creative OP sequences of the year. \n\n\nLuffy falling through the sky, laughing and overflowing with charisma, cements the tone as merry and carefree. The sequence with him and Yamato is stunningly animated and composited, using smears and blobby effects emblematic of Wano and Gear 5. And the montage that follows is simple in concept and remarkable in execution. Extending the central circle motif, each shot is arranged such that a brief glimpse is all that is necessary to take in the scene. The sheer variety of shots is impressive, but this careful composition creates a stream of newly iconic shots that are perfectly readable and impactful.\n\n\nBookending the OP with the writing table and a collage of Wano clips further highlights the long journey of *One Piece* as a series. The largest drawback of “Saikou Toutatsuten” is naturally the sheer amount of time it spends during these bookends. They do leave a lot of potential on the table compared to other, consistently strong showings. Even so, the creative concept and exciting execution of “Saikou Toutatsuten” make for an opening that is fun and exciting for fans and newcomers alike.\n",

The characters are very expressive and energetic from their facial expressions to movement, which given the animation quality of this opening, provides many goofy and fun moments throughout the OP. \n\n\nThe backgrounds are great, with the pixelated, video game aesthetics littered throughout the opening to the dark windswept night in the latter half, with fruit flying through the air and the hammering of the moon. Even when the backgrounds are more muted with a blank canvas, they give little patterns to spice it up a bit. The song is fantastic, with the two main characters singing back and forth as they run through this chaotic game world. The synchronization of the music to the visuals is great, and the OP has a nice pattern of transitioning between beat breaks that is visually and sonically pleasing. The transition when Mahiro swipes her arm across the screen or when she swipes her hand across the screen are just two examples of impressive editing and directing. Musically, the instrumentation comes off as poppy and fun, with a happy-go-lucky charm which matches the goofiness of the entire OP.\n\n\nUnfortunately, the lack of structure between the real world and video game world is a noticeable drawback, as it seems a bit disjointed in regards to the show. However, with an infectious energy, a joyous song, and fantastic production values, “Identeitei Meltdown” executes enough of the important aspects spectacularly to remain as one of the strongest openings of the year.",

For a series that borrows from goth and punk aesthetics to signify a rebellious uprising in a world of outlawed Otaku, this OP fits like a glove.\n\n\nBetween its retro 2000s coloring, expressive imagery, shredding guitars, and surprisingly soft vocals, Magical Destroyers establishes a unique aesthetic and tone. The OP pulls the viewer in for the first section, right before completely breaking down in the second half in what can only be described as pure anarchy. Much like how the characters in the show break the rules and become increasingly unhinged to achieve their goals, this OP also breaks expectations by deliberately collapsing into madness about halfway through. The song transforms into a wall of aggressive, almost oppressive noise and the visuals morph into a mixed-media onslaught of bewitching and incomprehensible imagery. The stylish and evocative mood at the start and its sudden transformation into chaos and anarchy make the OP one of the most memorable and unique of the year.\n\n\nIt's hard to deny that “Magical Destroyer” stands out in more ways than one. Although the abstract nature of the breakdown and the aggressive transformation in the song can be off putting to some, its daring choice to be highly subversive makes a strong impression, with the captivating imagery preceding it elevating the experience even further.",

The initial distortion on the vocals coupled with peppy sounds of the electric guitar help to establish not only the rough environment of the world, but also that the experiences of the characters in it are mostly positive. When that distortion is eventually removed, the joy that is the essence of the OP is further accentuated.\n\n\nOne of the standout sections is the street dancing segment, where multiple strong elements come together. The electric guitar shredding joyously combines with mass dancing in the background and falling leaves that serve as confetti to create a party-like atmosphere, while Akira and his friends provide a more individual focus as they lip sync and move in genuine, fairly simplistic ways that sync with the music.\n\n\nAn issue the OP does have is how visually cluttered it can be at times. It can occasionally be difficult to figure out where to focus, and in some cases there are hordes of copied zombies that aren't rendered the same as the rest of the visuals. Even with those minor flaws though, “Song of the Dead” is a stellar OP and possibly the most fun a zombie apocalypse has ever been.  ",

The core impression of “Brave” is Frieren's emotional state and her bonds with party members, new and old. Focusing on Frieren's solitude at the start then slowly introducing the rest of the cast matches Frieren's newly reflective attitude.\n\n\nThe weaker segments of “Brave” are spent chiefly in minimalist settings: plain skies, faded backgrounds, and completely white backdrops. These simplistic tendencies lead to characters standing or sitting around, making the most basic references to details about the show or characters. Small gestures towards Fern and Stark's backstories, Himmel's feelings, or future characters leave little impact compared to other stronger OPs this year. In addition, many of these scenes don't feel like they contribute to a strong whole. Similarly, the music and visuals often clash in tone and the different aesthetics throughout feel disjointed and aimless.\n\n\nRegardless, “Brave” is at its best in moments when it can show off its excellent character designs, color designs, and animation. Frieren sleeping is strong in style alone, where her revealing her mana is a fun burst of animation. The montage shows off a variety of animated character moments while the final stitch of the two parties is a touching thematic note to end on. The inconsistent nature of “Brave” holds it back, but the strength of its individual elements is undeniable. ",

The influence of Weilin Zhang's direction is felt in every corner of the opening, from gorgeous art direction to freeform designs allowing for blobby smears. This idiosyncratic aesthetic strikes a delicate balance of poignancy and whimsy, a testament to its strong understanding of the show's appeal. \n\n\nElevated by its brilliant structure and use of motifs, “innocent arrogance” presents an experience that is nothing short of breathtaking. The instrumentation with its wistful piano at the start is immediately captivating, before it continues to build on and develop throughout. The compositing creates a complementary blend of lighting, color, and background art. Together with BiSH's intimate vocals, they form a beautiful reverie as the characters wander across the empty world. This is then shattered to great effect with the shift to night in the chorus, where the frantic vocals and visceral animation with Kiruko becoming detached from their outlines come together to capture a heightened sense of fear and paranoia. The impactful contrast of light and dark, nestled with nuggets of narrative significance, is impressive to no end.\n\n\nAn exceptional opening draws you in like no other, and “innocent arrogance” is a masterclass in how to achieve such a tonally resonant experience. The marriage of song and visuals is immaculate and is a treat for both the eye and ear. Captivating from start to finish, “innocent arrogance” reaches its destination as the best of the year.",

This trend runs steady until the beat breaks down at about the halfway point, where the music and visuals drastically pick up and everything gets a lot more energetic. Within the short amount of time that all of this occurs, character dynamics and personalities are wonderfully established. Gojo is overly dramatic, laid-back, goofy, and playful, while Geto comes off as a lot less casual, more thoughtful and somber, but still spirited in the group's dynamic. The animation of these characters is also very expressive and fluid, with the fight scene that occurs as they are falling down the side of the building, especially standing out. Coupled with fantastic color choices and compositing, the OP gives off an extremely vibrant and bright energy that matches that of the characters well. \n\n\nHowever, this opening is a bit more on the conventional side, as it doesn't do much to stand out amongst the crowd or general ‘shounen' aesthetic. That being said, the direction, animation, and overall character dynamics make “Ao No Sumika” an OP worth highlighting as one of the standouts of this year.",

The direction is heavily geared towards atmospheric rim lights that are bathed in red and black to portray brutality and destructive battles, with lives at stake in every moment.\n\n\nThe structure of King Gnu's work here leads the OP, as the sway of the song shifts the tone between scenes of solemn moodiness and hostile action. Sadly, these shifts aren't as strongly pronounced in aggression as they could have been, leaving a feeling of missed potential. Further, given the heavy reliance on red and black to match its atmosphere, the OP underutilized negative space to amplify the vicious tone, with only a few sections near the beginning implementing it well. This lack of color variance creates a restrictive tension, where its eruption in the chorus fails to capitalize on the belligerence of the ensuing carnage due to a mismatch of the song's vocals and distorted instruments.  \n\n\nDespite these missteps that could have been potentially mitigated with a more aggressive song composition and greater color variety, “Specialz” remains interesting and noteworthy for its commitment to an aesthetic that attempts to create a sharp mood reflective of the show's subject matter.",

          "writeup": "Much like the show, “Idol” is an opening that demands your attention. YOASOBI's hit song took the world by storm, and for good reason. The song leaves a strong impression with a compelling amalgamation of various styles, made cohesive by the strong use of transitions and instrumentation that allow it to make tonal changes with ease. The vocals start with a stylized delivery of the rap section combined with percussion, allowing it to open with a fittingly ominous atmosphere. This then shifts to a polished and upbeat performance that is fun and engaging. Coupled with synced moments like Ai's lip-sync or the waving glow sticks, the song is easily the star of the show.\n\n\nUnfortunately, the level of conceptualization in the song is not often matched by that of the opening's visuals. Yuusuke Yamamoto brings some solid imagery to highlight Ai's legendary presence. Sections such as the parallel segment of Aqua searching for the glamor of Ai's performance on stage, or the visual of Ruby receiving her mother's star featuring strong effects animation especially stand out. However, the rest of the opening is noticeably lacking in this regard, whether it be the nonspecific shots of the setting or the generally uninspired approach to its character showcase. This means that much of the OP can feel rather dull overall.\n\n\nDespite some rough edges, “Idol” remains an inviting exploration of *Oshi no Ko*'s tones and ideas. These clear strengths allow it to more than hold its own underneath the spotlight—in a way not unlike the idols themselves.",

        "blurb": "The year 2023 provided the most competitive ED category in Awards history. Between the joyous energy of “Himegoto Cry Sisters”, the personality and warmth of “Todome no Ichigeki” and “Akari”, the heavy-hitting drama in “Mukyuu Platonic”, or the explosive flair of “Red:birthmark”, the top six made for a varied list that shows off the best the ED category can hope for. While it was a neck-and-neck race between the top nominees, ultimately it was the mellow yet majestic “Anytime, Anywhere” depicting Frieren’s passage of time and connection with nature that captured the jury’s hearts the most. EDs that felt a tad more inconsistent placed among the lower end of the jury’s top half.   While it’s hard to deny the gap between the nominations near the top and the ones near the bottom, every entry here has something strong about it to appreciate. “Nuisance” depicts the anxieties of its cast members in creative and visually striking ways. “know me…” manages to add a melancholic beat to every episode of the series by depicting Andy’s relationship with death and his past. “Mephisto”’s stellar song adds an explosive ending to every episode, while “More than Words” provides a moment of relief and intimacy that many action series fail to achieve in their ED.  The jury takes a lot of time and effort to discuss and compare a list of so many strong nominees, so please check out their motivation and thoughts on each of these EDs in the respective writeups.",

          "writeup": "In a world where conventional warfare has been replaced by inherently dangerous high-stakes spycraft, it follows that the spies themselves would be incredibly stressed out. Now in its second season, *Spy Classroom* uses “Nuisance” to explore how heavily their tasks weigh on them, especially so since the spies shown handle particularly deadly missions. As their work takes place out of the public eye, the ED is able to give viewers an intimate look into the psyche of these spies that's intentionally hidden from most of the rest of the characters in the show.\n\n\nWhat these glimpses show is unsettling, to say the least. Multiple types of psychoses and mental breakdowns are portrayed, accompanied by near-constant visual flickering that only heightens the sense of unease. The color design is also a major strength, allowing points of violent interest to stand out against muted and faded colors. Combine that with a dynamic vocal performance, and the sense of unease becomes inescapable. \n\n\nAs heavy-hitting as some of the moments in this ED are, there are some issues with the beginning and end. Fairly basic character, group, and everyday shots take away from rather than enhance the anxiety and pressure that define this ED. There are also times in the latter half when high-energy portions of the song are a mismatch for the fairly static visuals they play over.  Overall though, it manages to be one of the most effectively unsettling EDs of the year.",

          "writeup": "Attached to an obscure isekai series, “Mukyuu Platonic” is a diamond in the rough. While the plot of *One-Turn Kill Nee-san* only lightly touches on the experiences of those left behind after someone disappears, this ED does an outstanding job of expressing the grief and loneliness said experience might evoke, showing us parts of the story that the anime itself doesn't find the time to.\n\n\n“Mukyuu Platonic” stands out not just by its choice to tell its own narrative, but also in the way it depicts it. Windows and screens form boundaries between the protagonist and her brother. The colorful fantasy world contrasted against a gray reality provides a striking depiction of day-to-day grief. As this grief shifts into a dreadful emptiness, signified through a shift in her expression, she walks up onto the rooftop to seemingly end it all. An instrumental pause in the song provides the perfect backdrop for a moment of realization, as the screen pans away from her to reveal a gateway has finally opened up that allows her to enter the fantasy world and save her brother from ultimate despair. The storytelling of the ED is sublime and the bassy song elevates all the associated feelings brilliantly. \n\n\nUnfortunately, the ED has an odd anomaly that holds it back, as the dance sequence that it ends on feels very out of place against the bitter tone of the rest of the ED. While this final sequence somewhat undercuts it tonally, “Mukyuu Platonic” ultimately still conveys its narrative with both power and finesse.",

          "writeup": "Choosing to base an ending on a character's idealized imagining of their own death and how serene it could be is a fairly unconventional move, but for *Undead Unluck* it's a perfect fit. “Know me...” provides a compelling look at the immortal Andy's brooding, contemplative side, so often masked in the series by his brash, crude antics. It also provides the best insight so far in the anime into why Andy desires so strongly to finally die, and which emotions he associates with that desire.\n\n\nIts strongest suit is setting an appropriate atmosphere. A gently rolling piano combines with a contemplative, yet not particularly grieving, vocal performance from Kairi Yagi in order to create a sense of peace out of what would ordinarily be rather morbid subject matter. This is further amplified by the use of gentle grays and whites in the visuals, making his self-imagined death neither violent nor intimidating, but instead tranquil. The shot of Andy dressed in his suit inside the coffin filled with flowers as the boat glides upon the River Styx is particularly poignant, with strong cinematography joining the aforementioned elements to further enhance the emotional impact.\n\n\nUnfortunately, the ED is inconsistent with that impact. A quick runthrough of the post-apocalyptic world and a fairly basic walk cycle featuring Juiz drag down the mid-to-late section considerably, harming the connection between the most emotional bits early on and at the end. Despite these missteps, “know me...” still has considerable emotional punch that makes it worthy of praise.",

The animation excels in expressiveness, fluidity, and attention to detail, making the characters' emotions and actions feel incredibly lifelike. This pairs excellently with the vibrant color palettes and playful hand-drawn bubble letters to depict a wholesome hangout between the main characters over the course of a day.\n\n\nThe song is a triumph and manages to build throughout, culminating in a final chorus that uses ascending key changes to complement an incredible dance sequence. Despite the busyness of the ED, the synchronization between the song and visuals is commendable, creating a cohesive and engaging experience. The ED effectively captures the essence of the series, with themes of friendship and self-discovery reflected in the characters' interactions and expressions.\n\n\nThere are some minor drawbacks such as the use of character cards, which are acceptable but take up valuable time in the ED that could have been used to showcase more of its strengths. The manic composition also toed the line between energetic and dizzying. Nevertheless, the combination of outstanding animation, catchy music, and thematic resonance are well-deserving of praise and make \"Himegoto Cry Sisters\" stand out as one of the best EDs of the year.",

          "writeup": "*Spy × Family* has a habit of focusing around Anya's character a bit more than the rest of the cast. This carries over to a larger degree when it comes to “Todome no Ichigeki”, as the entire ending song takes place within her imagination. It is a well written testament to the inner workings of a carefree child's mind, with bouncy, floaty imagery all over complemented by the stellar vocal performance of Vaundy. \n\n\nWith a zoetrope at the start, a toy plane flying about a hanging earth in space, and the use of a cardboard-cutout aesthetic, the ED is filled with childish imagery. It's only made explicitly clear that this is all in Anya's mind at the end, as the final scene recontextualizes the ED into her drawing of the family, but little details here and there give plenty of indication that this is her world and what she thinks of it. Her friends floating around with the background imagery, as she makes her characteristic faces towards them give a good indicator of how she thinks of them.\n\n\n“Todome no Ichigeki” is a great example of an ending song that is smooth throughout, with a clear goal and no real hiccups along the way. However, it has the unfortunate flaw of having no real stand out moments, just simply a consistently high level of quality throughout. That being said, it is a pleasant watch worth highlighting as among the best of the year, and seeing the warmth of Anya's world through her eyes is something special.",

          "writeup": "With a dreamlike presentation and an uplifting yet melancholic vibe, “Akari” pulls off a fantastic balancing act to convey its themes of friendship and depression. From the very start of the ED, Soushi Sakayama's superb vocal performance lulls the viewer into its world. The backgrounds are breathtaking, with a watercolor aesthetic used that causes them to look realistic and lived in. This is further highlighted through excellent direction and efficient scene transitions that are expertly synchronized between beat breaks. \n\n\n*Jujutsu Kaisen*'s characters also are quite expressive and emotive here, with their animation, facial expressions, and body movements being quite clean and crisp. It also has nice vocal breaks between the alternating Gojo and Geto scenes. The ED also has a good amount of narrative significance which gives it a lot of life and atmosphere, as each of the two fish represent Gojo and Geto, light and dark. The rain symbolizes the depression that builds deep within Geto as the first arc of season two progresses. \n\n\nSadly, the ED is held back by some of the moments that could be considered a bit mundane or boring. Despite this, “Akari” stands out with its tonal mix of overwhelmingly warm sincerity and looming sadness. Combine that with some standout character moments, color choices, and emotion, and it creates an experience that makes it worthy of standing alongside the best EDs of the year.",

From AiNA THE END's nontraditional vocal inflection and range, to the visuals being bathed in deep and dark colors, the ED has a unique flair throughout. The linework is also great, with the white lines coming in and out as well as spawning people or mechs, giving something for the MC to interact with. \n\n\nThe transition to more powerful instrumentation and vocals towards the middle of the ED is amazing, with the scene shifting to the gundam looking like it is ripping her heart out before she goes on to start dancing in a beautiful black dress. The synchronization of the visuals and music here is also fantastic, with each high and low note being integrated via black paint strokes. The instruments are so powerful with the drums, bass, and guitars all hitting a high note before a very brief reprieve near the climax towards the middle. Afterwards, it hits a much lower note and the visuals continue to synchronize well.\n\n\nThe biggest drawback in the ED is that the last thirty seconds are lacking in terms of visuals, as the two girls just spin around a bit too long. The credit integration is also not very good and obscures some of the visuals at times. That being said, “Red:Birthmark” has a very unique presentation with an interesting color scheme, cool visual artifacts, and a fantastic vocal performance that all work to make it a wonderful ending theme.",

With only the main trio being highlighted and simply taking pictures of each other and their scenery, the ED has a nice sense of focus. Showing daily life is a good way to get to know characters more, and bring out the feeling of what these characters' lives might be like. The issue with how “More Than Words” goes about it is how fast the pictures go by, and how little of the characters is actually shown, somewhat dampening the point of the theme in the first place.\n\n\nThere do not seem to be underlying themes or meanings to this ending sequence, the point is more just to show photography and the trio out around town taking pictures. This does create a softer feeling, and Hitsuji Bungaku does a good job of matching that energy with their song. “More Than Words” carries the tone of this theme throughout along the shots of scenery and video of a life lived in the moment. The overall feel of the theme may have benefitted from a slightly slower pace, or fewer shots in order to properly take in what was being shown.\n\n\nAll in all though, the ED does a good job of helping to calm down from the action of the season, and seeing the trio enjoy time together is memorable enough– making “More Than Words” more than deserving of a place on this list.",

The song does an outstanding job of supporting this aesthetic by creating an atmosphere that is equal parts uplifting and soft, further conveying not only the beauty of life and nature, but also the melancholy in how fleeting it can be.\n\n\nDespite the ED's relatively crude credit placement that can disrupt the impact of some imagery at times, its atmosphere and theme are conveyed powerfully.

Despite a few visually interesting moments, like the ominous red string of fate, the ending fails to deliver a compelling story or evoke genuine emotion.\n\n\nThe song by Queen Bee is the standout feature of the ED. It has a catchy beat and is easy to listen to. The violin intro in the first episode adds a needed moment of decompression that isn't present in the shortened version of the song largely used from episode two onwards. However, its integration with the theme falls short, contributing to the disjointed feel of the ending sequence.

These are shows that elicited laughter, evoked tears, and resonated deeply with our lives. Yet amidst the celebrations of achievements, there lies a more profound meaning to the “Anime of the Year” category and the awards in general - one about community.   As a subreddit boasting over nine million users at the time of writing, it's important to acknowledge the significance of our collective existence. Through the expanse of the internet, we forge bonds that stretch the globe, creating a global community bound by a shared passion. You can be an avid aficionado or a casual fan, seeking profound meaning or just watching for pleasure, but anime offers a common ground where diverse voices can sing from beyond its small original borders. It's a media that increasingly represents globalization and artistic expression in a digital age, and we, as a group, have a front row seat.   So while personal preferences may differ, and the outcomes of the jury may surprise, the essence of the awards still lies in its ability to give a brief moment of unity - one where we take pause in our daily lives and unite not as strangers nor as foes, but as a community to debate, salute, and commemorate the shows that have enriched our lives in the past year.

Along with all of their development and character depth rooted from their experiences, the idols still excel as idols with their fun, rich personalities. \n\n\nShowcasing a wide variety of fans and the different methods of coping with idol drama, *IDOLiSH7 Third Beat! Part 2* provides an excellent exploration of the idol industry. It also goes into themes of corporate power versus the will of fans and idols, and provides a solid framework towards the ideas of the power of unionizing and working together. Despite the visual presentation not being as outstanding as other shows this year, *Idolish7* is still a remarkable show that provided a complete package, with interesting, well-rounded characters and relevant themes being elements of its strength.\n",

          "writeup": "*Uma Musume: Pretty Derby - ROAD TO THE TOP* tells the story of Narita Top Road, Admire Vega, and T.M. Opera O as they compete to reach the top of the horse racing world. With four episodes that were quick, sharp, and to the point, the show excelled due to its succinct character writing and dynamic production.\n\n\nNarita Top Road is a standout character of the year with her endearing personality and struggles achieving success making her easy to sympathize with. Narita's confidence issues are explored through her fear of not wanting to let down the people supporting her. Further, both her and Vega's arc tie into the show's main themes of unhealthy expectations and how they can drag you down mentally.\n\n\n*Road to the Top* is enhanced by its production through a strong usage of lighting and insightful cinematography into the different emotions of characters as their arcs progressed. The character designs are also a highlight, with distinct designs each giving a glimpse into the personalities of the cast. There are plenty of strong sequences of animation as well, especially during the races. \n\n\nAdversely, the messy portrayal of survivor's guilt in Vega's arc held the show back, with Vega's chemistry with the rest of the cast also feeling awkward and stunted. Nonetheless, from its breathtaking visuals to its strong story beats and its relatable themes, *Road to the Top* is a superb, well-executed show that stands out as one of the best of the year.\n",

          "writeup": "Improving upon the immensely popular foundation set by the first season, *SPYxFAMILY Season 2* continues to create more charming and wholesome family moments. The Cruise arc is a major highlight of the season, providing a deeper look at Yor while also blending action and comedy impeccably.\nThis season gives meaningful character development to Yor who badly needed some time in the spotlight, giving her a development that mirrors Loid's motivations of protecting their loved ones. Her reconciling with her job and newfound family, coupled with a change of scenery, helped to keep the series fresh and exciting. \n\n\nAnya's childish schemes continue to mix well with Loid's denseness, and her animated reactions lend to plenty laugh-out-loud moments that complement the arc's action scenes. Her solo skits were also hysterical, with her strength as a comedic character being another strong point of the season. Unfortunately, later skits with side characters were less favorable, and it would have made for a stronger finale to conclude the season with the Cruise arc. And while the cinematography is consistently good, it doesn't do anything particularly unique to truly stand out. \n\n\nAll in all though, *SPYxFAMILY Season 2* excels for its strong character development, comedy backed by great character expressivity, and the successful integration of a more serious action-packed story arc with dazzling sequences that captivates the audience.",

          "writeup": "At first glance, taking five quirky teenage girls with the same hobby but starkly different personalities and sticking them together is an age-old recipe for a light-hearted and comforting  \"cute girls doing cute things\" show. But what happens when you dial up those quirky personalities into fully-fledged realistic character flaws and start the show in media res following a traumatic break up of the group? Enter *Bang Dream! It's MyGO!!!!!*, a deceptively simple teenage band drama with more toxic character flaws than titular exclamation marks.\n\n\n*MyGO* tells the tale of the dissolution and revival of the band Crychic, a band composed of girls who are fun, comedic, and charismatic… but also selfish, spiteful, and manipulative. The show commits to a \"show, don't tell\" approach for this dysfunctional aspect of the characters—expressing the duality of their personalities and beliefs through physical behavior and emphasized by cinematography. Despite this heavy emphasis on the negative traits of the central characters' personalities, the series ultimately brings home the storyline in a compelling manner that acknowledges the characters' incompatibility in a mature way, rather than a saccharine forced harmony.\n\n\n*MyGO* is a roller coaster of drama. It carefully balances the dysfunction of its characters against their cooperation towards a shared goal and repeatedly delivers thrilling twists that thwart their progress. Like any good roller coaster, it knows how to build up to a few *especially* momentous and delightful moments that form some of the most satisfying narrative climaxes of the year.\n",

The cast's wide array of outfits go a long way in contributing to the themes of expression, and help to give insight into how they feel most comfortable. The developing wardrobe in particular adds new dimensions to Mahiro as more feminine clothing, hair, and make-up make them happier and they become more outgoing. The exaggerated and emotive character animation alongside standout voice acting enhance both the wholesome slice-of-life moments and the comedic scenes, each in their own way. \n\n\n*Onimai* does open itself up to controversy in its premise and how this plays alongside the ecchi comedy. Mahiro is not a willing participant in Mihari's experiment at first. They do come to enjoy their new life so we can quickly move past that, but there is a more persistent issue in Mahiro's age regression, made even more troublesome by the ecchi comedy.\n\n\nNonetheless, *Onimai* displays heart in much of what it does. It shows siblings helping one another express themselves and how friendship can help comfort people in being who they are. It displays possibly the most care and skill in animation of any series this year, amongst other achievements. *Onimai* stands out as one of the best series this year had to offer.",

Newly introduced nymphomaniac Elinalise could have been an interesting counterpoint to the Mushoku Tensei world's sexual dichotomy, but instead she is simply made to be \"suffering\" from a magical curse of forced promiscuity.\n\n\nWhen putting aside these thoughts and issues, the series can transform into an exciting fantasy adventure playing by its own rules. However, season two's narrative beats make it increasingly difficult to view the series from this more optimistic perspective. Rudeus does not just purchase a child slave, he heartily compares her despair at being chained and caged her whole infancy to his own depression as an adult shut-in in the real world. The series even introduces Nanahoshi, another reincarnated character from our world who specifically points out how deplorable the world is and eagerly wishes to return home. \n\n\n*Mushoku Tensei Season 2* does still bring exciting battles and many laughs, but this awkward season suffers greatly from its indecision over exploring its overall direction: not quite committing to being a fun fantasy romp nor delving properly into the heavy topics it raises\n",

          "writeup": "*Tengoku Daimakyou* opens across two contrasting narratives: one within the confines of an utopian children's facility, the other tracing a duo's odyssey across a post-apocalyptic Japan. Yet, both storylines undergo an artful subversive evolution, challenging their initial portrayals. Scenes increasingly juxtapose the facility's claustrophobic and austere interiors with the wide-open and warmly paletted landscapes of the road trip, deftly crafting a sense of curiosity and tension within the viewer.\n\n\nAt the core of this narrative prowess lies outstanding production quality. Each scene is bathed in evocative lighting, action is impressively shot with high angles or dynamic camera movements, and the background art is consistently gorgeous. The storyboarding is also superb, unveiling the mysterious world at a tantalizing pace. Every moment feels purposeful, whether it's comedic relief maintaining narrative significance or conversational topics becoming ensuing establishing shots.\n\n\nWhile the narrative is unwavering, the characters occasionally falter. The children in the facility are purposefully alien, but blend together in an expanded cast. Similarly, while the duo's personalities are charming, they verge on unoriginal. \n\n\nHowever, the show's most contentious aspect emerges in the finale. Exceptional production thrusts forward themes of self-identity through a merciless scene that is difficult to watch. The scene, coupled with the absence of a clear resolution, cast a  pessimistic shadow across both plotlines, understandably leaving some viewers dissatisfied. But it's a deliberate artistic choice. By maintaining an steadfast commitment to its narrative tone and refusing to provide an easy release from the tension it builds, *Tengoku Daimakyou* emerges as a distinct beacon within anime, challenging its audience with complex and audacious storytelling.\n",

          "writeup": "The thrilling second season of the hit shonen *Jujutsu Kaisen* brings with it both a cathartic narrative and intriguing character beats, as well as strong, if inconsistent, visual production.\n\n\nThe Hidden Inventory arc provides a heartfelt primer and strong character backstory for both Geto and Gojo. The story it tells lays the groundwork for the stakes that follow in the Shibuya Incident arc, in which we watch our heroes battle through a mostly exciting  gauntlet of strong Curses and Curse Users. The fights themselves were a bit more of a mixed bag, however. Clever use of striking colors, dramatic lighting, and cinematography during the Choso fight all do a great job at drawing the audience into the action while giving the viewer a real sense of the stakes and consequences. However, some of the fights against Mahito are hurt somewhat by inconsistent background art, and Itadori's clash with the Locust early on loses a lot of its impact in a blurry flurry of punches that feels visually a step down from many of the later duels. The fight scenes also lean a bit too heavily on “power explanation” at times, and the sheer number of battles drags down the show's pacing.\n\n\nStill, there are plenty of opportunities here for fan favorite characters to shine, and the Shibuya Incident truly feels like it brings with it major stakes and consequences. For fans of the franchise, *Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2* brings action in spades with enough narrative heft and slick animation to make it a worthy nominee for Anime of the Year.",

          "writeup": "While the thrilling premier of *[Oshi no Ko]* frames a dark mystery, the show's true strength lies in its portrayal of Aqua and Ruby, twin children of legendary idol Ai, navigating Japan's entertainment industry. Through them, the show crafts a resonant exploration of the therapeutic power that relationships can have. \n\n\nYet, despite Aqua's role as one of the protagonists, his character often undermines the impact of the show. His motivations clumsily progress the peripheral mystery forward, while his habitual brooding and monotone demeanor exacerbates the frequent superficial industry criticism and reliance on expository dialogue.\n\n\nDuring these recurring monologue sequences, the animation remains generally still, relying on subtle body movements and solid character design to avoid tedium. However, outside of these static storyboarding moments, the production captivates. The finale delivers the gold standard of idol concerts, comedic sequences are uniquely detailed, and the cinematography consistently illustrates emotions and power dynamics through its lighting and recurring close-ups.\n\n\nThese latter cinematic techniques are most striking during Episode 6, which spirals to a harrowing climax. Alone, this episode is among this year's most memorable, innovatively adapting a real-life example of the damaging impacts of modern online culture. However, its broader significance is in laying the foundations for the show's contemporary themes that surpass the arc's brisk resolution towards mental health.\n\n\nThrough this episode, characters become representations of obsession and loneliness bred by collectivism, unveiling the show's positive message advocating for genuine relationships and open dialogue. It's a modern perspective that is unafraid to confront societal issues. It's emotional, authentic, novel, and it involves every major character to reinforce *[Oshi no Ko]*'s deliberate setting within an industry where connections reign supreme.",

His development from a character full of hatred to one embodying absolute pacifism is interesting given his situation, and makes great contrast with Canute who is now a warmonger after being fearful of Thorfinn and violence in the past.\nHowever, the first half of the Farmland arc is slow and occasionally dull. The production presents decent backgrounds but lacks variety and character animation to be more captivating. \n\n\nWhile Thorfinn's development into the pacifist he ends up becoming is fascinating, it isn't necessary for his enlightenment to take this long to reach. Thorfinn's pacifist stance is also taken to an impractical extreme that could understably break the viewer's suspension of disbelief.\n\n\nSlavery is a central theme of the season. The examination of power structures and dehumanization is strong and touched upon with nuance, taking into account its historical context. But there is a dissonance near the end of the anime when Thorfinn fights to defend the farm, which seems inconsistent with the exploration of slavery due to his need to ‘pay back' a place that fomented such societal ill.\n*Vinland Saga Season 2* is a well regarded series that overall succeeds in exploring complex themes and personal growth in a rather unique setting for anime.",

Euphonium* returns to the events immediately following of *Chikai Finale* with the theatrical OVA *Tokubetsu-hen Hibike! Euphonium: Ensemble Contest*. The series re-centers on Kumiko now holding a leadership position in the music club. Despite the short runtime the movie manages to tackle two major anxieties Kumiko has for the future, her effectiveness as a leader to incoming students and her ability to maintain and improve upon her euphonium playing skills. The film returns to focusing on the push and pull dynamic between Kumiko and her platonic girl friend Reina, reminiscent of the first season. It also manages to highlight Kumiko's long standing skill as an attentive observer, and how she uses this to gently inspire ensemble members to improve their playing abilities.\n\n\nVisually, the staff from Kyoto Animation go above and beyond in emoting characters in unique ways, from Kanade's mischievous side steps, to the confident way Reina's hair swings back and forth.

          "writeup": "Tomohisa Taguchi rightfully earns a spot within this years best anime movies, with his project *Natsu e no Tunnel, Sayonara no Deguchi* after just barely missing the cut in 2020 with *Digimon Adventure: LAST EVOLUTION Kizuna*.\n\n\n*Natsu e no Tunnel* is a romance drama with time travel elements and brisk pacing that feels perfect for the summertime setting. The chemistry between the two leads, Kaoru and Anzu, is the core of the film. The pair bond over their shared family traumas during their first encounter, and the symbolic sharing of Kaoru's umbrella immediately solidifies them as a believable and compelling couple. Both of these characters also have well established backstories that add to their motivations as to why they would want to explore the time bending tunnel together. \n\n\nVisually, Taguchi utilizes his signature rim lighting to the highest degree, however it is the motifs and exceptional storyboarding that distinguished themselves within the film's stellar production. It's therefore disappointing to see shortcomings, like the film's titular Tunnel being plagued by distracting compositing of quite uninspired CG elements. Meanwhile, the sound design has fantastic usage of clicks and snaps from the flip phones the characters use, but the voice acting is lacking, with some of the actors giving rather monotone delivery during visually plain scenes. \n\n\nOverall, with so many franchise films releasing nowadays, *Natsu e no Tunnel* is a solid choice for those wanting a quick, engaging standalone movie experience. It delivers a compelling love story and shines brightly as another Taguchi project.",

          "writeup": "Many anime fans may recall growing up watching shows like *Power Rangers* or movies like *Godzilla*, and battling the strongest heroes and monsters of the toybox against each other. It is this sense of childlike nostalgia that is the heart of *Gridman Universe*. \n\n\nThe franchise's first feature film builds off the work of prequels, exploring themes of storytelling and escapism, as well as providing a loving homage to the tokusatsu genre. Watching worlds meld and the casts of *SSSS.Gridman* and *SSSS.Dynazenon* meet for the very first time provides the film with ample material. Untangling how *Universe* intermingles the diegetic play, the story of *Gridman*, and the film itself is a fun metatextual dive, further complemented by the film's integration of live action sequences. Furthermore, *Universe*'s fights are captivatingly animated, with slick transformation sequences and impact frames, while the lighting and cinematography are consistent strengths out of combat too.\n\n\n*Universe* isn't perfect, however. As fun as it is to watch the cast bounce off each other, the *Dynazenon* characters aren't as well integrated as they could have been. Gauma's major character moment is underwhelming and Chise and Koyomi both stand out as underutilized. The film at times feels less like a multiverse mashup and more like a Gridman sequel played straight in more ways than one. The core romance is also underdeveloped, and the tokusatsu fanservice may fall flat for those who didn't grow up watching the genre. Still, *Gridman Universe* delivers hype action and fights in spades, earning its spot among the best anime films of 2023.\n",

Most details are left vague to tease the upcoming series, without the audience getting much chance to understand why specific events are happening. Many characters are introduced but little is revealed about anyone. Instead of spending time on the main players of the holy grail war, the movie meanders around characters that have very little plot relevancy. There is potential here for an interesting narrative in the future but little to chew on for now.\n\n\nIn terms of production the movie is a mixed bag. It is far too dark, some scenes are barely visible due to the poor contrast. The directing also suffers from shoddy camerawork and shot composition throughout the movie. Characters are poorly composited with the backgrounds, unnaturally sticking out like a sore thumb.\n\n\nOne notable aspect of the movie is the animation quality of the fight sequences, particularly that of the main fight scene of the movie. This elevates an already intriguing fight between two of the series most storied characters to a properly grandiose scale, making for a remarkably exciting part of the movie. \n\n\nIt is ultimately thanks to these animation flourishes and the tantalizing promise, though currently unfulfilled, of a fresh *Fate* series that *Fate/strange Fake* finds itself among 2023's best anime movies.",

It's a fresh and creative new vision, built on the backbone of catchy tunes and a consistently excellent vocal performance by Ado. However, much of this excitement dissipates in the second half of the film, when insert songs revert back into the plain pirate fight animation characteristic of the TV series.\n\n\nA similar issue exists with the new central character Uta. She kickstarts the film with a captivating energy and charisma, and presents a fascinating moral counterpoint to the franchise's pirate and navy factions as she turns from ally to antagonist. Her scheme establishes interesting themes of safety-through-escapism and consenting to be saved, but those are abandoned when the final act sidelines Uta in favor of a different, ineffectively bland antagonist - Tot Musica. It acts as nothing more than a giant punching bag for all the characters to take turns making their token attack against, leaving the interesting themes and moral dilemmas of Uta largely unexplored.\n\n\nThe final battle does nevertheless exhibit some thrilling action via great impact frames and effects animation, as well as fan-favorite character pairings.

Rather than simply retreading the ground established in the series, the movie advances the main relationship by giving the two leads a better understanding of themselves and each other. It addresses how their mind games of trying to trick each other into confessing while withholding their own feelings have warped their relationship, finally allowing them to put these games aside in favor of an honest connection with one another.\n\n\nThe comedic tone predominates in the first half of the movie, as Kaguya's internal conflicts manifest in various exaggerated personalities, often resulting in comedic situations among the other characters. However, not all jokes land well, and the portrayal of Kaguya's literal personality split may come across as somewhat contrived. Still, many comedic situations not only succeed at being funny but also contribute to the characters' insecurities by highlighting their poor communication. This transition sets the stage for the more serious drama of the second half, and builds up the movie's resolution.\n\n\nAs the movie builds into its more dramatic segment, the depictions of Kaguya's internal turmoil grow more abstract, presenting the struggle she faces with who she is and who she pretends to be, and her desire to be accepted. This paired with Shirogane's own worries pace the movie well for its finale. With its compelling resolution, the Kaguya-sama movie merits a spot among the best of 2023.",

The animation and storyboarding are also superb, featuring expressive and detailed character motions that only falter when certain 3DCG elements are not smoothly composited with the hand-drawn art style.\n\n\nThe road trip narrative has titular Suzume meet a host of secondary characters who each imbue  fresh and engaging chemistry to the film with snappy banter and good jokes, but the dynamic between the main duo is not so strong. Their interactions feel wooden and are insufficient to justify the sudden romantic angle the finale takes.\n\n\nSuzume herself is also developed a bit awkwardly - the film rushes past her initial introduction, throwing her straight into adventure and not exploring her personality or circumstances until much later. Once the film develops her, however, the grief hiding behind her cheerful facade becomes both compelling character development and a poignant analogy for the necessary forward-thinking of a rebuilding society.\n\n\nIn a year choked with franchise films and epilogues, *Suzume* shines as a beautiful and joyful film, but also a suspenseful and contemplative experience.",

Some short films were brilliant displays of masterful animation, others provided deep and meaningful commentaries, and a few explored novel cinematography—every element of the creative process is experimented with and refined in this year’s shorts.  Stop-motion animations were out in force this year, with *Hidari*, *Blink in the Desert*, *Destiny*, and *Turtle's Stroll* all receiving acclaim.   It was also an interesting year for avant-garde art styles—most notably Honami Yano's painstakingly crafted pointillist aesthetic in *A Bite of Bone*, Ryotaro Miyajima's stunning ink wash animation in *Monk Seishin*, and Mirai Mizue's abstract exploration of compounded boarding in *Eternity*.   Amongst the more traditional festival and student films, *Himitsu no Hana no Niwa*, *Andersen*, *Hottest Tokyo*, and *Our Little Pond* were some of the many deep, moving works that nevertheless didn't quite make it into the final nominations.   There were also many strong showings from amidst the hundreds of eligible AMVs, from *Billimillion's* heartwarming message to *Kurae Telepathy's* infectious disco dancing to *Hanaarashi's* imaginative worldbuilding to *CASE 143's* bizarrely well-wrought tomfoolery.  This is just a small sample of the over 250 short films reviewed in the category this year, exemplifying the power and creativity that can be expressed in small runtimes. ",

This motif has been aptly critiqued by many, but never quite as poignantly or viscerally as in *Sewing Love*. Warm, soft colors and bright lighting of the initial visuals create a sickeningly radiant atmosphere, lulling the viewer into a false sense of security while maintaining a decidedly creepy undercurrent. The usage of a literal hole in the main character's body to symbolize their sense of loneliness and the subsequent melting together of the characters is a brilliant visual metaphor for longing and love.\n\n\nAt the turning point of the story the red thread motif assumes a central role. In the process, colors abruptly darken, linework becomes jagged, lighting turns harsh, and sound more discordant – cementing the creepy undercurrent already established.\n\n\nAll these elements work together to present some fantastic themes: a critique on the red thread motif typically rationalizing toxic behavior in romance; a commentary on lonely men going to extreme ends to find that perfect partner; and a condemnation of forcing lovers to fit you perfectly while paradoxically chasing an idealized version of them as symbolized by the butterfly.\n\n\n*Sewing Love* has it all, from beautiful usage of colors, light, and linework to create a strong sense of atmosphere to the fantastic animation and camerawork. Finally, the sound design conveying character emotions in lieu of voice acting while greatly contributing to the overall tone makes *Sewing Love* a horrifyingly brilliant short.",

The one that *House of Loss* asks is: “what happens when a society as a whole has moved on from a particular war, but the people who lived through it don't have that luxury?” By focusing on elderly care patients in South Korea who experienced the Korean War firsthand, this short is able to provide a glimpse into how some overlooked survivors of war can be failed by their countries.\n\n\nNearly every facet of the short feels carefully planned for maximum emotional impact. The muted color palette consistently helps to convey how dreary and oppressive the environment of the care facility is, while the character designs evoke a type of body horror that emphasizes that their lingering trauma from the war isn't something the patients can just move on from - they're stuck with it. The tender, soft-spoken narration serves a dual purpose by not only conveying that this topic is something not spoken of in the country where it's an issue, but also by signaling the feelings of the Janitor towards the suffering patients.\n\n\nThe concept and planning are joined by stellar execution. The sound effects in particular bring an immense amount of troubling realism to the short that prevents viewers from trying to distance themselves from the deeply uncomfortable subject matter. From start to finish, *House of Loss* is one of the most poignant shorts of the year.",

Perhaps the most unique aspect of this MV is the music itself – an eclectic mix riding the line between cacophony and melody, leitmotifs and recurrent chords create a bizarre, unsettling harmony. Seamlessly combining complementary aspects of glitchcore and more traditional electronica juxtaposed against analog choral chanting creates a sense of progression culminating in a brilliant crescendo…before it loops back to the beginning. \n\n \nBut this is an MV – and the visual component of the audiovisual feast is crucial. Aside from being in absolute lockstep with the intensity of the music, even to the reset mid-song, the visuals carefully and intentionally foster a surreal sense of chaos. *raputa* overloads the viewer with a truckload of imagery. And yet, visual motifs create footholds for the audience to begin to understand, and careful editing - combining a variety of different techniques to create an undeniably conspiratorial tone - invites a clear framework for analysis. Further, the consistent palette and overall aesthetic create a cohesive experience in spite of the sheer volume of imagery.\n \n\nThe visuals themselves are also impressive – the mixed media and found footage carve out a unique aesthetic, and the aforementioned palette of blood reds, deep blacks, and gorgeous blues creates a gorgeous colorscape.

The direction here is top notch with the obvious highlights being the lighting and camera work. The cinematography is also fantastic with grandiose choreography and style, *Hidari* offers an expressive and entertaining experience on all levels. \n\n\nThe characters are all wooden pieces and they are clearly hand-carved; twine and fabrics made specifically for the film, swords and a chainsaw weapon, are all in service of this style. Any time someone gets cut up, they burst into wood-chips. The action choreography here is astoundingly good as well, with quick character movements that are fluid and precise. The special effects especially heighten the impact of everything going on. Clicks and clacks of the wood characters running around and metal on metal sword slinging makes the reverberations sound exceptional and awfully realistic which is a testament to the outstanding sound design. The backing soundtrack has some traditional string instrumentation which not only fits the samurai aesthetic, but also changes into a lot more modern style when the supporting percussion line kicks in.\n\n\nAlthough *Hidari* has few things to criticize as it bursts with style and unique character, it can be seen as lacking in narrative direction.

Watching the various little critters move throughout their fascinating little world is consistently delightful. The way the cat sparks into an inferno as it goes down to slide or bounds up the stairs with their furry green friend both stand out as especially strong cuts. The storyboarding and framing of shots is also very well done, with the short's unique and distinctive setting brought to life for the viewer.\n\n\n*Night Owl* is touching as well. It does an excellent job pulling at the heartstrings; the story it weaves of alienation and belonging will resonate for many a viewer. Although it is a bit hard to follow in its third act, the both literal and figurative warmth with which it concludes is cathartic.

The music has strong and weak elements – the recorder is messy and nasally, but in a charming way that fits the grade schooler in the music video, and the clear tempo and straightforward instrumentation creates a groove that is an instant earworm. However, the Vocaloid singing is a weak point, and while the simplicity furthers its goals of being memetic, the limited variety also makes it somewhat less interesting than other entries.\n\n\nLikewise, the visuals offer some impressive peaks – with the chopping melon cut and the afterimage effect being especially praiseworthy – while also being generally well-synchronized with the music, not only in timing but also in showcasing the actual instrumentation on-screen.  The bold colors help in carving out a strong visual identity. At its best, the MV effused this wonderful sense of whimsy that well complements the quirky song in more ways than one.\n\n\nHowever, aside from these elements, the visuals are somewhat lacking. Lazily integrated and reused animations, such as the walking sequence, give a repetitive feel to the MV, counteracting its characteristic whimsy.\n\n\nPerhaps even more strikingly, this MV was simply that – a highly experiential MV that played alongside a song. Though lacking the ambition, goals, or thematic depth found in the other entries, its immense memetic success proves it achieves its modest goals. While *Kyoufu All Back* possesses a fair amount of charm, certain elements often undermine it.",

          "writeup": "A glorious case of the rare AMV that both commits to an interesting idea and doesn't skimp on details, *Shinkiro* is a loving callback to the 1980's city pop genre and the popular online trend of pairing those songs with vintage anime clips. In it, Marine and Gura sing a wistful song of summer romance that feels straight out of a Junko Yagami album over animation that lovingly imitates the visual aesthetics of a bygone era of anime.\n\n\nIt is the sheer commitment to detail in this AMV that elevates it beyond the norm—the creators clearly did their homework, and it truly shows. The retro anime aesthetic is not just recreated in the 4:3 aspect ratio and palette choice, but in many minute details; the linework of a briefly glimpsed headlight, the timing of the comedic character design shifts, and the diagonal multi-plane establishing shot of city landscapes, to list some examples. It must also be noted that this is one of the most consistently well animated AMVs in the category this year, with detailed character designs constantly in motion and no reliance on repeating segments or other shortcuts.\n\n\nWhile its simpler story lags behind other entries with more themes to explore and more to say, *Shinkiro*'s complete understanding of the era it homages and its steadfast commitment to painstaking detail in recreating that era remains a tremendous accomplishment.",

          "writeup": "As a celebration of *Fate/Grand Order*, the Memorial Movie brings some of the most memorable servants to life with stunning animation and photography. After initially flaunting the servants at the height of their power, seeing a world where memory of them has mostly faded reminds us of their humanity. Then juxtaposing images of modern conflicts reinforce the endurance of humankind across the eras. While strong vocals guide the short, one of the most impactful moments is when the music cuts out while Artoria accepts a summon, after which the music and servants return in joyous celebration. These ideas are visually supported by strong character animation, effects animation, and a flexible art style which effortlessly jumps through time and setting. Framing the entire short through the eyes of Mash also adds clever context to the storytelling, ultimately linking Mash together with the heroes of old. \n\n\nLike many of the best shorts this year there are just mostly minor weaknesses, which only stand out against tough competition. Occasional dips in animation, in what is primarily an animation showcase, are noticeable. Structurally tying it so closely to a core set of characters and cycling through similar shots for each leads repetitive feeling sequences. Similarly, the thematic beats work great as a strong linking narrative, but lack the ambition and execution of other stronger entries. Those few things aside, the *Fate/Grand Order Memorial Movie* stands as an excellent work for fans of the series with technical strength and approachable narrative hooks that allow anyone to appreciate this work.",

          "writeup": "The music video for *Loli Kami Requiem* combines energetic vocals with provocative lyrics and electronic instrumentation to create a real earworm. Musically, the short has a hard emphasis on bassy sounds on the beat along with electronic and synthetic instrumentation similar to the dubstep genre. Ui's vocals in the chorus have an upbeat pacing that makes the song particularly catchy.\n\n\nThe dance sequence is also pretty spectacular, with high quality animation through a combination of expressive movements, and high-contrast dynamic, colorful backgrounds that still allow for the foreground dance number to come across clearly. And while the multiple dance sequences during the chorus are each distinct and non-repeated sequences, these account for only around 30 seconds of the over 4 minutes of runtime. Unfortunately the majority of the visuals of the short are dominated by panning shots of a single pose, with only slight variation of facial expressions. This repetition aptly follows the catchiness of the music, but fails to participate in the hype that it builds.\n\n\n*Loli Kami Requiem* has appeal in its catchy music and eye-catching dance sequences, but when compared to the strong, visually expressive, aesthetically cohesive and theatrically pleasing experiences offered by other nominees, it is an enjoyable AMV but disappointing short film.",

          "writeup": "*Idol* features interesting visual imagery and exploration on the themes of the lies idols tell to impress, as it juxtaposes Ai's inner thoughts with her outward idol persona.\n\n\nDespite its short length and connection to *[Oshi no Ko]* giving insight on what is presented, *Idol* makes welcome space for alternative interpretations. This is due to its interesting use of visual imagery and symbolism, like the rabbit made to represent the facade she puts on for work. Its imagery showcases the act that Ai puts on while also commenting on the idol industry in general without using any dialogue. Yoasobi's lyrics also work to reinforce this idea, as the song encompasses the lies she's telling to herself and others as an idol, while also highlighting that the one thing she didn't lie about was loving her kids.\n\n\nThe short burdens itself in ties to *[Oshi no Ko]*, with Aqua and Ruby's inclusion feeling needlessly shoved into a couple parts, distracting from the main narrative with Ai. A larger problem however is that this is mostly lacking a lot of the creative animation that some of the nominees have. The short is rather stiff and relies on the presentation and intrigue behind its artwork. Despite these flaws, the short has impressive storyboarding and its imagery is striking enough that it does not weigh down on the short substantially.\n\n\n*Idol* has some strong elements such as its compelling themes about the facade the idol industry forces on the people within, while exploring beneath Ai's facade through a strong use of symbolic imagery and lyrics.",
