While many of those were highly anticipated sequels like Attack on Titan, My Hero Academia, Fate and FLCL; there were also a good number of originals (of various degrees) to help spyce up the year. In fact, only two of the final nominations ended up being hard sequels, which just speaks to the amount of variety and creativity in the genre in 2018. After narrowing down the huge number action shows to just 7, the following nominations are the best of the bunch. Fights this year feature superheroes, VR, boxing, 90’s throwback mechs, mechs in space, and Captain Levi. The jury spent a lot of time deliberating, comparing the highs and lows, discussing action and story alike. In a year where the highs and lows were each so large, consistency became an important deciding factor. Our final ranking reflects this, but again, these top 7 are only a small sample of the fairly strong offering 2018 gave us.",

The episodic structure at the start of the show eases the viewers into the setting, while introducing a big and varied cast, where all characters get their backstory, personality, goals and weaknesses establish, in a mere 12 episodes. It throws a couple of curveballs to the viewer, but none of these feel out of place, with what the show have already established.\n\nProduction wise Planet With is the weakest entry in this category, almost unanimously agreed upon by the jurors. The OST and sound design is stellar, but its character designs and cinematography is decent at best, falling short of its competitors. While the CG made certain fight scenes more fluid, the jury agreed that it was a clear negative in the end.\n\nPlanet With would have been a strong 1st place contender for it's good pacing and focused narrative, was it not for the few final episodes. The last stretch felt rushed, and the final fight was anticlimactic to say the least. While the ending made sense with the rules and themes established, it was a little too predictable compared to the rest of the show, leaving the jury unsatisfied. Despite these minor issues, Planet With earns the 3rd place ranking, in a tough fight between MHA S3 and SSSS.Gridman for 2nd place, through its focused narrative and strong characters.",

        "writeup": "A surprise hit of the 2018 season for many on the jury, SAO Alternative: Gun Gale Online turned many of the judges expectations for a series tied to the oft-maligned Sword Art series on its head. What really carried the show into its eventual spot in the top 5 of the year here was the overall light-hearted sense of tone the series with its combination of comedic moments and stoy. Distancing itself from the more serious/realistic tone in the original series', instead the jury felt that GGO treats viewers to a more down to earth showcase of what gaming actually is. The show portrays games as something people play for fun, and uses the virtual world as a way to explore the concept of escapism, while still having the characters interact with society nicely contrasting the usual portrayal of the \"NEET gamer\". Karen/Llenn as the main character is surprising relatable and entirely fun with her boundless energy in game, but with real quirks and flaws that serve to deepen the audiences connection to her as she steadily learns to accept herself. Add on a colorful cast with the insane Pitohui, the bubbly gymnastics team turned badass SHINC ladies, and an absolutely hilarious dual-grenade launcher wielding loli, and you have a recipe for a show that creates an atmosphere of intense fun without sacrificing depth, and what is action without some fun.\n\nHowever the jury felt that the show took a big downturn at the introduction of Pitohui's \"death game\" plot and the injection of a conflict that wasn't really necessary for the show. In fact, they felt that the show's inability to properly balance the tonal difference between the light-hearted baseline of the show with the apparent seriousness of the conflict hampered enjoyment of what was otherwise an intriguing second half of the series, and lowered the show in the rankings because of it.",

Lifting a cornucopia of great ideas from past shows and flourishing with great, eye-catching character design, FranXX was certainly promising.\n\nSet in a dystopic future where the world's been stripped for the majority of its natural resources, FranXX sets in early to get us invested in a broad cast of characters learning how to live and love together. It does its best to keep you invested by baiting with little hints of the world they live in alongside romantic development. The jury felt it never really capitalized on anything it set up, though. We felt that the front half is alright, but the back half becomes somewhat messy and a lot of pre-established ideas start to lose their meaning. There are several episodes during the first half of the series that end up just not mattering in the end. While FranXX is still an entertaining watch, its lack of focus and foresight leave it struggling to find space for itself among the year's other top contenders.",

        "writeup": "Megalo Box was an interesting specimen for the jury. It arguably has some of the better animation and action in the category, yet the characters and plot ultimately do not hit the mark as well as other nominations did. It is certainly not one of the lowest this year, however it does struggle a bit in various areas, forcing the jury to place it where it is.\n\nMegalo Box absolutely generates one aspect very well, and that is hype. The fantastic soundtrack has a lot to contribute towards that, with its rap and hip-hop influences being utilized well during scenes, building upwards to a peak or drop right when the moment is getting intense. Another aspect is the fights, which are animated and choreographed nicely and offer a unique engagement between opponents. The direction for the show was agreed on being rather successful, albeit the choice to downscale and then upscale the visuals for the TV broadcast to present an 'older anime' appearance simply made the show appear very blurry and ruined the enjoyment for a good amount of the audience. If you were able to make it past that, your experience was likely very enjoyable. For the jury, specific story arcs shone brighter than others; such as the ex-military soldier, with others not as much; including Mikio Shirato's. The ending was a disappointing for much of the jury, simply showcasing the poor characterization and writing of both Joe and Yuuri, but the development of Gansaku and Sachio along Joe's journey was definitely praised throughout. While resting where it is among the nominations, Megalo Box is still a great show worth checking out if you have the desire, if not for the awesome fights and soundtrack.",

        "writeup": "Trigger brings the mecha genre its newest banger addition with its anime adaptation of the 1993-1994 tokukatsu series Gridman the Hyper Agent and its American version Superhuman Samurai Syber-Squad (SSSS). Inner 12 year olds rejoice as SSSS.Gridman dishes out the punishment on kaiju in a way that captures the essence of the super robot genre that many of us remember from our younger years. For those of us who aren't familiar with the genre and its roots, you'll be pleasantly surprised to revisit the past and see how SSSS.Gridman capitalizes on the tropes and feelings that are so evocative for the rest of us. It is worthy of 2nd place in this year's rankings because it does well what other shows like it strive for. It blends the tropes and feelings of its inspirations with the superb crafting and execution of a fresh story.\n\nPerhaps the most important part of bridging generations together in the mecha genre is to have old and new fans feel a similar set of emotions about the show. SSSS.Gridman hits this nail on the head as Studio Trigger has done with its different series for years. Gridman remixes references and tropes from the last few decades with its own new vision of the genre to create stunningly animated fights between an updated Gridman, and kaiju that still look as though they are awkward suits with a person stumbling around inside. Even if the references go unnoticed, Gridman excels at being well animated and directed to bring its story to life and having its audience cheering at every combination, every pose, and every finishing move that Gridman unleashes on the road to uncovering the secrets of Akane's city and the mastermind plan of the main villain, Alexis Kerib.\n\nSSSS.Gridman is another great addition to Trigger's (and former Gainax stars) catalogue of anime that captures the soul of a generation and reinvigorates its form for the next generation of anime and its audience.",

Boasting a fantastic story full of twists, thrills, and revelations, this season changed the game for Eren and the rest of Survey Corps. It's not just titans, humanity has to worry about now. The lack of titans this season allowed this new enemy to strut their stuff and present a conflict that we, the jury, found incredibly realistic and thought-provoking. There are other humans who will do whatever they can to do what they believe is right. Do you let humanity slowly trickle away in order to last as long as possible, or do you risk it all to try and save everyone?\n\nThe big reason the jury chose Attack on Titan as our winner is because...we really couldn't think of anything negative to talk about. The animation quality was a step up from season 2, the story remained action-packed and engaging, the music and sound design were top notch, the characters were believable and interesting, and more. It really doesn't get much better than this, and that's saying something considering how many fantastic Action shows aired this year. The jury was most excited to see Levi back in action after he was benched due to injury at the end of season 1. Speaking of which, Attack on Titan shone brightest when it wasn't focused on Eren. In fact, Eren is actually sidelined for much of the season in favor of best girl Historia, having most of the plot revolve around her.\n\nAttack on Titan is the definition of a show that just gets better and better. While season 1 was definitely full of hype moments, it's easy to see how far behind it is in terms of complexity when compared to seasons 2 and 3. While it's a damn shame the season got cut off in favor of a split-cour, there's no denying that what we have right now of season 3 is a wild ride. The Armored and Colossal titans are still a threat, and so Eren and the Survey Corp are on their way to avenge all the lives lost due to the attack on Wall Maria five years prior. And judging from how that teaser in the middle of the final ED, not everything goes according to plan. Studio Wit wanted to remind viewers that Attack on Titan is a brutal show, and we are eagerly anticipating what's to come.",

All Might's got ample shine as his duel with All For One was considered by many to be the highlight of the entire show. It encapsulated the tradition of hype and never giving up that has been engrained into the show, all delivered with one huge punch. Which is unfortunately a minor negative, because outside the Bakugo vs Deku fight, the jury found the choreography of the fights this season lacking. But the emotion of the moment and the character work with our main characters was more than enough to carry the rescue arc, which was the high point of the season.\n\nUnfortunately, it is the licensing arc where things take a turn. The jurors agreed that this was the worst arc in the series, dragging down the action and pacing. If it weren't for the last 3 episodes, with the Bakugo/Deku fight and the introduction of Mirio, the jurors would have thought about ranking the show even lower. However, there was still complaints that because of Mirio's introduction, the season ended on an unsatisfying cliffhanger.\n\nThis season was the ultimate mixed bag, but generally left the jury with a positive opinion on the show. However, they could not ignore it's flaws, with the second half of the season dragging down the series immensely.",

We’ve witnessed magical quests spanning an imaginary continent with Grancrest Senki, the development of the changing world of Overlord across two more seasons, a kingdom delving into its dwindling mythologies in Maquia, a twisted tribute to the fantasy worlds in Goblin Slayer, and the expansion of mythology to create a world of magic in Mahoutsukai no Yome. This year had many fantastic adventures so this jury found itself a wealth of shows to journey through. Not many entries were quite enough to find themselves an Anime of the Year nomination, but the genre lives on strong through a surprising variety despite the wealth of isekai which we have seen. And so with full passports and aspirations, we enjoyed our adventure through 2018.",

Getting the larger problems out of the way to make room for the things that were more enjoyed, the pacing for the first 8 episodes felt lightning fast, leaving behind a massive exposition dump and some lackluster character introductions, asking the question if this would've worked better as a longer series (3-/4-Cour possibly). This coupled with the lack of a very compelling antagonistic force throughout the series and some problems with consistency in the story caused it to fall a little lower on our list of shows. Despite not having too many dynamic changes with the cast, one of the more enjoyable aspects of Grancrest Senki was with the characters and their relationships. Grancrest gave us some fulfilling relationships fairly early in the shows run time and seeing them grow as the story continued on made Grancrest entertaining to watch. These relationships along with the genuinely fun main cast of characters and the consistently solid animation made Grancrest an enjoyable adv/fan show to watch.",

Unlike typical action thrillers, It doesn't demand your attention by ramping up the tension to a grand crescendo. Instead, they use the animation, which gets just as cool as it does goofy, and the soundtrack, a silky smooth jazz bop, to miraculously make the gang's wacky antics as nonchalant as they need to be to look cool, continuing what has made the franchise so beloved over its 50 year run.\n\nSurprisingly, Part V gets more topical and political than most anime dare to. Issues having world-wide relevance (not just Japan!) are genuinely thought provoking and give the action room to breathe, but their focus and applicability to the main cast prevent them from feeling bloated or unnecessary. The cast itself is instantly likeable; Lupin is the infectiously confident and charming lead to the equally iconic side cast, friends and foes alike. The patented Lupin Crew™️ may only be 6 characters, but each one is irreplaceable and quintessential to the group chemistry.\n\nPart V has places to go and doesn't wait for you to keep up. It's on a roll and whatever it attempts, it accomplishes with basically more polish, charisma and heart than anything this year.",

As a debut film, it looks absolutely beautiful, creating a rich and enchanting fantasy world with the Iorph and dragons in just under 2 hours. The worldbuilding in the movie is fantastic for its length, establishing a great setting of where our story is taking place. The immaculate visuals bring the setting to life even more through gorgeous backgrounds.\n\nIt also tells a wonderful story about the tale of raising a kid when you aren't ready, as well as presents the concept of outliving your children and the ramifications of it. The jury enjoyed the first half of the movie with the tale of Maquia raising Ariel in a fashion similar to Wolf Children, and it was a wholesome story that hit the right emotional beats. Maquia herself was very well liked among the jury, with Ariel losing favor among them during the second half.\n\nThe main complaint of the jury was the general lack of compelling side characters and their arcs. Leilia and Krem were not that compelling, and the jury wishes that they would have spent more time of Maquia raising Ariel instead of focusing on the side characters and the plot revolving the war. The jurors felt it was tacked on a bit and strayed away from the stronger aspects of the film. Regardless, many enjoyed the conclusion. As a first-time director, Okada visually impressed us, making it an easy choice for it to be a strong nominee in our awards this year.",

Of particular note were the side-arcs that the show later built upon, and the supporting fantasy cast (shout outs to Neville, Silky, and Ruth), as well as the art-style and sources the fantasy elements are drawn from. More divisive were the main characters, Chise and Elias. While some thought Chise's character arc and portrayal of a badly-damaged human were compelling, others found her boring or one-dimensional. Her relationship with Elias (and the framing of that relationship) also came under fire for being somewhat disturbing without being properly explored. Elias was also a character the jury had mixed feelings on, with some finding him creepy or bland, and others finding him compelling.

The various kingdoms are given a much bigger role, as well as a focus on administrating the various projects the Tomb of Nazarick has going. However you would be amiss to discuss those seasons without mentioning the lightning fast pace at which they were going, cutting out many fan favorite moments in lieu of covering more volumes. Despite this the jury found the climaxes to be rather uninteresting and very rushed. There is also the strange decision to animate more things in CGI, reminiscent of the critically bashed new Berserk adaptation visuals. Indeed it does both anime and source fans a disservice to see the most anticipated scenes not only rushed, but terribly produced. If you can look past all of that, you will find an interesting dark fantasy show that decided to focus more on the dark part these two seasons, as well as bringing more of the same feelings we yearned from the first season by basking in the greatness that is Momonga.",

Multiple poor directorial decisions (including CGI mistakes and poor cuts) ultimately hurt the potential audience; source readers included. Yet what shortly followed provided one of the most intense and enjoyable experiences of 2018. Golden Kamuy contains a wide spread of incredibly interesting characters with a lot of depth and motivation; all of which weave in and out of groups together, presenting unique situations between each other which always felt fresh and exciting. The viewer is often left wondering for themselves just who is working for who, as well as which characters are the real antagonists in the series.\n\nComedy is a large part of the series, something it absolutely has down pat. Be it the cast interacting with each other through utilizing injuries as methods of humor, the new cooking experiences for characters, and bizarre encounters or the plentiful usage of sexual jokes, there is something for everyone in Golden Kamuy to laugh to; something the jury agreed with all-round.\n\nWhile consisting of two seasons, the resounding opinion among the jurors was that the latter season especially ramped up the eccentricness of the cast as well as the plot, which also took a more serious route. Many characters paths converge towards the end of the season, executing by and far the best story arc among the nominations. Whilst its production values did improve over the course of the show airing; including some aspects such as the show's soundtrack which is incredibly fitting for both comedic and dire moments, the jury noted that other nominations were far more consistent with their quality across their entire duration. Regardless, Golden Kamuy is an incredible series which utilizes it's characters flawlessly and progresses its plot in a very satisfying manner. The jury is not joking when they say that there is a little bit of something for everyone in this series… It is hard enough as is to simply list all the genres which apply to it!",

He isn't an adventurer per say, and as the narrator describes, he doesn't let any god roll his dice. Goblin Slayer isn't on a mission to save the world nor is he interested in doing so. Sixth place may appear low for Goblin Slayer, but compared to the other shows above it that feature wild adventure romps, treasure hunts across early 1900's Japan, and beautifully crafted fantasy worlds, Goblin Slayer plays it safe. It sits comfortably between better crafted and executed shows, and those that suffered from too many faults. Goblin Slayer's story isn't adventurous, nor is the adaptation of the source material. Instead of a more mature dark fantasy experience with a well grounded premise, White Fox gave us the PG-13 reduction that ultimately became its biggest weakness. Despite this, Goblin Slayer was still an enjoyable addition to the fantasy genre that managed to breathe life into a genre that has had its tropes abused by good and bad anime over the last few years. Goblin Slayer's pragmatism made the action fun as he continuously proved to be the bane of the goblins' existence while his party and other minor characters helped to showcase his reputation as the weird one at the adventurer guild. This season ultimately set out what it hoped to do: kill Goblins, and start breaking Goblin Slayer out of his shell. Goblin Slayer was fun, but ultimately felt like it pulled its punches in a category with several heavy hitters.",

Watching Chio's inner monologues justify how she gets into each of the wacky situations she finds herself in (as well as the insane imagination she has in relation to bringing video games into real life) is what drove the show's humor, making for a lot of creative skits that stand apart from what a normal school comedy would bring. However, she's not alone in this show, with her partner Manana and her unlikely friend Andou being the definite highlights of the rest of the cast. Manana and Chio have a great best friend dynamic, constantly trying to either screw each other over in some way so that they can escape the situation they're in, or realizing they're in it together no matter what, and doing whatever they can to get out ASAP. On the other hand, watching the ridiculous biker gang side plot with Andou unfold made for a lot of the best moments of the series, turning up Chio's inner monologues and \"wing it\" nature to 11, really capitalizing on what makes the series what it is. Unfortunately, the jury wasn't in love with most of the rest of the side cast. The perverted homeless man, lusty kabbadi player, and kancho-loving child all created some of our least favorite skits, going a bit too far into raunchy humor rather than just being over-the-top.

Mitsuboshi Colors captured the hearts of thousands of viewers as it followed the daily antics of three little girls; the sadistic gamer Kotoha, the shy diligent leader Yui, and the witty energetic nincompoop Sat-Chan. Mitsuboshi Colors portrayal of kids was frighteningly accurate as they entertained themselves and annoyed others with various activities. Activities ranging from simple hide and seek, visiting the zoo, and a massive Halloween survival game. Watching these three kids with complete freedom \"save\" their town typically sent viewers on a nostalgia trip and was simply relatable. The show also has a lively and diverse supporting cast from police officers, older students, shop owners, and more. None of which are overbearing and most of them offer encouragement to the colors, try to promote creativity within them, and understandingly join in sometimes. A vibrant environment enriched and brought to life by all the loving characters which sends a beautiful message while simultaneously creating an endearing atmosphere. The character designs and models for the three girls were basically the same which is disappointing however the costume design is impressive. The Colors typically wear such a wide range of expressive well designed clothing multiple times per episode. The characters, interactions, and nostalgia really sell the show but despite this the show is plagued with poor production(ex.

Perhaps it's the change of medium, but many of the jokes that were funny in the manga didn't quite land in the anime. In fact, Grand Blue is at its best when it's not focused on comedy. Scenes that actually involve diving or Iori's fear of water are some of the best in the show, and gained great praise from the jury. It's just a shame these scenes were so scarce.",

        "writeup": "Zombieland Saga is in an interesting placement because a pretty good portion of the jury felt that the show started to move away from comedy more into character drama as the show turned from what appeared to be a parody of idol shows to an idol show with zombies. An example I can give is that I think a lot of us thought that the bad CGI was there just to make fun of other idol anime, but after they kept using it it became apparent that it's just bad CGI. There is no doubt that the start of the ZLS was explosive, delivering what many of us consider to be the best within the category. I think we wished that this sense of freshness could have stayed with us for the entire run. That said, we did appreciate them trying to promote some more character development, especially for Saki and Lily and saw Koutarou's performance as a standout within the show. Generally, we expect to see a follow-up season to start to flesh out the rest of the cast and further expand on some of the teases we saw near the end of the season. We are tentatively excited to see how a potential sequel might help to fill in some of the gaps that were left from the first season.",

His quest for peace is further disturbed in season 2 when the already large and memorable cast grows even more. Saiki K was well loved by jurors for continuing on the fast-paced dialog, strong character interactions and excellent voice acting. It was one of the most consistently funny nominations, able to maintain its high quality throughout the whole two cour run. Some of the skits and arcs (and even one of the new characters) were a little weak, but the show as a whole was so good that Saiki K easily earned its number 2 spot in the awards. The side-characters continue to lean heavily into their shticks, usually to absurd degrees, and each is a good foil to Saiki in their own way. The show cycles through everyone frequently and changes up their relationships often enough that each episode feels just as fresh and funny as the last. Season 2 features more short story arcs than season 1 did and while some of them did drag on a bit, in general they allowed more character development to shine through while Saiki was dealing with the latest fiasco. Watching Saiki trying to work his way out of situations created by mostly powerless high schoolers is always a blast, and his deadpan responses and frequent self-referential humor continue to be the highlight of the show. Even among the other nominations, Saiki Kuso no Psi-nan is an overall very strong entry in the awards this year, a well-deserved second place.",

Primarily a skit show, the jury felt the show was at its best when its use of absurdist situations and physical humor was pushed to the extreme, which is a near constant throughout the show. The three main characters have an incredible ability to push a normal situation quickly into the bizarre, and the chaos that ensued created some amazing comedic moments. Pair that with their interactions with a varied and intriguing side cast, and every episode Asobi Asobase had something that could make you fall out of your chair laughing. However, hit-or-miss was the tagline for many of the jury when it came to this series, and what inevitably dragged it down to the 5th rank. The jury felt that Asobi had an overall lack of comedic consistency through the skits in each episode, as well a bit of an over-reliance on \"reaction face\" based humor as opposed to well thought-out punchlines and jokes. On top of that the voice-acting was a source of contention.

With a premise of a young girl with psychic powers being adopted by a Yakuza member, not many people would expect the down to earth story of family, support and hard work that plays out in between the high jinks situations that occurred throughout the show. The Jury felt that this is what made the show stand out from the rest of the shows on offer this year, as the emotional side of the show allowed you to really get attached to and feel for the characters while still leaving enough room for the comedy of the show to sweep you away with in its hilarity. The characters were also a strong point for the show, with endearing characters that helped bolster the comedy of the show and make it as memorable as it was. Anzu and Hitomi particularly stood out within the cast, as their situations and interactions lead to some of the highlights of the show. Hitomi and her unwillingness to say no, lead to some really funny moments as she continued to climb the social ladder, while trying to keep her private life secret from those around her, while Anzu's story of family, whether it was with the Homeless or her adopted family at the restaurant, gave us some of the most touching moments of anime this year. These things, along with some of the best comedic timing of the year, fantastic animation, a smooth and clean cut art style and some expressive VA work lead to the Jury awarding Hinamatsuri the title of; Best Comedy of 2018.",

While the jury acknowledged two standout productions from the past year - the second season of 3-gatsu no Lion along with Liz to Aoi Tori - the rest of the nominees garnered mixed reviews. The discussion leading up to the final vote consisted of a blistering war of words to determine the winner between the two frontrunners, and in the end - despite multiple shake-ups in the jury’s composition - the jury eventually settled on a ranking that is adequately representative of the state of the genre in 2018.",

Further than this, the emotional climax of the movie regarding Mizore's realization was beautifully executed and followed through with the themes of the movie up to that point.

The jury as mixed on Haikara's lead, Benio Hanamura. While she's fun and energetic, some of us felt she was overly careless and ignorant of her circumstances, and on occasion her attempts to break social norms came across as more selfish tantrums. The rest of the cast fared slightly worse, as her romantic interest Shinobu is somewhat bland, though most of the others are serviceable in their roles. Ultimately Haikara-san's age bring some inevitable problems. It's core feminist themes about Japanese society in 1918 may have resonated when written about in 1975, but don't translate quite that well in 2018. Benio more-or-less falls in love at first sight with Shinobu, and ends up being quite willing to change her lifestyle when things get serious. While the end of the first movie has her growing up quite a bit, it remains to be seen where her development goes. As such, the jury was somewhat unsure about judging Haikara-san based only on it's first movie, but more than enough of both it's good and bad aspects were on display, and none of us were particularly impressed.",

The hour-long film presents a lesbian romantic couple during their high school years and details their personal struggles and worries with each other as well as themselves. The production of the film was agreed upon as being very well done, with great direction, lovely background artwork and animation, as well as a charming soundtrack. The main complaints revolved around the drama throughout the movie. Much of the screen-time focuses on Yui; a fairly timid girl, who very much so loves Tomoka; the tomboyish female lead but doubts her feelings due to her personality and traits that Tomoka has that she wishes she had. Her inability to move forward on her own or communicate her thoughts easily (albeit being more forward than many other characters this year) until later in the film creates some drama that is taken in and painted as being both too typical of the genre and irritating for the viewer. Not being the only Yuri centric show in the nominations this year, many jurors gravitated towards the alternative as a preferable option. However, Kase-san still does stand strong as a wonderful observation into the ongoing relationship of two quaint lovers. It has many cute and fluffy moments to squeal over, a fair dashing of drama, as well as some moments likely to make even you yourself blush. In the end, Kase-san is a very refreshing romance entry for clientele with an open mind and who are looking for something more personal or relatable for a romance.",

The story too predictable at times lost its grip on the Audience. The music often crept out of place. And Kyouko might as well having been non-existent.

The unique art style and creative direction made the show stand out from a visual perspective, and even the most reluctant of jurors have to admit especially against this particular group of shows it stands out as one of if not the best looking show in the category. It's ultimate placement in the category will leave virtually everyone unhappy though, and this is in large part due to the divide on how well the show accomplishes its storytelling. Those of us who had the show as the best in the category will cite the story being as unique as its visuals. To some it was a compelling study into the nature of obsession and passion, and how easy it is to get those confused and to get lost along the way. They see it as a tale of two people learning from each other and growing from those lessons. Not everyone saw it that way though. The show's transition from a romance setup to a character drama proved to be a sticking point for many, whether it be how that transition happened or that it would be better if it stuck to either one. Some members of the jury thought that Akira's arc was handled poorly, while others thought it was Kondou's arc that was handled poorly. There were as many people praising the visual storytelling as there were people criticizing that same show's heavy handedness. This unsatisfying compromise of a ranking is the result of that fairly big divide in opinion.",

The show does a great job of showcasing some of the sacrifices that must be made when devoting yourself to your partner and how this impacts the time one would usually spend on their hobbies. The jury felt like the two main couples shared some pretty special chemistry and with some well timed comedy and expressive voice acting performances there was a plentiful amount of laughs to be had to top it off with some really heartwarming moments. The shows mediocre production and the somewhat abrupt and unwarranted introduction of Kou and subsequent lack of development towards the end of the show were two of the main complaints the jury had with the show. Although it didn't place extremely high in our rankings Wotakoi is a well executed office romcom and is recommended for anyone looking for a warm, light hearted and fun show with an interest in otaku subculture.",

The lesbian romance of the year finally showed itself in Fall and TROYCA certainly did a fantastic job with it. The jury felt that the Bloom's portrayal of innocence and immaturity of young love was handled with incredible grace and poise. Through Yuu and Touko's emotional confusion, Bloom Into You portrays the truly heartwarming and beautiful moments that can exist even within the follies and struggles of immature love. With a stunning usage of \"golden hour\" lighting, and shot composition that places the viewer in the moment, the show makes it easy for anyone with similar experiences of young love to relate to the characters- Bloom Into You is simply 2018's definitive show about \"Hatsukoi\", or \"first love.\" Falling in love while also figuring out who you are is difficult and confusing, and sometimes people are hurt in the process. Bloom Into You is a reminder that these periods of youth can still hold incredibly sweet and heartwarming moments. Bloom deftly manages the various and sometimes contradictory aspects of self-discovery and love almost perfectly, and this nuanced approach made it the jury's Romance of the Year.",

The jury agreed that the starting arc with Mai and Sakuta was the strongest as it showed our main characters at their greatest and the relationship between to two was phenomenal. The chemistry between the two was genuine and it helped guide the show and the humour was on point as well specifically in the early stages when these two were featured. Futaba and Kaede were great supporting characters that helped contribute to both the dramatic and fun elements of Bunny Girl. This show took a unique spin on the Harem trope similar to the Monogatari series. Unfortunately there were some debates over the other character arcs. There was a divide on the Koga arc but in general they were still positive. Nodaka’s arc was almost unanimously deemed the most disappointing as she was far too undeveloped before being placed in the spotlight. Overall, Bunny Girl was still an incredibly entertaining watch that balanced both the comedic and dramatic elements impressively and the overarching storyline of Sakuta’s backstory kept the show intriguing for all 13 episodes.",

        "writeup": "Slow Start took many by surprise in the winter season as being a stand out slice of life, with its strong comedy and light-hearted but genuine depiction of anxiety. The comedic pacing is excellent, with precise timing such that the jokes don't take too long to play out, but they don't whiz by too quickly either. The characters all bounce off of each other well for some really lively conversations that never feel stagnant. But the characters aren't just there for comedy, as Slow Start contains some outstanding character writing. The show uses its characters in tandem to work towards its message that everyone has their own secrets and insecurities, and while trying to work through those insecurities is important, it's also ok to have them, and take your time figuring these sort of things out. Slow Start's nature allows it to both explore these insecurities and the issues that stem from them, while also proving a happy, wholesome experience for the characters, and in extension, the audience. The power of Slow Start is being able to not only express the issue, but also show acceptance and support for the insecurities that people have. Finally, the incredible character animation serves it excellently, sometimes helping various gags land better than they may have otherwise. However, the shows visual achievements end there, as poor backgrounds and a mediocre art style don't serve it very well. Additionally, a couple characters just fell flat with lackluster development and comedic potential, with Kamuri being the most notable example. But Slow Start's strengths made it a show that the jury widely agreed was deserving of its placing as the 2nd best slice of life of 2018.",

        "writeup": "Cardcaptor Sakura: Clear Card is a fresh addition to the classic Cardcaptor Sakura franchise which both updates its world and visuals while building upon some of the series's strongest elements. In particular, Clear Card develops its main cast as Sakura has strengthened her magic and a new threat looms on the horizon. The show does silence its old cast of cards for its new ones, but the changes in how the human cast interacted is what most captivated the jury. Syaoran and Sakura's relationship blooms in this season, providing some cute and touching moments, and watching Syaoran learn to accept Sakura's growing power as stronger than his own makes for some great dynamics. The series provides many pleasant Slice of Life moments which, coupled with the light and beautiful visuals, give the old cast a new air and room to interact in fun ways with their likeable new addition, Akiho. These Slice of Life moments are what so well sold the jury. As for its placement, what held it back compared to some other nominations was its lack of urgency in regards to its main plot. We were persistently reminded of the ever-present threat looming in the background, a threat which was acknowledged by the characters, but seldom acted upon, especially by characters who had knowledge of it, and this lack of urgency left the series unended and the jury divided. While many of the jury felt secure in its Slice of Life moments, the constant reminder of this major plot and lack of action by the characters on this threat left some jurors less supportive, and so Clear Card fell somewhat in the jury rankings.",

The art style captures the essence of fantasy while being intricately soft to provide a sense of healing. The character designs are very unique and moe thanks to miniaturization but remain realistic to their size. Despite some consistency issues, the world shown through the lens of our two tiny leads remains fascinating thanks to the show's vibrant background art. Finally, the laid-back soundtrack completes the relaxing atmosphere that rendered the jury blissfully comfortable.\n\nThe dynamic between the two leads was interesting to witness. Hakumei is the energetic driving force of the duo and Mikochi is their source of stability. They seem to be polar opposites, but they bounce off of each other well and express their closeness without the physical intimacy or overtures that other shows require. However, some jurors found the two to be lacking in defining characteristics and notable interactions, but most agreed that the show is about going with the flow instead of making waves.\n\nHakumei to Mikochi set a high bar for the iyashikei subgenre, but its downfall came from the show's innately subdued pace, which wasn't well-received by everyone in the jury. In spite of its flaws, Hakumei's compelling visuals and unparalleled atmosphere managed to secure the show a spot near the top of the rankings.",

Further than this, the typical adventure-esque standalone mountain climbing episodes continue to be a staple for both the main characters and the wonderfully fleshed out side characters. Backed by the wonderful animation and backgrounds present in every season of the show, Yama no Susume has solidified itself as a standout in the genre over the years, and the jury has nothing but praise for the show - landing it in first place.",

These learnings weren't often about how to panel or sketch better but rather learning from different experiences and perspectives to give their manga's that final piece that was missing.\n\nOne of the strong points of the show was the characters and the interactions they had. The fact each girl embodied the manga genre they worked in made for some rather unique and fun moments throughout the show. But the characters weren't just parodies of their works, with traits such as Tsubasa's reliability and Ruki's understanding nature coming across to make them feel that bit more real and relatable to the viewer. The way the subject of anxiety and insecurities were handled was something the Jury praised for the most part as well, as they felt it to be quite accurate in its portrayal between the 4 girls leading to some good character moments as well as some of the highlights of the show. The comedy of the show was a point of contention within the Jury, as some felt it fell flat or was overused at times throughout the show, while others really enjoyed it and felt it added to the shows charisma.\n\nThis didn't deter the Jury's overall enjoyment of the show, for the most part, and it's relatable characters, unique character interactions and portrayal of insecurities led to Comic girls being awarded 5th in this category.",

The show consistently charms with the cute interactions between its two leads, Nishikata and Takagi. The amount of comedic material that the show is able to get out of just these two, with little to no interaction needed from secondary characters, without feeling completely stale is rather impressive. The show also manages to avoid letting the constant teasing that Takagi dishes out from being mean spirited, clearly showing that it comes from a place of affection, and using it to progress their relationship, keeping things light hearted. Some fairly strong voice work from Takahashi Rie and Kaji Yuki helps to further endear the audience to the characters. However, the jury felt that some instances of poor pacing hurt the potential much of the comedy routines had, and that certain sketches overstayed their welcome. Additionally, in a year where most candidates had some impressive visuals, Takagi simply doesn't measure up to the competition in this department, with minimal animation and backgrounds that were sometimes indistinguishable from each other. Finally, some jurors felt that when the show was focusing on the trio of girls, it lacked much of the charm that made it endearing in the first place, and we would have liked to seen better integration of them with the main characters. While the jury was charmed by the interactions and loved the ideas the comedy had, the inconsistent execution means that it just didn't quite stack up to the competition.",

The show does not hold back in exploring when situations escalate and become chaotic due to these characters, and it culminates with a conclusion that can be a bit jarring.\n\nThe jury felt that although Happy Sugar Life maintains good visuals, solid directing, and good sound quality, the show wasn't a high priority against the other nominees due to unlikable characters, uneasy plot lines, and just a generally less compelling narrative when compared to its peers.",

        "writeup": "Heaven's Feel is the Third Route in the main Fate/Stay Night franchise, and based on the movie it might be shaping up to be the best route yet. The one thing this movie nails is atmosphere, with a constant air of unease that is shown in the warm yet cold colors surrounding the environment. The visual direction is remarkable, save for some uncomfortable uncanny valley effect involved in the Lancer fight. Besides that though, it truly is a treat for the eyes.\n\nThe mystery is also set up very well. Sakura and Shinji take the spotlight as more agency is placed on Sakura, and the mystery of how she is connected to all this grows throughout the movie. The sudden appearance of Zouken Matou and Assassin significantly shakes the foundation of the story in a positive way. Add to that the mystery of the seemingly omnipresent shadow, as well as Saber's doppelganger, and there are a whole host of mysteries leaving us thirsty for more.\n\nUnfortunately, mysteries are most satisfying when they are resolved, and with this being the first part in a trilogy, we don't really get a resolution or answers to our questions. It does a wonderful job setting them up, but it just can't afford to answer any of them yet. And unfortunately, it's a big enough problem that it fell out of favor for some of the judges. Regardless, it is a great entry into the long running Fate franchise.",

        "writeup": "Banana Fish is an 80's crime/drama story come to life and modernized in an ample fashion. The story follows a young gang leader, Ash Lynx, in his perilous journey as he confronts the mafia leader that raised him and several other prominent forces. The early focus of the story is on discovering both the mystery behind the drug Banana Fish as well as what happened to Ash's brother, Griffin in Iraq. The first half of the story is a gripping narrative focused on mystery, revenge, and tragedy with several climaxes that make for one of the most entertaining stories of the year.\n\nThe second half of the story focuses more on the relationship dynamics between Ash and several key figures in the narrative, such as Eiji and Dino. Ash's relationship with Eiji is the cornerstone of the story as we explore a very intimate and deep, yet pure relationship that serves to humanize our protagonist and soothe his loathsome past. Ash's association with Dino comes up as the central conflict in the story with several twists and turns that seeks to allow Ash to directly confront the source of his inner demons and struggles since childhood.\n\nThe jury felt that this story was very promising and exciting as it weaved interesting conflicts and dark themes together in a grounded and moving way. However, several plot developments and a controversial ending caused the show to lose some of the cohesion that was built up from the start.",

        "writeup": "Across the board, the jury came to the consensus that Steins;Gate 0 was simply not as good as the original. However, this pseudo sequel-prequel still ended up being an overly satisfying experience. Steins;Gate 0 is very much a fan-service of the series for the original story. It re-introduces all of your favourite characters; now slightly older, in similar situations as before, while slowly trickling in new focal characters to get the story rolling. The comedy remains relatively the same; albeit being a bit more broad going off of the larger cast and availability of the previous entry to reference, yet proceeds to offer lots of entertainment.\n\nThe tone and feel of the show does try to continue to exist; unfortunately not being identical due to the new staff team and director, however it does hold up very well and offers an interesting and fresh take on the series. As an adaption of the Steins;Gate 0 visual novel, it does its best job depicting the multiple intertwined routes in a single storyline. The intense and rather gloomy moments are handled wonderfully, such moments as Okabe's trauma explored at the start of the show are delivered well and tend to leave a big impact on the viewer.\n\nThe jury agreed upon Steins;Gate 0's weakest aspects being it's action sequences and general plot points. Various events including the military's involvement appeared very messy in comparison to the original, as well as other shows in the category. Many parts of the story did not line up nicely as the show progressed or fell short during reveals or surprises, but the overall structure was solid and displayed properly. While the jury did compare Steins;Gate 0 frequently to its predecessor, among the other nominations, it holds strong as a successful experience among us and would definitely be recommended for fans of the series to pursue themselves.",

        "writeup": "Out of all the phenomenal work to come out in 2018, Devilman Crybaby emerged as a title that managed to inject a copious amount of nuance and experimentation into a thriller/mystery format that successfully justifies itself as a piece of art that stands up to its source material.\n\nThe show focuses on a boy named Akira Fudo, a shy, sensitive boy who unearths the existence of devils within society and ultimately merges with one in order to protect humanity. The show is incredibly polarizing with its ultraviolence, unique art style, and gratuitous sexuality; it certainly is not a show for every taste, but it simultaneously utilizes these elements in an artistic way to amplify its story, characterizations, and themes.\n\nThe show has a great, engaging setup throughout the first half of the show as its builds its world and plot. However, the show can certainly be divided into two halves, and the transition between the two can be seen as slightly hasty. However, Devilman's ending is a provocative one, rife with opportunities for varied discourse and interpretations about its overall meaning.\n\nThe jury took great pride in deliberating on the visceral subject matter and allegorical interpretations of the story's motifs, even if there were contrasting viewpoints. This is primarily why Devilman was chosen as the top pick amongst the jury.",

Some of those shows are notably absent, which should speak to just how strong the year was for dramatic characters. While we did want to showcase as great of a variety of strengths as possible, the jury did come across something rather unexpected that threw a wrench in that-- in spite of the many potential nominations we considered, after watching Liz and the Blue Bird we almost unanimously agreed that both leads of the film were nearly equally deserving of recognition for their portrayals.That opinion is clearly reflected in our rankings, and while After the Rain’s Kondou in particular was quite close to unseating one or both of them, we came to the consensus that both Nozomi and Mizore were in fact the two strongest dramatic main characters of the year.\n\nObviously, that is not to take away from the other characters nominated this year. Kondou is a intricate character that has to balance his past mistakes against his current lifestyle and a renewed desire to rekindle his passion. Hidaka is incredibly self-driven and serves as a fantastic love letter to arcade culture. Shirase’s journey is a focal point of a well-loved series, and culminates in one of the most emotional moments this year. Violet’s emotional growth over the course of the series was a joy to watch, and finally, the main pair from Bunnygirl Senpai are memorable for their enjoyable interactions and top-tier banter. Admittedly our nominations may have looked a bit different without the public’s picks, but nonetheless this jury is pleased to be able to present 8 of this years strongest dramatic main characters.",

She’s a shy but driven person who takes hold of a hobby she had only a tangential interest in, and turns that into something she can enjoy and take pride in.

What sets her apart from other characters of the same ilk is the way this story is told. The unspoken moments lend her such strong characterization, and given how few words she actually says, the moments she chooses to speak and the words she chooses to say really have an incredible impact. She is someone who instantly becomes very easy to root for, and watching her realize her value as a person was an absolute treat.

While the two main characters are complementary to one another, the jury found the way that Nozomi bears the responsibility of the situation they are confronted with to be more compelling than Mizore’s explicit realization and confession. Liz, at its heart, is the story of two friends realizing that their relationship is holding each other back. The jury resonated with the complex emotions and decisions that the seemingly carefree and selfish Nozomi displayed early on, and the sheer amount of courage and maturity put on display by Nozomi following the performance scene. The film highlighted the stark contrast to the flippant yet desperate for validation nature that she exuded, showing the subtle yet rapid development.

Unfortunately once her arc ends, she does feel somewhat underutilized, as her interventions into the plot seem to focus a bit more on the role of “jealous girlfriend” than seems to befit the confident character that has already been shown. That said, she clearly does have plenty of her own insecurities which continue to be explored over the course of the show (though unfortunately not with the same level of care as in the earlier episodes, as she does generally play second fiddle to whichever girl’s arc is the current focus).",

But acerbity is a double-edged sword. Sakuta's mannerisms, while at times amusing and entertaining, can be lacking. Like many other main characters, Sakuta is able to solve every problem that he comes across.

The show would not have been even remotely as good without a character of her strength. Having said all that, she often suffered as a character in the comedic moments.

Despite this, she remains extremely positive and optimistic about everything around her, going out of her way to cheer up and help out her fellow dorm mates as they struggle with their own problems, as well as having blind faith that through hard work she'll get the manga serialization that she has always dreamed of, despite how bad things look now. This all pays off in the final few episodes of the show with Kaos getting a character arc of her own in which all of her dorm mates help her out instead, letting her grow to be a bit more confident in herself and her skills, and ultimately landing her an insert manga. However, the main detractors for Kaos found this bit of development to not be enough, as even at the end of the show she still has plenty of confidence issues and problems with her manga art, along with the fact that they were a bit more lukewarm on her brand of humor. At the end of the day though, between the comedy she provided and the character development that she did have, Kaos was largely agreed upon to be one of the best comedic characters of the year, earning a spot near the top of our rankings.",

        "writeup": "Rin is portrayed as an independent character that prioritizes solitude. However, she exemplifies gap moe through her obsession with meat and her unusual affinity with dogs. Moe is especially important in shows like iyashikei since it’s one of the main methods by which iyashikei achieve a sense of relaxation. Developing platonic affection for the characters certainly helps the intent of healing that otherwise wouldn't be there if the characters were rougher and brutish. That said, aside from those traits, Rin doesn't have much to offer. Her character traits are rather plain and she's utilized poorly in the show; as she’s mostly seen strolling around the camping grounds to highlight the scenery. Plus, the climax of her character arc - her coming out of her shell to go group camping with the cast - wasn’t done well since she still had to be convinced by Ena, which diminishes the impact of her supposed self-growth. Finally, as a comedic character, her role as the tsukkomi is limited because of the nature of iyashikei, in which the comedy isn't exactly boisterous. Thus, the show’s boke characters - the Outdoors Club and Ena - don't really go far with their antics, and Rin's retorts thus come off as snarky rather than funny. Taking everything into account, Rin is a decent fit for the show but her character traits are pretty commonplace. Aside from being utilized poorly by the show, her moment for development was also fairly unremarkable. Thus, Rin ended up in the bottom half of our rankings.",

        "writeup": "Grand Blue’s Iori Kitahara might have made a bigger splash if it hadn’t been for a number of problems with his character.\n\n\nWhile most of the jurors agreed that one of his greatest strengths was his relatability and that most of the comedy was both funny and effective, our main criticism was that his characterization and relatability suffered by how much this conflicted with the more dramatic moments of his development. The parts of Grand Blue in which Iori learns how to swim and dive and his more serious scenes with Chisa and Aina lose their effectiveness in the shadow of the show’s outrageous comedy style. They also occur so infrequently that this growth feels disjointed and ingenuine. It’s development that happens in spite of the comedy, not in tandem with it. In other words, Grand Blue tried to balance Iori’s comedic and dramatic sides, and it felt shallow.\n\n\nThat said, Iori is a relatable character. The way he betrays his friends at the drop of a hat when the right situation presents itself, the lack of awareness that he is often the perpetrator of his own suffering, and the sense of powerlessness he feels as a frequent victim of his clubmates were gags that worked well for Iori. The serious moments helped flesh out a character who also aspired to become a better person and overcome his fears, even if they conflicted with the general tone of the character.\n\n\nIori does a good job of fulfilling his role, but he lacks the depth and balance that was needed for him to stand out more among the other nominees for this category.",

Her selfishness and deadpan demeanor mean that in a variety of situations and settings she is able to perform the role of being the straight man (tsukkomi) or the funny man (boke). Hina is able as a character to perform this switch almost flawlessly unlike many other comedic characters. She can use her innocence and stupidity to compel the people around her to do something only to switch into being the straight man and ludicrously mock all of the individuals that are in the situation. Obviously, Nitta is the primary receiver of these slights but that does not minimize its effects. Furthermore, her powers are cause for sudden inserts of the random and the insane that is ludicrously funny, ensuring things never get stale. These powers are also cause for a large amount of dramatic irony that the show uses for humor. The downside to Hina is in the fact that you feel bad for those that have to deal with her and exasperated at the state of affairs. Also, this kind of humor over time can also become rather repetitive and dry, explaining her position on the lower half of this category.",

He doesn’t have depth and development going for him as a character, but he makes up for it in spades with his vast comedic range - ranging from pop culture references, self-referential humor, genderbent humor, multiple instances of breaking the fourth wall, and so on.\n\n\nSaiki oftentimes finds himself in the most absurd of situations primarily because of his psychic abilities; which allow for some incredibly novel scenarios and resolutions. He’s also surrounded by a massive cast of boke characters that highlight how snarky he is based on his retorts. But despite their transgressions to him and his peace, he still cares about them, which is part of his allure. His interactions with the oblivious cast as well as the outrageous base setting for the show is the perfect storm for comedy, as almost every interaction is a manzai skit.\n\n\nSeeing that Saiki is at the center of all the humor of such a refreshing comedy, it’s fair to say that the show wouldn’t be as critically acclaimed without him. While Saiki did have some detractors from the jury, they also acknowledged his importance to the show, and with that, Saiki managed to pull away for the win.",

His attitude and his way of berating the girls as both a boke and tsukkomi was consistently entertaining, hilarious, and never got old. It helped that his take on the type of character he played was fairly unique, so he kept the audience on its toes and remained a bit unpredictable despite definitely staying in character. However, there wasn’t much depth to that character at all. Most of the debate surrounding his placement in our rankings centered around how important it is for a character to develop or at least be multi-faceted. Koutarou is at most one-and-a-half-faceted, with all his depth coming from just a couple short conversations and from reading between the lines to see how much he cares about Franchouchou and its members. Sweet, but not really substantial. Even so, he did such a fantastic job with his comedy routines and impressed the jury enough that he earned a high placement among the best comedic characters of the year.",

Because of this, even among the wide field of candidates there were some obvious front runners, characters whose individual stories touched on various aspects of what it means to be human, such as passion and loss. Most of these front runners came from shows that had a particular knack for focusing on their side characters, and their stories featured substantial depth.

After the timeskip, Nozomi is shown to have strong psychic ability, and continues in her support for Souya during the final conflict, leading to the show's conclusion.\n\nHer singular focus on Souya ultimately detracts from Nozomi's potential, in the eyes of the jury.

Her whimsical nature, steadfast determination, and earnest pursuit of friendship with the co-lead Mizore attracted appreciation from the judges, but it is her actions and thematic resonance as a foil to the co-lead Nozomi that truly set her apart. While Nozomi and Ririka both share an airy and light affect, Ririka’s consistent effort to break through the barriers Mizore puts up stands in stark contrast to the seemingly neglectful way Nozomi maintains the status quo. This contrast sparks a change in how Mizore relates to others, and serves as a catalyst for the final confrontation between the two leads.\n\nIf there is any criticism to be made of Ririka herself it would be that unlike our first and second place picks who had unusually fleshed-out character arcs, many jurors felt she did not have enough screen time to compete. While this could be seen as a shortcoming of the film medium instead of the character, this lack of focus occasionally makes her relationship with Mizore seem motivated by personal gain rather than friendship.\n\nBeneath the surface, however, Ririka is wonderfully complex. Her efforts at seeking companionship with the aloof Mizore are based both in an earnest desire for companionship as well as a more centered desire to improve her own skill. With woodwind instruments, particularly those that use a double reed, it is especially difficult to produce good sound and resonance, which is why learning from Mizore is a goal for Ririka. The journey to seek acknowledgement and validation from a mentor, as well as to forge a genuine connection, endeared Ririka to the members of the jury. For those reasons, Ririka places highly in this category.",

Her character isn’t merely that of a mentor, however, as she is also struggling with grief and guilt over losing her best friend, Shirase’s mother, during their last research trip. For this reason, returning to Antarctica is as much a necessity for her as it is for any of the girls, and she is especially invested in helping Shirase to find the answers she needs to move on.\n\nGin’s interactions with the girls set the stakes for the trip, as she impresses upon them how dangerous venturing to the edges of the Earth can be. She also serves as one of the emotional cores of the narrative, whom the audience can look to in order to understand the void that losing Takako created not only in Shirase’s life, but in the lives of her fellow expedition members. When Gin finally allows her feelings to erupt towards the end of the show, it primes the audience to feel the full brunt of the impassioned climax of the series.\n\nSome jurors felt that Sora Yori focused on Gin too rarely for her to be considered as strong a supporting character as others in the category, and that some of her interactions with characters could be construed as emerging out of narrative convenience rather than a natural extension of her personality. Perhaps with more screen time Gin would have been able to rise a few spots here, but she nevertheless remains a very effective character.",

Even though Yanagihara is coming from the position of a nine-time winner with a clear “home field advantage”, it feels almost impossible not to root for him as he aims to claim the title of Eternal Kishou. His strength comes from a sense of personal responsibility to those around him as he aims to push even further forward into the world of shogi regardless of his doubts about how much longer his body and mind will allow him to continue. Yanagihara is confident and boisterous, but he is also full of doubts that he badly wants to cast off not for his own sake, but for the sake of those around him. The show does an excellent job of portraying these two sides to his character with charming social interactions as well as beautifully realized sequences focused on Yanagihara’s own uncertainties, making Yanagihara the jury’s undisputed #1 pick.",

Even as she herself realizes what she is doing, and feels disgusted by it, she continues because the alternative―receiving absolutely no validation and having to simply live as herself―is more terrifying. Simply showing her that she’s valued as a friend is a remarkably simple solution that is easily executed, but it is effective thematically. The show doesn’t try to moralize about the rightness or wrongness of Futaba’s actions, but it does demonstrate that there’s absolutely a better way forward. Her arc presents a remarkably even-handed and sympathetic treatment of contemporary youth anxieties and is therefore one of the more thematically relevant conflicts of the series.\n\nAt the same time, most jurors felt that outside of her own arc Futaba only really functioned as a device for exposition, driving the narrative forward with incoherent pseudoscientific explanations. Her crush on Kunimi felt fairly contrived and irrelevant to her character arc as well.

Because of this, it was fairly disappointing that the arc was more about Sakuta, and that lack of focus is something that worked against her when we compared her to other characters here, who took more of an active role during their own arcs.\n\nIt was quickly pointed out that she was fairly effective as a comic relief character, and since that’s her role in most of the Bunny Girl episodes, it should be clear that Kaede has plenty going for her.

While its events have an effect on many different characters, and there's a lot to like, its biggest selling point is unquestionably its relatability. There are few who haven't experienced the effects of bullying in some form, either directly as victims, or indirectly as friends or relatives of victims, or even just as bystanders. And in the center of that arc is Hinata Kawamoto.\n\nHinata’s selfless actions upon seeing her friend being bullied are a true inspiration. Despite the fact that there are no benefits to sticking her neck out, she does so anyway, simply because it’s the right thing to do. Despite the hardship this ends up causing her, she stands by her conviction that getting involved was not wrong, and essentially proclaiming that even knowing how it would turn out, if given the chance to do things over, she wouldn’t change a thing. This persistence and determination, combined with her usual upbeat and open demeanor, are a one-two punch of likability that works on most everyone. This does not apply only to the audience rooting for her; it applies also to the characters in the show who are affected by this arc, most notably Rei, who grows as a character as he attempts to support Hinata in this time of trouble.\n\nIf there is criticism that can be made of Hinata and her role in this season, it would be that Hinata herself appears to emerge from this ordeal unchanged and unmoved. In a sense, this is certainly a testament to her strength of character, but there is also the slight feeling of flatness as a result. It is certainly nothing to mar her entire character -- as the ranking clearly indicates -- but its presence cannot be denied.",

This was especially advantageous to Fuka, who was strongly advocated for initially by one of the jurors, leading to the rest of us to look at her more closely and agreeing with them, ultimately resulting in her final rank in third place.\n\nAfter catching up on the shows and making sure each juror would be discussing the characters with the same amount of familiarity, we completed our initial write-ups and began discussions on the characters and the category itself. One large discussion was about what should be under consideration when analyzing a comedic character, leading to us ultimately deciding that depth outside of a character’s comedy, including dramatic development, should be considered in the overall strength of a character. This ended up being crucial to Anzu’s final ranking in second place.\n\nOnce discussions concluded, we cast our final votes for the award, leading to the results you see today.\n\nAlthough the category occasionally had some heated discussion, Supporting Comedic had a dedicated jury that faithfully executed its duties to their fullest extent, ensuring every character was considered, each nominee got in on their own merits, and that every viewpoint was heard.",

Aiura claims her spot by standing out amongst the crowd. Not only does her gyaru aesthetic leave her visibly different, she’s one of the few characters that can pose a threat to Saiki without it being accidental.\n\n\nWe didn’t discuss this nominee at much length because, frankly, there’s not a lot to discuss. She comes in midway during the second season and immediately helps freshen things up to keep the comedy from getting stale. She highlights new sides to already existing characters and helps deepen our understanding of the already wide roster. Unfortunately, she’s hamstrung and kept from climbing higher by a lack of screen time and no real opportunities to develop on her own past her introduction. While her presence on screen is a joy, she just didn’t shine bright enough for us to give her a top 4 finish.",

Indeed there is a special kind of comedy to be found when a character acts in the way he isn’t supposed to, especially in a comedic setting. What manages to raise his character above and beyond a normal support character, however, would be his character growth. There is something special in seeing someone grow and change thanks to their interaction with the main cast of a show, even more so in a comedy show. Andou is one such example, despite receiving limited screentime, as befit of a supporting character. Such an endearing character is, without a doubt, one of the best of 2018.",

This comedic relief really allows LLENN to take her role seriously without making the show feel like too much.\n\n\nA few of the criticism’s and weaknesses we noticed with Fukaziroh that held her back was her not really having much development or depth as a character, and her generally limited screen time in the series. While not being huge glaring holes in her character, there were a few other characters who shined a little brighter in these aspects that we simply couldn’t ignore.\n\n\nOne more thing I would like to touch on is how well she represented the persona of someone who just enjoys dicking around and having fun with video games. From choosing the most unorthodox weapon in the game and dual wielding it to trying to see how many guys will hit on her with her randomly generated loli avatar, she embodies the spirit of someone who plays games for enjoyment.\n\n\nSomething about explosion’s and Loli’s just works well together.",

While most jurors enjoyed the comedy provided by the contrast between Teruhashi’s outward behavior and her inner thoughts (courtesy of Saiki’s telepathy), a few jurors felt that her comedy failed to develop in novel ways, particularly considering this was the second season. Her other gags, including the halo that typically surrounded her character, her being “blessed by god,” and her attempts to maneuver out of certain social situations were met with similar disagreements.\n\n\nHer characterization was also a point of contention. While many jurors felt that she was largely a static character, others saw changes in her attitude towards Saiki and her role as the perfect girl of PK Academy that allowed her to feel at least somewhat dynamic.\n\n\nHer cast chemistry was limited but effective. In a show revolving around Saiki, chemistry with him is the only real requirement, but she offered notable chemistry with numerous other characters, including new additions to the cast. Although her interactions with most male characters were fairly same-y, the exact nature of the situations often allowed the gag to stay fresh, and her chemistry with the female characters proved to be more varied.",

His frequent betrayals of Iori, his frequent betrayals by Iori, and the suffering he endures alongside Iori from the hands of everyone else in the show drive most of Kouhei’s comedy. The common theme of the jokes mentioned above, however, lies in that one name that gets repeated: Iori.\n\n\nThe most common criticism of Kouhei by the Supporting Comedic jury was that his comedy was too reliant on his interaction with Iori, and this in turn led to him feeling like an extraneous character. Outside of his identity as an otaku, which, admittedly, offers us some of his funniest, most relatable scenes, Kouhei can only be defined by his relationship with Iori. There are practically no scenes with Kouhei interacting with the other characters.\n\n\nKouhei does a solid job as a traditional, supporting, comedic character, but only to the extent of its most basic definition. His lack of depth and development past his interaction with Iori ultimately proved him to be an almost entirely one-dimensional character.",

Others appreciated the physical comedy and how she acted as comedic relief for many of the more tense scenes in the show. Her polarization also expanded to her character development with the jury divided on whether her small interactions were endearing or just throw away moments. There was even a level of divide on exactly how funny we thought her actual comedic moments were. Some of us were wondering if she’d ever regain her full senses and stop acting like… a zombie.

        "writeup": "The resident daughter of 2018, Anzu managed to capture the hearts of all of the jury, as well as the public, catapulting her into the top two slots, and just barely being edged out by Hitomi in the final rankings. Anzu acts as the foil for many of the goings on in Hinamatsuri, and at the same time is the heart of the series’ more emotional moments. The jury felt that her ability as a character to mesh together comedic potential and dramatic growth with her trademark kind-hearted naivete in her interactions with the world surrounding her made her of the most well-rounded characters in the category. Experiencing Anzu lose everything, and slowly building an appreciation and love for the little things in life, along with showcasing the struggles life can bring when you have nothing is an incredibly mature theme for a gag anime like Hina, and really served to flesh out the deeper emotional aspects of the show without coming off trite in the juries eye. But what brought Anzu to the top was her ability to create comedic moments off of that dramatic tension through her varied interactions with the cast. The jury felt that her dynamic characterization made her able to support the rest of the cast incredibly well, pinpointing new parts of their personalities, and deepening each other characters in their own right.\n\n\nHowever, despite all these positives some of the jurors felt that balancing act between her dramatic and comedic sides at times led to a weakening of impact in any given scene, which dropped her a peg in the face of Hitomi’s comedic tour-de-force. All in all though, it’s Anzu’s ability to make you both laugh and cry that cemented her number 2 rank for those in the jury.",

These factors, taken together, made the jury’s top pick for Supporting Character in a Comedic role.\n\n\nProbably the most consistent response to Hitomi was simply that she was funny – the funniest character in a show that was well-regarded by the jury, in fact. Her comedic scenes offered an excellent variety – irony of all types were used to create comedy, be it the direct irony of an ideal middle schooler who nightlighted as savant bartender or the dramatic irony of her teacher falling for her ruse. Her role in most comedic scenes as the straight man had variety just by means of the show continuing upping the ante of the ridiculousness she found herself in. Rather than interrupting the absurdity, she simply goes with the flow, only occasionally offering one of her excellent reaction faces.\n\n\nHowever, she’s more than the butt of a joke – she offers some pretty notable chemistry with a notably wide cast. Her interactions were varied with the many characters she found herself in scenes with that gave her a very fresh feel. She also serves a critical narrative function as an essential catalyst for many skits throughout the show. To round her out, she even has a fairly compelling dramatic arc. Paralleling her increasingly absurd comedic arc, she ultimately finds herself in a life she never wanted. It’s only after a housewarming party at her new apartment and specifically a conversation with her mother does she see the value in what she does, which caps her character arc with notable growth.",

During the first half of the series, he presents himself as a main Antagonist for Ash, constantly trying to outdo him and ultimately kill him. This all comes to a head during the one-on-one encounter in the train station, where it is later revealed Arthur managed to outplay Ash and cause a great amount of difficulty for him. A common discussion concerning Arthur was how effectual he was as an Antagonist, especially considering Ash proves capable of turning such an overwhelming disadvantage into a victory. Behind the scenes, Arthur does an excellent job of turning most of the street gangs against Ash allowing for the encounter on the train to begin with, all of which does make Arthur somewhat difficult to evaluate. After much discussion however, it was decided to put Arthur near the bottom of this list. Whilst All for One might feel more threatening, Arthur has a more direct presence throughout his series, and does manage to cleverly trap one of the two main protagonists. Arthur however is a lackey to his core, and as much as Arthur is ultimately one of Dino's henchmen, he does not represent Ash's final obstacle to overcome.",

However impressive that mountain is, though, being nothing more than a monolith is not enough to deserve a nomination on this list. It is in the final arc of Megalo Box, Yuuri’s arc, where he goes from an intimidating force to a fully fleshed out character, one taking strides not only to challenge Joe but to realize his own dreams for his own reasons. He has no cliche tragic backstory; he is not merely someone’s pawn by the end, nor does he exist purely for the protagonist to defeat. He is more than just a bundle of stereotypes thrown in a well sculpted package. Yuuri is perhaps the most fleshed out antagonist on this list, and it is only the ambiguousness of his antagonist status as Joe’s friendly rival(rather than being a direct villain like many on this list), perpetually dragging each other higher, that kept him in 3rd Place.",

This introduction, and his following fight scenes, can only carry him so far though. After much discussion, it was agreed that Kenny, for all his charm and bombastic personality, is largely irrelevant to Attack on Titan's overall plot. He is not Eren's antagonist, he barely speaks 2 sentences to him by the end. He is Levi's antagonist from the beginning, and the two revolve around each other from the moment he is introduced. This relationship makes him strong as a character, but lacking as an antagonist. Straddling that line, as he fights for the same things as our protagonists, but using different methods.

His impact on his series is also second to none, as in only 2 episodes he shakes the world of My Hero Academia to its foundations. Fundamentally altering its landscape, even in defeat, such that the consequences will reverberate through the series for years to come. His intelligence, cold with and arrogance combined with a terrific performance by Akio Ootsuka made him a treat to watch on screen. However, those 2 previously mentioned episodes are the crux of the issue, and we can only take this season into account. His screen time was minimal, however strong he was during it, and his relevance while in prison quickly plummeted. It became clear that, as an antagonist, he was All Might's obstacle to overcome. Not Deku's. At least, not in this season. However All for One's story is not yet done! With My Hero Academia still running strong, and another season on the way, perhaps we will see him again.

His madness lended him an air of unpredictability, his military training granting him the power to do whatever he wants and his position the authority to see it through. The premise of the series also makes his goal clear, even if his methods are anything but. Combine all of this and you get an antagonist in the same vein as DC Comic's Joker. Tokushirou Tsurumi is, arguably, the lynch pin of Golden Kamuy as he is one of the first and most consistent representation of the series more off-kilter style, before it dives head first into it. Bridging the gap between gritty realistic period piece and wacky comedic shenanigans. Simply put, we the jury believe that Golden Kamuy wouldn't be the same without Tsurumi, and that his special brand of insanity brings new life to any arc he appears in.

These combined strengths held Akane up high in the year, and may have even done so in a year with much stronger antagonists in general. Unfortunately, her role in the show is somewhat undermined by the presence of the mysterious mostly-unexplored ‘true’ antagonist assisting her in her conquest for intrigue, making for an anti-climactic ending to some degree.

With that said, the jury felt that we had a good selection for our top 7 overall. As a jury we tried to look at how each cast member was used in relation to other cast members, how well they faired as standalone characters, and how strong each cast member was given the runtime of the show. Many factors were considered when judging, but those three things were imperative during our discussions. Our top two (Golden Kamuy/3-Gatsu S2) were heavily debated, as was Hinamatsuri vs Saiki S2 but overall, we were quite happy with the rankings given.",

Creating a cast of characters that can utilize all of those is difficult line to balance, but the show that excels in that arena and thus earned a spot in the top cast listings was Saiki K.\n\nSet as a sketch comedy show, Saiki K takes established characters from its first season and new characters from this one and throws them in different scenarios and situations. The ease with which all of the characters are able to bounce off one another highlights how well the cast has been developed. From the exceedingly idolistic Teruhashi to the chuuni psychic Kaidou, each character has an established identity that is fairly static and grounded. Because each character is developed into their own niche, comedy can be mined from throwing them into different situations that best suit their personal traits.\n\nWhile this type of cast is not rife for dramatic character development, it would be a disservice to say that the cast suffers as a result. Rather, Saiki is a show whose cast is perfectly suited towards the show and humor it goes for. It is for those reasons that Saiki K is on our list.",

Hina and Nitta make a great pair throughout the show with Hina being useless and emotionless whilst Nitta learns to be a caretaker for Hina struggling through the new craziness of his life. Hitomi is a model student and human being. She can't say no to anything due to her kindness, which gets her into multiple hilarious situations throughout the entire show. Anzu is another great cast member whose personality does a complete 180 during the show, leading to really personable and feel-good moments. The supporting cast throughout the show also does a great job at making each moment more unique and add flavor.\n\nWith this said however, some jurors weren't too fond of either the comedic moments or the dramatic moments, but most of the jurors liked either one or both of these aspects.

To guide all of these personalities toward success, you need an even more dominant character to manage them, and Kotarou provides that with all the wild abandon that an unshackled Mamoru Miyano can squeeze through a microphone.\n\nHowever, some jurors felt that while these characters excelled in the comedic moments of the show, they somewhat clashed when the show delved into more dramatic material.

An adaptation of a popular light novel series, Bunny Girl Senpai's cast mainly consists of our intrepid hero, Sakuta, and several girls suffering from a puberty syndrome whom he is able to help. There are standouts in this cast, namely Mai. An unusual heroine, Mai is able to go toe to toe with Sakuta and be an equal partner in life and in love. However, the rest of the cast is uneven in quality and staying power, especially in a show that refocuses itself every few episodes. Some of the other constant characters are Futaba and Kaede; the former for her advice in solving the supernatural occurrences, the latter because she's Sakuta's sister. Unfortunately, we don't see much of the other characters in the cast, like Tomoe and Nodoka, outside of their arcs, and then only in support roles. In addition, the characters often feel unoriginal, especially compared to other light novel adaptations. Much of the character interaction involves Sakuta, which decreases the potential for variety and hurts the show in a category that is concerned with casts. Ultimately, Bunny Girl Senpai suffers from light novel syndrome, and its cast doesn't stand up compared to some very strong contenders from 2018.",

One of the primary strengths of the cast is the how the show really take the time to dive deep into key character's emotions and thoughts. The absolute highlight is the portrayal of the Kawamoto family. While in the first season they were very charming but somewhat lacking dramatic depth, season two takes the time to give them some impressive development in the bullying arc; not just Hina, receiving the most focus, but also what effects Hina's hardships are having on the rest of her family and Rei. It also ensures that it spends time developing some of its side characters, such as Yanagihara and the realities of how life changes as we age in the incredible Burning Field arc, or what we learn about Souya, and how being at the top isn't all it's necessarily cracked up to be if key things are lacking in your life, a point which is used to compare and contrast to Rei, and show a glimpse of what his future could have been like had he not met Kawamotos. However, some jurors felt that the show failed to develop certain side characters it didn't get the chance to focus on, such as Hina's friend, or Kyouko playing a much smaller role than in the previous season. These minor issues are what hold it back from taking the top spot, but with all of its strong points, 3-gatsu no Lion was the jury's clear choice for second.",

Animation is at its heart the study of how objects and people move, and then the careful application of it. In that regard, Slow Start is a case study on how to do all of the small things that bring a character to life; When Tama comes flying onto the screen her twintails dance along in perfect sync with her when Hana faux drowns during the swimming episode her melodramatic actions are captured perfectly, Eiko’s steamy moments with her teacher are captured in vivid detail, and so on. Slice of life shows typically don’t lean on their animation as the main delivery system for their humor, but Slow Start bucks the trend. As the show goes along the humor in the show starts to slide down into the realm of the absurd, and the animation is able to bring it to life. It feels odd to compliment a seemingly run of the mill slice of life for repeated sakuga sequences involving hair, clothes, and small details, but that’s just what Slow Start is.",

First, KyoAni’s style must be addressed. For Violet Evergarden they chose an art style that is firmly rooted in realism. In this style people have correct proportions of people, characters stay well in their frames, excessive attention is put into small details like hair and clothing, the colors used fit the natural world, and so on. Simply put, the show is animated in a way that can only be described as if you took film and turned it into animation. This style is core to the question of “is Violet Evergarden the best animated show this year?” For most of the jury, this astonishing realism is something incredible that should be lauded, while the dissenting opinion was that it was disappointing because animation can be so much more. However, KyoAni has gotten as close to the truth of their style with VEG than they have with any other work they’ve put out; Nothing else even comes close. Everything that happens on the screen is exceptionally detailed when someone starts to walk, their hair and their clothes perfectly follow along with what should happen, when Violet types on her typewriter, each finger moves flawlessly and the mechanical parts of the typewriter click with satisfying precision.

All of this considered, the jury feels that Violet Evergarden is the best animated TV show of the year.",

We have shows that perfectly capture the aesthetic of good old classic anime like Megalo Box and Lupin the Third part V. We have shows that used its unique character designs to create something completely their owns like Hisone to Masotan, Devilman Crybaby and Hakumei no Mikochi. We have show that goes beyond excessive and realistic details in the name of Violet Evergarden. And then we have Koi wa Ameagari and 3-gatsu no Lion that are the cream of the crop. When it comes to actual ranking, there were a fierce contest within the top 2, and several shows from the same tiers, but ultimately we are all happy with this final ranking.

This is best represented through its lanky and cool character designs, focusing on extremes, while not adding too much detail, which allows the show to easily animate its cast in an expressive cartoony manner.\n\n\nThe thick outlines and bold colors on its characters contrast with the painted backgrounds, which fits the french theme of Part V. This received a mixed reception with the jury members but ended up being counted as a positive, rather than a negative.\n\n\nLupin's biggest flaw lies in its inconsistent use of lighting, which is made even more obvious by the contrasting backgrounds mentioned above. The shot composition manages to capture to stylish charm of Lupin, quite similar to its older iterations, despite being pretty basic.\n\n\nLupin III feels like a mix of James Bond and a comedic western heist movie, creating something truly original you don't see in modern anime. The contrast between modern and classic is well represented in the shows art style, but it ends up failing to rob 4th place, due to Hisone & Masotan's more polished production.",

Character, and dragon, designs are rounded with little to no sharp edges that allow for stylized and fluid animation. These character designs are core to the show’s visual success and appeal because they let the quirks and attitudes of all the characters come forth. The dragons are goofy and act a bit like big lovable dogs and the art style is there to support their affectionate behaviour. If this show was done in a more standard style a lot of the goofier moments would fall flat and Hisone to Masotan would lose almost all of the charm that it does have. The backgrounds were split between the base and the sky. The jury felt that the base background were a bit dull, as military bases often are, but that the art for the skies that the pilots and dragons soar through were beautiful and well-composed. In particular, the lighting and clouds for the sky shots were excellent. All of this together made for an anime that was reminiscent of Saturday morning cartoons, which felt fresh in this medium and was a delight to watch.",

It truly feels like an animated fairytale storybook with its hand-painted-then-printed looking texture, special paneling effects, and stubby character designs. The Jury was charmed by the fun way the scale and proportions of the natural backgrounds and oversized props were used to emphasize the small stature of the world’s elvish inhabitants. Color was also used well throughout the show, making use of both soft, mellow colors for the homes and the cities to instill a delightfully homey feel and vibrant, natural colors of the forest and surrounding naturescapes to emphasize the show’s connection to the woods. What was most frequently praised by us jurors was the sheer level of detail in all of the show’s designs. The city shops are filled with wares, the character designs are full of fun patterns and colors, and little inventions scattered around reveals a lot about how their tiny societies function. However, the Jury found that Hakumei to Mikochi’s art style was perhaps not as unique as the two nominees above it, with some concern that its nature-centric design and forest environments have been done before. Even so, Hakumei to Mikochi’s incredibly charming and storybook style and world-building scenery secures it a very strong third place.",

However, on top of being immensely detailed, Koi wa Ameagari also manages to use this style to its absolute fullest extent through beautiful scenery that sets the tone well, incredible use of shot composition and closeups to make for one of the best examples of ‘show, don’t tell’ this year, and gorgeous style shifts that are used sparingly but beautifully.\n\n\nKoi wa Ameagari’s attention to detail and usage of visual storytelling is unmatched this year. Not only is it one of the most technically well-executed styles but it’s also used to its fullest extent and manages to stand out among shows going for similar realistic styles. It’s intricate and well thought out which shines through in every part of the visuals. It’s no doubt one of the best uses of detailed realistic art in a long time but only ends up taking second place because the jury preferred and appreciated 3-gatsu no Lion’s visual flexibility, expressiveness, storytelling through aesthetic and unique style just a little more.",

The style isn’t just a simple nostalgia gimmick, it’s used efficiently as a tool for world-building to sell the poverty filled urban setting of the series. The characters all look unique and recognizable, and while we didn’t find the boxing gears particularly memorable, they certainly established the show’s own identity. Sadly not every aspect of the art was as well utilized. Lighting and other cinematic elements were lackluster in Megalo Box compared to the other nominees on our list and we weren’t pleased with the excessive use of downscaling, which became more and more distracting as time went on and was one of the main reasons why the show ended up below Violet Evergarden. We appreciated Megalo Box’s nostalgic style, but the series wasn’t able to hold our attention throughout the series due to frequently repeating, similar environments and the lack of creativity in its overall execution of the more mundane scenes.",

Typically the art styles that he chooses to use are very effective for communicating the emotion of the narrative, but Devilman doesn’t quite get there. The jury felt that the art style was, from character designs to backgrounds, sloppy and unrefined. The character designs were very basic and lacked detail, and the backgrounds were acceptable but did little to add to the story. The designs do work well for the animation that was used in the show, but even then it just didn’t impress. Part of this problem stems from Devilman Crybaby being an adaption of a manga written in the 1970s. Unsurprisingly, styles now are radically different than they were then which leads to a conflict when adapting a work from that time. Is it appropriate to use a new style for a beloved manga, or should the director try and stay true to the original work? Devilman Crybaby ended up somewhere in between where it didn’t manage to either particularly effectively. Because of this, the jury felt that the show has one of the weaker art styles of the nominations. This was disappointing because Yuasa's works are often brilliant in their style and direction.",

        "writeup": "3-Gatsu no Lion is the jury’s pick for the art style of the year. Shaft managed to incorporate myriad unique art styles into the production allowing them to perfectly match an art style to a particular scene. For example, scenes with the Kawamoto family used warm colors with ample lighting to express the positive healing effect they have on Rei, when Master Souya is on screen a tranquil feeling is created by using white and other light colors, backgrounds are sometimes eschewed in favor of a monochrome backdrop to place all emphasis on the foreground of an important scene, and powerful metaphoric imagery litters the show. Shaft’s style often tends to be polarizing since they can go so far out with an idea and abstract it to almost absurdity. Fortunately for 3-gatsu, this is one of Shaft’s more focused shows where they reigned in a lot of their creative flair and saved it for just the right moments instead of letting it go wild all the time. By appropriately picking and choosing when to use their more creative styles Shaft was able to elevate the show. The narrative of emotionally charged scenes is lifted up and pushed higher than seemingly possible by these decisions. Truly, the art style is phenomenal.\n\n\nIt was a very close decision between 3-gatsu and KoiAme, and the deciding factor for first place was how many different art styles 3-gatsu was able to use successfully.",

For artstyle, the show benefits greatly for its detailed, and gorgeous settings as Violet goes through several locations for her jobs. It’s one rare production where all the background characters are fully portrayed with their own costumes and figures. Unfortunately, we feel that this level of incredible set pieces, while standing well on its own, don’t add up much much to the narrative or world and are lacking in visual identity. In addition, we are mixed with the use of lighting and filtering. Scenes happening during the nights are often too dark, and the way the show uses and blurry focus lens work for the show’s detriment as they are distracting and unnecessary.

KoiAme is particularly subtle and likes to tell a lot of its story through its camera, focusing on key elements like Akira’s scar when appropriate, framing events through eyes, POV shots, or reflections in a windshield to portray impact, emotion, and thoughts of a character, and adding color and effects to specific scenes to paint them with the dominant emotion at any given time. Without these elements, the story wouldn’t have nearly the impact; it would be lost without the gentle guidance behind the lens. Rain too is a common motif and not just one used for sadness either. The harsh downpour during Akira’s second confession is one of determination, not sorrow. The light mist at the end of episode three is one of blissful peace and comfort. The camera specifically brings these subversive emotions out of the rain, adding necessary light and framing to achieve these effects despite the heavy coding of rain in stories. There wasn’t much doubt of KoiAme’s brilliance in the category, and it very easily earned this spot from the jury almost unanimously.",

The Jury agreed that, with its dynamic colors, wild angles and experimental composition, Devilman is truly an experience. This is a show that isn’t afraid to take artistic and creative risks, most of which were received positively by our jurors. First person point of view shots run the risk of feeling awkward in a less well produced show, but here it throws the viewer fully into the madness, allowing them to experience a bit of the same emotion Akira does as he’s naively thrown into a world of demons. It makes scenes that are already very visceral - both in terms of subject matter and its use of color - even more so. Devilman even manages to critique the audience as voyeurs of the debauchery, reminding us of this fact with literal shots through a camera lens. Our jurors also appreciated the way Devilman uses its shot composition, visual metaphor and lighting to convey its moral and religious themes. While a traditional color palette is initially used straightforwardly to represent good (white) and evil (black), Devilman’s smartly subverts those colors and cleverly uses lighting as it goes on to make the audience question just who the real monsters in the show are. However, there was some concern that the religious imagery and allusions were a bit too heavy-handed at times. Likewise, while there were certainly some strong highs, compared to some of the higher ranked shows on this list, Devilman had more middling moments, hence its position on this list.",

Early in the show, life is bleak and boring; Kimari’s own inaction is reflected in the dim lighting and static, claustrophobic shots. But once the adventure begins, the cinematography starts to focus on the scale of their journey and the framing indicates just how small the girls are compared to everything else. The cities are big and busy, the ship they ride is massive and the sea and sky extend for ages. As the characters visit those wide-open vistas, the camera focuses on the movement through these landscapes. Be it trains, birds, or people, motion becomes a very important motif to the show, including, of course, the three girls running through Shinjuku.\n\nWhile Sora Yori does a good job of setting the big scenes with its cinematography, where it starts to fall short compared to the other nominations is that the character moments and more “slice-of-life” scenes tend to be pretty standard. The other shows featured a lot of the same kind of composition as Sora Yori’s landscapes, but they also managed to include impressive camera work to quietly show off the emotions and motivations of their characters, embracing a more show-don’t-tell fashion than Sora Yori did.

        "writeup": "One of the big surprises this year in terms of cine had to be SSSS.Gridman, a mecha show with more heart than it had any right to have. What one may initially perceive as another mecha show from a tired genre is actually a poignant narrative with a strong juxtaposition of normalcy and our desire for fantasy. There are many striking elements in the shot composition throughout the show--from the massive kaiju that litter the backgrounds to the shots of entrapment and isolation that underscore key character arcs that develop throughout the show. The show also plays with persistent imagery and symbolism that may at once seem a bit grating, but leads to interesting revelations about the characters and the world around them. The battle scenes are executed as a love letter to the nostalgia of older mecha legends such as Power Rangers and Mobile Suit Gundam. While these scenes often shelve some of the strong mise en scene elements depicted throughout its more intimate character moments, they successfully emulate the viewer’s affinity to the mecha of yesteryear and allow the viewer an unencumbered window into its stunning fights. Additionally, the final sequence is a true break from the convention of contemporary anime and stands apart as a must-see moment. Despite its general strengths, it remains the most divisive picks among jurors. Some felt the admittedly well composed shots didn’t always carry the depth necessary to truly make it an outstanding contender and therefore ranked it below its arguably hefty competition.",

        "writeup": "As always, Shaft aims to impress in this category with its trademark style, and the second season of Sangatsu no Lion is no exception. It has incredible use of color that fills every scene; from the cold blue lighting of Rei’s lifeless apartment, to the warm, comforting yellows and oranges of the Kawamoto household, or even some of its more neutral choices like the shogi hall, it is always working to set the proper atmosphere. Within these scenes, it varies its aesthetic with use of incidental color from shot to shot, either catching the viewers attention with intense hues, or softening the mood with light pastel tones. With some incredibly dynamic camerawork, Sangatsu uses diverse shot placement to keep the viewer’s eye actively following the subject at all times, rather than letting it rest for too long and boring the viewer. It also excels at using clear, easy to read metaphorical imagery, while preventing it from feeling hamfisted by keeping it within the imaginations of the characters like in the burning field arc with the sashes and the titular burning field. Finally, the use of locations as motifs serves to subtly indicate to the viewer where Rei is mentally. Does he need to reflect internally for a little while? Send him for a walk across that gorgeous cable bridge. Is he actively seeking advice? He’s probably doing that at the school, a place of learning. Sangatsu no Lion captivated the jury from start to finish, easily earning its place in the top 2, but just missed out on the top spot in the face of its excellent competition.",

The revue duels are undoubtedly their most memorable sequences. The fights have strong storyboard to begin with where many shots are taken from interesting camera angles and they are used well to indicate power balance of the duel. The lighting is symbolic that further highlights players’ state of mind. Outside the revues, in the slower moments, the show remains equally impressive. It’s one of the rare shows where the visual is expertly crafted that even if we can still grab the context even if we turn off the audio and subtitle. The camera is sometimes used to add comedy into otherwise, at least to an extent, serious scenes. As examples here we have Hikari repeatedly appearing out of nowhere close to Mahiru in episode 5, or the amount of time Mahiru tried to wake Karen up early in episode 3 being shown with some very seamless cuts at the same time as Hikari got dressed and left. Other than that, Revue Starlight showcases many stunning visual symbolisms (symmetry images, the clog rewinding). While the jurors agreed that the level of cinematography of Revue Starlight isn’t on par with the top two choices, it has a smart visual-storytelling that put it to the third spot of this year’s category.",

        "writeup": "Violet Evergarden is a show that excels in visual production and wears it loud and proud. The jury however felt that the cinematography wasn't quite its strongest point. Sure, there’s plenty of skillful shot composition involved, mostly subtle shots placed exactly where they need to be for the various stories told while ramping up the creativity during the more intense and/or emotional parts.\n\nIn many ways Violet Evergarden is absolutely a brilliant show as far as its cinematography is concerned. There's so many moments of quiet serenity, and the setting lends itself well to them. It's clear that the show is using everything in its power to tug on the viewer's heartstrings and make them care for all of it's characters. Especially the parasol scene deserves mentioning, a moment of ridiculous beauty that is completely overdone but still works.\n\nYet the show seems to be overproduced and just good art doesn’t carry the show. Some interior spaces look way too dark and drained of color, sapping too much life out of them. Other exterior shots are way too bright and washed out, even to the point of creating some really awkward looking cuts where different elements of the scene look poorly composited. You can add to that the influence of the writing’s inadequacies. Because the cinematography is so well tied together with the plot of each episode, the show’s rather lackluster selection of stories tends to bring with it plenty of overly melodramatic, awkward, or just plain unexceptional shot composition.",

Ranging from our protagonist all the way to that background character over there, the influence of character design is everywhere. 2018 introduced characters that included dinosaur girls, criminals, mythical creatures all the way to the cells within our body. This general observation is reflected well upon nominations that have been made for this category. Whilst questionable choices were made by the public, the jurors did their very best to provide their insight to present you the shows with the ‘best’ character designs of 2018. It is apparent that when character design is concerned, Hakumei to Mikochi, Hisone to Masotan, Zombieland Saga and KyoAni’s Violet Evergarden represent the new era with remarkable performances across the board. Filled with designs that were creative, detailed and displayed ease of movement, it was a job well done across the board. However it appeared to the jurors that the old guards weren’t going down with a fight. With favourites such as Lupin III and SSSS.Gridman taking centre stage once again, it made for an exciting year in character design. Ultimately, the resurgence of Cardcaptor Sakura brought forward a series that modernises the charm of the original series from 20 years back. With a wide arsenal of outfits as part of a never ending wardrobe, alongside with ingenious designs of the ‘Clear Cards’, this modern take on Cardcaptor Sakura is one that does not fail to impress and serves as the jury’s top pick of 2018.",

Clear Card abandoned the rough edges of the 90s character models, smoothed them down, which gave us a more polished look that still stayed faithful to its predecessor in charm and style. As one would expect from a Cardcaptor series, the wardrobe of Clear Card was seemingly endless and infinite and presented a wide variety of creative costumes throughout its run. And on top of Tomoyo’s fashion gallery, the show didn’t let the casual wear of the characters become stale by giving them new, trendy clothing in every episode. The series never missed a note on the new card and monster designs, they all fit the world of franchise perfectly and were always a pleasure to watch. The standouts and personal favorites of the jurors were Aqua, Blaze, and Flight with their elegant and gorgeous designs in both card and full form. Clear Card was above its competition in both variety and consistency and earned our top spot for flawlessly updating and improving the character designs of a classic anime series.",

It enhances the extremes of the characters, while not adding too much detail, which allow the show to easily animate its cast in an expressive cartoony manner. The use of bold colors on its characters contrasts nicely with the painted backgrounds.\n\n\nLupin got a basic and confident design, that make him fit every costume or emotion. Jigen is the embodiment of the old-school rule of cool, with his black dress and chill attitude. Goemon's dated design fits his role in the narrative, of being an outdated technology illiterate. Fujiko is the poster girl of the show, but embraces her womanly charm and is brimming with attitude. Zenigata got a straightforward design, looking like the most trustworthy detective out there. Ami blends in nicely with the older cast, with more modern facial features and eyes, in synch with her 21st-century hacker look.\n\n\nLupin III feels like a mix of James Bond and a comedic western heist movie, creating something truly original you don't see in modern anime. It loves using stereotypes and pushing designs to extremes, which ironically enough is what kept it from stealing 1st place from Clear Card. Certain supporting characters, mainly the villains from the 2nd arc, feels out of place. Despite this, Lupin III gracefully swipes up the 2nd place ranking, and communicates its themes and setting perfectly styling cool and comedic designs.",

The human cast all have different models and relatively simple faces, however, the shows take advantage of this by making the characters extremely expressive and show a lot of emotion with over the top reactions that fit in with the shows artstyle. The jury felt like one of the main strengths of the designs was that the characters' personalities were reflected strongly in their designs, with the dragons also matching their respective pilots. The dragons themselves are all incredibly unique due to the variety in colour and body shape and are designed in a way that allows for fluid transformation and flight scenes. What held back Hisone from the higher placed entries is the lack of costumes. The jurors were a fan of the military-styled uniforms however the casual wear was simple and lacked in variety. Hisomaso’s character designs are perfect for a show all about interpersonal relationships and this leaves it as one of the strongest picks of the year.",

However, despite the fanfare, there were also those who felt the character designs were too bland and blended in with the generally muted colors of the show. And while the characters do a good job of being realistic and blending in with the tone of the show, their more muted schemes do make them less distinct. When compared to shows with much more dynamic designs Bunny Girl did not favor as well. They lacked the uniqueness of expressiveness that other top character designs were able to have.

        "writeup": "As an action show, SSSS.Gridman was a treat for this year. It was a year filled with so many sequels, new adaptations, and callbacks to past shows and genres. The mecha genre is beloved for its beloved history and rich fandom that knows every reference, every pose, and every attack that Gridman calls back to throughout its 12 episode season. Despite studio Trigger’s efforts to save anime once again, SSSS.Gridman fell to 6th in this year’s character design rankings. Although this might appear low to some of you, it doesn’t mean that Gridman doesn’t have strong design choices that are worthy of praise. It did, however, have some stiff competition with beloved sequels, new iterations, warm and otherwise freely expressive styles, and polished designs among the other top shows in the category.\n\n\nThe two biggest strengths for SSSS.Gridman were Gridman and the Kaiju. That includes the main villain, Alexis Kerib, as well. Gridman’s updated look and coloring held onto the original’s general curvature and shape while giving it armor and colors resembling a Gundam. Though blue, red, and white are pretty universal in the mecha genre. The combinations through the support characters were also well designed bringing back the bulky and mechanical feeling additions reminiscent of the super robot genre. Through each combination, you can tell that a lot of time and love was spent creating each of Gridman and Gridknight’s variants. The kaiju, on the other hand, felt varied and appropriate considering the original material while still retaining that awkward suit/puppet feeling. Alexis also featured a sleek reimagining of the original show’s villain. Of course, the main cast of characters had strong designs with bright coloring, beautiful eye designs, and cough Rikka’s thighs. In all fairness, Yuta, Akane, Tatsumi, and Rikka are well enough designed and color-coordinated to make themselves stand out and look appropriate even though other minor characters largely feel generic.\n\n\nEven though there’s evidence for Gridman’s support characters to have been inspired by a line of Transformers figures, Samurai Calibur, Borr, Max, and Vit ultimately felt lackluster in matching uniforms. Though the series has its finer areas of character design, it ultimately fell short in expressing the human character designs while Gridman, including OG Gridman, really pulled the weight for SSSS.Gridman. It just wasn’t enough to push it higher in our ranking.",

There also are the idols that(when not in CG) look really nice. A good example of this is Saki Nikaidō, whose character design at first seems to be that of a street thug, ends up using that to her advantage by having everything be colorful and bright so you can’t miss her, just like her character in the show.

        "writeup": "Lupin pulled out all the stops this year and covers the most locations of any other anime on this list by a large margin. However, each and every one of those locations felt unique, due to the detailed, dynamic, and highly stylized look. A rainy city was painted with almost a watercolor look, while the urban centers in later episodes have a more stark look to them. On top of this, the camera is much more dynamic than other shows. Each new angle has a different background that stays consistent with all the others, even if the angle is only kept for a few seconds. However, there are a few episodes where Lupin breaks style to reference previous parts. The backgrounds often suffer in these simply because the team was trying to emulate the feel of a 70’s episode. Finally, as stylized and detailed as the backgrounds are, they often felt slightly blurry, as if there were a filter between the characters and the background. This heightened the dissonance between the characters and the background. Because both were highly stylized, but in different ways, they don’t always mesh as well as they could have.",

We as the audience are taken on a tour of a wonderfully distinct and varied subset of our own world. One of the strongest pulls for Koi Ame is meticulous and unfettering attention to detail. Whether it’s an intimate moment in the booth of a coffee shop, a quaint domestic setting, or the various facets of a nuclear street corner, the show makes it a point to fill each frame with nuance and beauty without an overt feeling of saturation. The use of color in the show is especially noteworthy and effectively uses it to consistently engage the viewer in its setting. It doesn’t oversaturate the show with color however and instead uses them to enunciate the abilities of the style rather than overwhelm a potential lack of. Additionally, the show stylishly dodges the pitfalls of many anime that are set in the backdrop of a city. There is no over-reliance on drab or grey structures; it accurately depicts the life and small moments of a city without the appearance of some kind of tomb populated only with muted colors. Overall, Koi Ame set itself apart from the pack not only with its varied executions of striking background work, but also its uncompromising consistency with this effort that persists throughout the entire show.",

On top of that with the show being an Iyashikei, the scenery should set the tone and immerse the viewer into the environment. Hakumei to Mikochi did both of these things excellently and on top of that had a large variety of detailed and well thought out styles to boot.\n\n\nOne of the biggest strengths of Hakumei to Mikochi is its use of scenery composition and lighting to deliver this amazing feeling of scale. With characters that are only about as large as a thumb, the world starts looking very different, especially in the forest. The show managed to convey this brilliantly with imagery of the plants towering above them, the sun shining through the plants and them living in unique homes made out of tree stumps, eggshells, crab cages and more. Each of these homes were beautifully designed both inside and outside, and the city environments felt vibrant through its use of fantastic colors and wooden, rustic buildings. The nature scenery had a very wide use of green colors to create a vibrant forest.\n\nAs far as shows using their scenery to the fullest extent go, Hakumei to Mikochi is among the top of the pack. In any other year, this may very well have been the winner, but the fact that its scenery composition and drawing detail wasn’t always fully optimized makes it miss out on 1st place just barely.",

While the outdoor settings are based directly on specific locations within Tokyo, rather than just copying them in as close as possible, it softens their designs with a sketch-like approach; integrating it perfectly with the show’s character designs and art style. And what stunning locations they’ve chosen, such as the grand cable bridge that Rei crosses every day, or the wide cityscape views of the riverside. The coloring uses a wide palette that is very carefully chosen to match the mood at any given point, particularly since 3-gatsu often cuts to incidental backgrounds for character reactions and thought processes. The coloring of locations serves a strong purpose for displaying the meaning that one place may have compared to another, such as the warm tones of the Kawamoto household standing in stark contrast to Rei’s cold apartment. Indoor locations are generally filled with detail that clues us in about the characters' lives, and about the location itself. However, the jury noticed that now and then the detail would take small dips in quality, particularly with certain indoor locations, and the backgrounds sometimes take a back seat in general. Fortunately, the jury felt that the positives far outweigh the minor flaws, and while they do hold it back from earning the top placement, in a year with such incredibly strong contenders, we feel that 3-gatsu no Lion in the 3rd spot is an achievement to be proud of.",

The shots of Sydney, Singapore, and Antarctica really stand out as top-notch urban backgrounds and nature shots respectively. However, there were a few issues that put Sora Yori lower on the list than other shows; namely that there was little variety in background. From a narrative perspective the boat ride to Antarctica did all sorts of good things for the show, but due to the constraints of the scenes left us with decidedly forgettable background art for a large chunk of the show. When the girls did arrive in Antarctica the backgrounds are stunning, crisp, and evocative of a wild, untamed land. While the production of these backgrounds was certainly high, the jury felt that compared to other shows on the list they didn’t do enough for the show. The photo-realistic approach is difficult to excel at, and Sora Yori is a case where it was just ok. Compared to Hakumei to Mikochi or other shows, Sora Yori’s backgrounds did little to add to the overall narrative or world-building of the show. There is some stand out backgrounds that make for an excellent desktop background, but they didn’t quite make it there for lifting the show up.",

Fuji is revealed there is a wow factor to how well the background is painted, which leaves the audience feeling just as mesmerized as the characters in the show. Throughout this show, there are many instances of the backgrounds being almost photorealistic, which at times is able to make the backgrounds more detailed than other shows. However, there are two factors that hold back the background art: the show doesn’t only take place in the camping sites, and there are times when the details of the background are obscured with blur. While the show is about camping a good portion of Yuru Camp takes place at school. The jury feels that the school backgrounds were fine, but ultimately just run of the mill school scenery. They lack the detail and emotion of the backgrounds at the campsites. While the show doesn’t use blur effects for art style as intensively as Violet Evergarden did, there are times where the backgrounds are obscured more than a little bit. Since this category is about the quality of the backgrounds, anything that takes away from their detail or impact must be considered. Overall, the jury felt that the show is well positioned with strong nature shots but otherwise falls short of the rest of the competition.",

Between more realistic scenery, such as the landscape shots or highly detailed art clubs room and magic shop, to those that are more artistic in direction, such as inside the world of the drawings or in the future world Hitomi comes from, there are plenty of backgrounds in Irozuku that stand out. However, it’s what is in between these shining moments that ultimately led the jury to place Irozuku so low on the list. For one, the art direction in the show is top-heavy, and as it goes along there is a noticeable drop in quality. And oftentimes when nothing creative is trying to be done the backgrounds do feel flat and uncreative. Having moments of unrivaled brilliance is really something, but when it comes to the cost of consistently good background art, it just falls far behind much of the competition.",

Whilst Violet Evergarden showcased KyoAni’s strengths in production yet again, it does appear that whilst it has excelled in other sectors of production, Background Art, unfortunately, wasn’t its strongest suit. Nevertheless, given the studio’s prowess, it is not a surprise that Violet Evergarden has made it onto our list of 8. Detail is the name of the game as far as background art is considered for Violet Evergarden. Establishing shots are gorgeous, to begin with, filled with a great amount of detail that is supported through the use of vibrant colours. There is a wide variety of landscapes that are observed, which include the mountains, oceans all the way to the cities and its accompanying architecture. Occasionally, shots of the starry skies and the raging battlefields can be seen as well. To the best of its capabilities, this show flaunts its ability to represent the traditional European setting and scenes often reflect well upon the era in which the narrative is set in. However, as a result of the artistic direction to focus upon other visual aspects of the show, background art was ultimately left negatively affected. The use of filters and blurs as part of the show’s attempts to focus on its characters ruins much of the high quality work that has been put into establishing the various backgrounds and scenery. The constant presence of visual effects that interfered with the background negatively serves as the primary cause of this nominee’s placement in this category.",

This is achieved through the contrasting colour palettes, one being pastel and the other consisting of dark shades. This OP is also filled with visual imagery and symbolism, with Satou and Shio falling within the jar foreshadowing key events in the show. Satou's pink hands playing with a doll-like Shio also represents Satou's control and manipulation of Shio with the castle in the background portraying the apartment that Shio is trapped within. From the usage of blood stained bags to the portrayal of Shio as an angel holding a heart, this OP is filled to the brim with meaningful and relevant shots. The jury all agreed that the song was exceptionally well timed with the visuals and some jurors felt like the song specifically during the darker and sinister segments didn't hold up. After considering everything mentioned above the jury was thoroughly impressed with One Room Sugar Life's fitting contrast of tones, overall style and stellar usage of visual imagery to give narrative relevance which leaves it in our top three picks and one of the standouts from the year.",

        "writeup": "Nostalgic Rainfall is the visualization of Akira's attraction to Kondo through dream imagery. The OP uses this concept very well to explore things related to the nature of her attraction, the way she perceives Kondo, and the way she perceives herself. The OP uses a very wide array of rain metaphors to explore themes of love such as standing together under an umbrella, being lifted up into the sky by an umbrella, Akira jumping through the puddles towards Kondo, or two raindrops forming into a heart.\n\nHidden into this OP are allusions towards the true reason behind Akira's attraction, the narrative progression of the series, as well as the ending of the show, that I will not touch upon in detail to avoid spoilers. These 'hidden' thematic references towards these elements of the show stay hidden at first sight, but as the show progresses and the audience gets a further understanding of the characters the OP takes a small twist in meaning.\n\nConsidering the aspects mentioned above, we felt Nostalgic Rainfall was a visually clever OP filled with great shots and color usage to set the tone, a fitting song, and a ton of clever metaphors and narrative relevance. The quality of the song was conflicting and seemed like a love-or-hate element to this OP, and some cuts in the OP such as the llama cut felt a bit visually random and a tad out of place. On top of that, the tone of the OP and the surface level look of it didn't work as well for the later parts of the series that focused more on Akira and Kondo's development as characters rather than Akira's attraction, making an OP focused on this aspect feel a bit out of place. Considering all these things it's a strong contender, but has some apparent weaknesses that keep it from breaking top three.",

To start off, when the opening was on, the opening was on. The title card sequence in particular was incredible, breathing life into an often neglected aspect of an opening. Featuring bold colors, explosive animation and sharp lines, some jurors even regarded it as some of the best animation among openings this year. Other standout cuts included the cut where Ayano blew away, borrowing from the idea of losing yourself in the flow of the game, and the net sequence, a clever use of an element of the sport to run through characters while also exploring the theme of Ayano as her own nemesis. On the other hand, the midsection with barebones character cards was lacking and felt out of place among these superb aspects.\n\nOf more mixed opinion was the reused cuts. While some jurors felt that the second use of cuts was somewhat lazy, others felt that the cuts (especially with the addition of about a half-second to each cut) worked excellently within the narrative of the opening after the net sequence. As far as the cuts themselves, the jurors unanimously loved them, pouring praise on the high framerate sakuga animation and excellent color usage. On the whole, Futari no Hane was a dynamic, beautifully animated opening that boasted some excellent peaks but was held back from being the best by some issues.",

Theoretically, visual overload of this magnitude shouldn't even be considered a positive, but given how apt this act of tomfoolery is as far as the show's brand of humor goes, somehow, it just works. From when the show bashes the television screen in with a nail-bat and figuratively breaks the fourth wall, to having the show loop on itself in reference to the show's narrative structure, PTE manages to incorporate symbolism seamlessly within the insanity. Some jury members did find the opening empty with regards to its narrative, but even they had to surrender to the bombastic yet bizarre presentation that kept them on the edge of their seats.\n\nThe vocals for this opening aren't exactly the best around, but Sumire Uehara's sprightly tone of singing digitalized in self-reference to the opening being held place inside a television, when paired with lively electronic embellishments and a mouth-watering bass drop, provides formidable energy that jives well with the vibrant visuals. The lyrics even contribute to the symbolism through multiple references to the show's repetitive nature, thus the song feels complete since everything contributes in pushing the show's themes.\n\nIn the end, Pop Team Epic lost out to Flashback because of Miyavi's rhythmic earworm, but even those that supported the latter admit to PTE's visuals being more detailed, engaging, and layered. Thus, it rightfully holds the runner-up position in a year dominated by stylistic openings.",

While at times its lyrics imply the show is more of a lighthearted romance than it really is, the Jury felt Kimi no Sei has some nice syncing with its visuals, with Mai's finger gun at the end being the most notable. Out of all the other nominees, Kimi no Sei has one of the most creative title sequences, utilizing sliding character tiles to first spell out the titles of the various arcs in the original light novel before finally coming together to form the show's title. In true ensemble anime fashion, Kimi no Sei makes sure to exhibit its whole cast, giving some subtle nods at the characters - like framing a dancing, bunny suit-clad Mai in movie reels to stress her television career - as well as a few clues to their various puberty syndrome effects - like Rio's image reflecting in a mirror as she walks by. However, given the clunky crowd and car CGI, unremarkable animation, incohesive direction and lack of real stylization or narrative depth, the Jury agreed that Kimi no Sei was the weakest of the nominees.",

        "writeup": "The second version of Kiss of Death comes in as strong in most areas. It's biggest strength is probably its strong commitment to the visual theme of water. Almost every scene in some way involves water or at least features the colour blue. The transitions also include things being pushed like by what looks like a current or a transition that feels halfway between bubbles and a school of fish. These all tie the OP together into a pretty visually and thematically cohesive entry. The OP is also clearly a big fan of visual effects because there's a ridiculous number of them throughout the OP.\n\nMusically, it was generally looked on positively. The vocal performance was a little controversial though. In terms of the relation between visuals and music, it has quite a strong connection. It has plenty of movement and transitions happening on beat as well as the visuals generally matching similar tones to the music throughout the OP. The syncing of the kiss and the line 'kiss of death' which acts as a centre of attention in the song was highlighted as a particularly strong example of this.\n\nWhat holds this OP back is its lack of any area where it truly shines. It's generally effective in most areas but was considered to fail at having a particularly strong point to put it above the other OPs. Once you take away the cool visual effects, the majority of the images used are uninspired character shots or just clips from the show.",

The jury appreciated how this OP is both a fun, colorful, and wacky time, but also an effective visual metaphor for the story's themes. The opening shot has Sakura delivering a energized narration as she is chased by Zombies that represent her self-doubt, but the ending sequence has rest of Franchouchou rescuing her in a Sentai-inspired fight scene, mirroring how they empower Sakura in the show itself. The journey between these two points is very interesting as well, starting out by leaning more into the horror tropes that the first few episodes focus on, then transitioning into idol imagery, before finally exceeding expectations with the action-packed finale. In the build up, multiple scenarios like the Kotarou and Romero's antics, the zombie girls learning how to dance, and the two different costume poses, are expertly crosscut to energize the OP by vying for your attention. As a package, the OP expresses how the girls of Franchouchou strive to make it to the top of the idol world their way, regardless of how different they are from the other groups. The reason it's not higher is due to the quality of the above OPs and because many jurors found scenes like the Sentai battle to be a bit visually overwhelming.",

It came out of nowhere, from an anime nowhere near deserving of it, and stuck itself in everyone's ear like a bug you don't want to get rid of. Flashback has everything an OP needs. From bright colors that somehow don't feel out of place to a style all it's own. The credits flashing on screen, each with their own color palette, sticking out against whatever color shifted urban sprawl is placed behind it. There is not a single second that Flashback is not visually interesting, as it plays with its motif of time. Flashback also manages to, between these credits, weave in aspects of its characters relationships and the premise of the story, that of time and family. All the while Miyavi and Kenken hit it out of the park with a powerful rhythmic piece and catchy vocals I will be listening to for years to come. Yet even amongst this treasure trove, Flashback shows restraint as well. Take for instance its title card, which it deftly holds until just the right time, dropping it and the beat in what one juror could only describe as an experience. Simply put, Flashback checked all the boxes so that even if it wasn't a juror's favorite, it was without a doubt a top contender. And it was this almost unanimous appreciation that secured its spot as the top OP of 2018.",

        "writeup": "Star Overhead would be a contender for best ending in most years, and this year was no different – it blended some excellent visuals, superb style, and an amazing song. The visuals were very unique – while stop motion has been used before, such as in the original FLCL’s Ride on Shooting Star and Gatchaman Crowds Insight’s opening, Insight, it appears rarely enough that it aided in cultivating a very unique style that felt well-suited to illustrating the snapshots in the life of Kana. Add in some very much above average cuts, such as the basketball cut and the phone cut, and it’s clear that it stands above many entries from a pure content perspective. Just as the stop motion feels like a homage to the parent series, the Pillows reprising their role as an artist in charge of the theme aids in the sense of nostalgia that the series is clearly attempting to cultivate – this, of course, being in addition to the fact that it’s a quality song.\n\n\nThe biggest, and arguably only, weakness of Star Overhead was that it doesn’t deliver much more than pure spectacle. While it does that in spades, the ending didn’t have particular relevance to the show outside small nods to Kana and her characterization. While this isn’t necessarily a huge weakness, when compared against I AM STANDING, which delivers on many similar fronts, it feels like a largely inferior version of another (admittedly superb) entry.",

        "writeup": "Jewelry was an ending theme that offered some of the best character animation married with a fantastic narrative to produce a standout ending that earned itself a high ranking among entries. The animation earned universal praise from the jurors, particularly the fluid character animation. For example, walk cycles are standard fare for endings, and Jewelry is no exception, but each of the many walk cycles here is notably different. The facial animation also stood out and provided a breadth of expression that allowed impressive characterization of the core cast when aided by the direction of the individual cuts, which were packed with personality.\n\n\nThe narrative of the ending was also considered a key point in its success – it tells a story that is fairly simple but largely detached from the narrative, giving it an almost OVA-like feel. It depicts Sakura’s birthday and the day leading up to it, reinforcing Sakura’s friendships and her romantic relationship with Syaoran that remains central to the narrative of the series itself.\n\n\nThe song drew mixed responses but leaned positive – the lyrics, in particular, were noted as being relevant and integral to crafting the narrative and the synchronization was exceptional at some points.\n\n\nOf course, this entry was not without weakness. The entry’s two lengthy panning shots that marred an otherwise excellent production were universally noted as a glaring issue. Also, the upbeat nature of the ending made it a somewhat poor fit for the more dramatic episodes that played during its runtime in the series. The panning shots, in particular, made it hard for the jury to consider it above the exceptional top three entries.",

        "writeup": "Yuru Camp’s ED is the definition of “fits the show” as it perfectly encapsulates the feeling the show has going for it. With a truly beautiful song in Fuyu Biyori and some simple and calming visuals, this ED carries the feeling of relaxation and comfiness that the show is known for an extra 1:46, allowing you to wind down from an already calming show.\n\n\nAs already mentioned, the Jury loves the song in Fuyu Biyori not only praising its cathartic feel and slow pace in creating the calming atmosphere but also how well it fits with the rest of the OST, acting as a great bridge between the episode’s end and the ED itself. Notably, Eri Sasaki’s airy and soothing voice and the fingerpicking style of the acoustic guitar were points of praise. Visually the beautiful shots of backgrounds and small narrative of the girls stirring awake from a camping trip fit once more, complimenting the song to really sell the viewer on the atmosphere it's trying to create.\n\n\nWhere the ED does fall short is in its ambition in relation to the other ED’s on offer this year. With very little animation involved and nothing eye-catch worthy or entirely interesting about the visuals, Yuru Camp’s ED laid back style, paled in comparison to the stylistic visuals of ED’s like I Am Standing, Star Overhead and Inkya Impulse, didn’t have the compelling narrative or interesting symbolism of ED’s like Akatsuki no Chinkonka and Last Game and didn’t have the animation quality of ED’s like Jewelry and Le Temps de la Rentree.\n\nDespite this, with its incredibly fitting ED and beautiful song that captures Yuru Camp’s ethos, Fuyu Biyori still managed to impress the Jury, earning it 8th best ED of the Year.",

It makes great use of the now, iconic visuals and motifs from the series, like Okabe’s red phone, or Mayuri reaching into the sun, to concisely and effectively convey a whole lot about Okabe and Mayuri’s relationship and mental states as of Steins;Gate 0. For example, you have an hourglass whose bottom half is Okabe’s flowing lab coat instead of sand, and another especially excellent part where a rotating assortment of laughing Hououin Kyomas create a “clockwork” mirage that visually illustrates how the stress of traveling through multiple world lines took a toll on Okabe’s personality. As we journey into Okabe’s psyche, Mayuri is a regular presence, with shot composition representing the newfound distance in their relationship. Clever symbolism is apparent in almost every shot, making it an OP one can easily dive into and spend time interpreting. It’s also supported by a powerfully melancholic song and smooth transitions that give this credit sequence a nice constant flow as we explore the characters and themes of Steins;Gate.",

        "writeup": "Hisone to Masotan uses a 1966 recording by French artist France Gall to mirror its characters’ inability to express love. The lyrics describe pining to return to a lover after a long Summer break, determined to show them how much they’ve been missed in their time apart. In the series, the characters slowly learn to accept themselves and renew their love for their dreams, and for other people. When they reach this breakthrough, it is not at all unlike returning from a Summer break, finally in touch with their feelings once again.\n\n\nThe highlight of the ED is the dance routine of each of the four main girls. They each start off barely swaying back and forth, clearly disinterested, with Nao and Eru especially annoyed, which reflects their personalities early in the show. However, once Nao frustratedly tosses a stack of papers into the air, they all start to bust out their best moves, which are smoothly animated and accentuate each pilot’s individual quirks.\n\n\nMinimalism was the name of the game in this ED, with everything being set against a white background. Some jurors felt this helped to zero in on the characters’ personalities, but others felt overall the ED suffered visually because of its sparse approach. The jury enjoyed the catchiness of the song and hearing each character deliver their own unique vocal version over the course of the show. However, there were also minor complaints about the repetitive nature of the chorus. Overall, it’s a very strong ED that didn’t do quite enough visually to stand above the rest of the competition.",

The standard 3-gatsu no Lion sets for its EDs has been consistently amazing, but I Am Standing may be a step above not just this year’s competition but also the other endings of the series. \n\n\nThe ED features gorgeous imagery involving artistic techniques and drawing styles such as watercolor, pencil sketch and charcoal, which makes for a visually varied ED. The shift in styles comes with a shift in color from black and white at the start to a vibrant, multi-colored palette near the end, pairing greatly with the song’s tone which starts off more mellow but becomes more vibrant near the end. \n\n\nOn top of supporting the song’s tone, this style also supports the narrative told in the ED of Rei’s life slowly becoming more colorful as he starts pushing back against the anxiety, depression and other aspects that have affected his happiness. The use of water as a metaphor consistent with all other EDs in the series, and it is animated beautifully.\n\n\nOverall, we felt that I Am Standing was stylistically the most visually striking ED of the year, had great narrative inclusion and featured a fantastic song by RUANN.

The show’s cast was stacked with names like Inori Minase and Kana Hanazawa who consistently give good vocal and musical performances, and it really shone in Koko kara. With a song on the same warm, comfy scale as Fuyu Biyori, it functions as a calming wrap-up to the likely drama and emotion-filled episode that just ended.\n\n\nThough primarily a slideshow style ED, the addition of the neon animations adds a cute, childish feeling to the stills as well as some much-needed movement to draw the eye. The rising sun in the first half of the ED also serves as a good metaphor for the future adventures our main cast will face on the horizon as they travel to Antarctica. The ED climaxes with our four heroines laying together looking at the stars, with animations of various arctic creatures and scenes. The constellations in the second half of the ED also serve as a good allusion to the show’s later storyline with Shirase and her mother. Some of our jurors noted how Koko kara benefits from its usage and placement as it often begins before the final scene ends, and that fading transition from show to the ending is one of its strong points. In the end though, because it was only slightly better than a typical slideshow ED, Koko kara did not rate highly among the majority of our jurors, which is why it ended in 9th place.",

Having five different versions to coincide with the five different arcs of the show was a nice touch, changing around who was singing as well as the visuals to better represent what was happening in the show at the time. These changes in visuals also provided some neat bits of context in relation to the character's arcs, such as Rio taking off her lab coat and adjusting some of her appearance halfway through to show her split personality, Tomoe running to catch up to Sakuta due to her love for him (which she doesn't even know exists herself at the beginning of the arc), and Nodoka meeting Mai at the end (as opposed to everyone else who meets Sakuta), having a standoff with her rather than walking with her. Unfortunately, the rest of the ED didn't do a whole lot to wow the jury. The cycled walking scenes that took up a large majority of the ED weren't anything special, leaving you just waiting for the bits of the ED that did have something interesting to them, really hurting it visually overall.

After the writeups were done, the gap between the jury nominations and 3 of the public nominations was evident while the judges had a clear favourite in Hiroaki Hirata that had consistently been favourable in their discussions.\n\n2017 had Rakugo which has some of the best voice acting in anime and it was always going to be difficult to top that. While 2018 could not reach the same heights that Rakugo did, it brought us a sheer number of good performances both popular among the anime community and noteworthy in technical aspects. We say this every year but once again, 2019 has some tough competition in the voice acting department.",

        "writeup": "When we talk about Voice Acting in comedy, the ability to consistently bounce off other characters and react to them is very important. Saitou Souma's performance as Honda absolutely nails his reactions and internal monologues and is a prime example of Voice Acting adding flair to character interaction. By occasionally playing both the funny man and the straight man, Saitou Souma brings Honda's character to life. He takes what would be a mundane workplace comedy and turns it into an eccentric bookseller's wild experiences with customers and colleagues. Capturing the essence of the character you voice is very important and Souma rises to the occasion to bring out the insecure and fidgety bookseller in Honda. The self-conscious monologues only serve to augment the eccentric side of him and Souma's VA work on them is very much worthy of praise. It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that Gaikotsu Shotenin Honda-san's comedic value was heavily carried by Souma's Voice Acting. Overall, the jury agreed that Honda's voice work was executed very well albeit narrowly bested by Hiroaki Hirata's stellar delivery as Kondou in KoiAme.",

But none of the players involved are as resplendent in their portrayal of their characters as Houchuu Ootsuka is as Tsurumi. Tsurumi is a very fascinating individual due to his multi-faceted personality. He's a very dynamic and passionate man, with a grand goal he wishes to accomplish. Ootsuka effortlessly brings both Tsurumi's psychopathic mannerisms and his whimsical charm to life in a way that would turn us all into 2nd Lieutenant Koito. Ootsuka has a unique talent in being able to change pitch mid-speech that adds some depth to his monologues and creates a dynamic contrast in the emotional tension of any particular scene. Whether that ends up as a comedic performance or a terrifying dramatic portrayal, it's all in that man's vocal chords. The VA jury felt that while it was easy to be seduced by Tsurumi's performance, ultimately his screen-time in the second season drifted away at times as the focus expanded towards other cast members and towards Abashiri. Had Tsurumi's role in the season's narrative been more prominent, we may have been able to hear more of Ootsuka's dulcet tones commanding us to watch even more Golden Kamuy.",

He needs to be able to ham it up like an amalgam of every 80s action hero, deflate into the emaciated, sickly husk of Small Might, while also breaking into a series of the most furious and desperate lines of dialogue we're likely to ever hear from this character.\n\nNeedless to say, the events of season 3 put Miyake's skills to the test during these four major moments: losing Bakugou, United States of Smash, \"You're Next\", and his final interrogation of AFO - and Miyake delivers on all of these scenes to a flawless degree as he both pumps you the heck up and chills you to your bones.\n\nAll Might's VA is a joy to behold, simply put, but only when the show lets him. Sadly, All MIght's character interactions are fairly limited as a direct result of being, you know, not the main character.\n\nThe relatively low placement of All Might has nothing to do with the performance of Miyake but is simply a testament to the quality on display in the top 5.",

His monologues communicate his age while his comedic moments communicate the youth inside of him.\n\nFacing a problematic midlife crisis, Hirata's performance adds some real nuance behind the sadness Kondou's expresses in his monologues. It was also mentioned among the jury that when considering standout performances, we needed to find a character that that possesses a wide range of character interactions. This was the case with Kondou, but Hirata brought another element into how varied and different he sounds when addressing each character. There's also a noticeable difference depending on the situation or even the current mood Kondou is in. The conclusion we reached is that Hirata's range is stellar, and we were pleased at how his tone always matches the scene.\n\nSuch a complex and compelling character meant that if anyone was able to breathe some life into Kondou, it would mean that we'd naturally be drawn into favouring this performance over anyone else's.

Talent is something that's consistently polished through experience and Kamiya's performance in Saiki Kusuo is a fine example of what he's truly capable of. In a show where voice acting is vital to the comedic timing, Kamiya's role becomes very challenging. What's interesting is that Saiki's performance is very deadpan which fits his character but deadpan is a consistently undervalued trait when it comes to voice acting. Kamiya's task involves maintaining that deadpan and simultaneously conveying Saiki's feelings through his consistent rapidfire internal monologues. It is truly an accomplishment that Kamiya is able to respond to all these demands in a befitting manner. What particularly impressed the jury is how well he's able to respond to the antics of the people around him. In a classic tsukommi style, Kamiya plays a very traditional role in comedy but the nature of his role is very different because of the show's structure with most skits revolving around accentuating Saiki's self-centered and indifferent personality. While the jury felt that Kamiya was particularly limited by Saiki's character writing, he accomplishes his role in a manner truly befitting of an industry veteran.",

With that in mind, a performance that executes this role well is truly worthy of praise. And that's exactly what Okamoto Nobuhiko does as Bakugou. While his range is limited, his screams sound raw and packed with emotion. However, writing off Bakugou's performance as exclusively screaming would be disingenuous. In his quieter moments, Nobuhiko captures Bakugou's hidden anger and fervent passion in a skillful manner. He brings to life the Bakugou concealed behind his superficial mask and deservedly earns a slot on this list. In episode 23, Bakugou breaks down and lets out all the bottled up emotions he was holding in. His insecurities shine through in that moment and Okamoto does a great job of giving the viewer an idea of what Bakugou has been dealing with.\n\nIn the end, Okamoto Nobuhiko rises to the occasion of voicing one of Boku no Hero Academia's most important characters while being simultaneously responsible for one of the best emotional climaxes in the show. Sadly, his limited role leaves him little room to branch out and truly display his range.

Between the solid delivery of Sakuta's witty lines and the portrayal of his underlying smugness and laid back attitude, Ishikawa succeeds in fleshing out a character that very much relies on his performance due in part to the dialogue-heavy nature of ButaYarou. However, while it could possibly be a result of lackluster sound direction or the nature of the show's writing, Ishikawa's voice acting did feel a bit repetitive and bland at times. On the other hand, Ishikawa did a fairly good job in the climax of Sakuta's emotional arc and that's worthy of praise.

Above all else, it's passionate and fun.\n\nThough there were a few scenes scattered in the anime where Miyano backed off and lent us a more serious look at the character he was playing, this didn't amount to much depth, and indeed most of the debate over ranking this performance centered around the extent to which we value depth over sheer skill at one particular aspect. The joke also didn't go over great with everyone, making his placement somewhat divisive.\n\nUltimately, though, most of the jury did have a great time with this straightforward yet fresh performance, earning Koutarou a high ranking and a lot of respect for never getting stale.",

The highlight of Teruhashi's character is the contrast between her outward appearance and inner self. On the exterior, Teruhashi is the perfect girl: good-intentioned and angelic. When she enters the room, all eyes are drawn towards her, regardless of gender or age. Her demeanor suggests that she's oblivious to all the attention she receives. In reality, this is a ruse: Teruhashi's internal thoughts reveal her large ego and how she's very scrupulous in maintaining her public appearance.\n\nTeruhashi's actually a very calculating individual and prone to frustration when things don't go her way. This contrast is the main gag of Teruhashi's character and it wouldn't work without Ai Kayano's excellent delivery. She perfectly pulls off Teruhashi's cute side while matching her drive and motivation to remain perfect. Her rapid-fire delivery in oscillating between both personas is an impressive feat. Because of this, she doesn't even have to be delivering a comedic line for it to be funny. Listening to her general dialogue go at lighting speed is entertainment enough.\n\nThe VA jury overall had a very positive opinion of Teruhashi. However, similar to Teruhashi herself, her performance wasn't perfect. While her character interactions with Saiki are great and epitomize her character, her interactions with the rest of the cast leave a little to be desired. She gives off the vibe that she's looking past the other characters and doesn't have many meaningful interactions with them. While the gripes with her performance are small, the competition this year makes these gripes stand out more and results in her being further down the rankings although it is a terrific performance in its own right.",

There's a common complaint about these anime misrepresenting that culture fairly often, but with Momose's performance, Arisa Date is very capable of selling the otaku side of her. Her dedication shows in the way she portrays Momose's fear of being discovered as an otaku and the way her character interaction changes and evolves throughout the series as she grows closer to Nifuji and the rest of the cast. Her banter with Nifuji is natural and Momose's reactions to her interests being brought up are believable. At the same time, she's able to convey emotion well in the more dramatic moments.

Everyone agreed that she did well in voicing a generally upbeat character with some depth, especially apparent in the few episodes where she was more of a focal character.

The jury also appreciated that her voice acting was able to convey the extent to which Hinata's personality was a facade through showing its cracks at the right moments. This allowed her positivity to support the other girls' more volatile emotions without putting herself on another level of maturity, again contributing to the excellent dynamic between the four.\n\nThere weren't explicit flaws that the jury found with this performance; rather, the fact there were few highlights is what kept her from reaching higher into the rankings. She did support the rest of the cast very well, though. The limiting factor is more the role than the voice actress, and it's a top-tier performance in any case.",

Violet Evergarden is a war machine, *an android devoid of emotions*, that carries out her master's every order. The series begins with Violet in bed, her stature akin to that of a military dog, still clinging to her android-like past.

The Violet in the beginning is a blank slate and as the series progresses throughout, she also transforms from a robot into a more humane form and Ishikawa's performance also evolves to match. Even in her robotic-like state you could already see cracks in her persona. When the Major comes up in conversations, Ishikawa's veneer of stoicism begins to show signs of emotions welling up inside. As the series nears its end, Violet is a whole other being, a human being with actions based on selfish reasons, and her words filled with emotion. As the series is about Violet and her transition from a doll to a human, Ishikawa delivered a performance that sought to best capture that feeling.

Akane's early performance was very smooth and lifelike despite being a facade. It's a testament to Ueda Reina's talent that she was able to capture the essence of a character with as much depth and complexity as Akane. If instability defines Akane's first half performance and insecurity the 2nd half, Ueda Reina is who defines all aspects of her personality. With Ueda Reina voicing her, the cracks in Akane's facade are on display while her villainous nature is brought to life at the pivotal moments. The sadness and insecurity that plagues her becomes more and more evident and eventually Akane completely breaks down in a spectacular manner. And Reina's sheer ability to rise to the occasion of portraying Akane at her lowest and shattering everyone's expectations is what's truly impressive about her performance. The jury felt that while other performances had more of an impact, Akane's performance was still worthy of a high place on this list.",

We specifically noted that out of the 3 female leads, it is Hanako who leads the comedy due to her role and the character's general need to be the centre of attention. Thus, it's only fitting that a talented VA such as Hina Kino would step up and fill the shoes of a character that's pretty difficult to play.\n\nAt times, Hanako would sound pompous, insincere, legitimately remorseful, cute, irritated, livid—almost everything on the emotional spectrum really. This could only have worked for someone who boasts a range capable of delivering a performance of this magnitude, and all of us agreed that Hina Kino's delivery was quite effective in providing us a memorable performance.\n\nSome of us even went as far as to say that Hina Kino's top notch delivery and impressive range was enough to carry the comedic value of *Asobi Asobase*. However, some amongst the jury simply did not feel that strongly. Hisone's no slouch when it comes to character interactions and since Misaki Kuno's delivery was also just as brilliant, Hina Kino found an equal in her. Ultimately, it was the nuance behind Kuno's performance that allowed us to view Hisone's interactions as more natural in comparison to Hanako's. At the end of the day, Hina Kino's performance is a well executed and unconventional approach to voice acting and very deserving of all the praise it gets.",

Tough decisions had to be made even before the final nominations were completed as a few personal choices were cut along the way to finalize the best of the best. This fight gave our jurors the opportunity to explore a unique collection of anime to discover the best of the year. Several seasoned composers returned this year with multiple entries such as Yoshiaki Fujisawa (of Land of the Lustrous) with the uplifting, coming of age tale A Place Further Than the Universe and the orchestral, theatrical battle royale Revue Starlight. New composers as well made names for themselves such as Swedish DJ Rasmus Faber’s summertime jam Harukana Receive and solo artist Mabanua’s heavy, hip-hop inspired Megalo Box. Ultimately though, veteran composer Kensuke Ushio (of Ping Pong the Animation and A Silent Voice fame) gloriously returned this year onto our list in the forms of the synthwave fever dream Devilman Crybaby and the lilting, atmospheric Liz and the Blue Bird.\n\nThroughout the jury’s decision process, focuses such as “usage” and “variety” emerged as key discussion points. We looked for examples of the OST being integrated well into the narrative and scenes, and when it enhanced the show instead of merely supporting it. When a soundtrack faded into the background or began to overuse key tracks, the show naturally began to fall towards the bottom of the list. Though there was minor disagreement, the winner was clear to most of our jurors from the start and the fight from 3rd to 8th place concluded in the following order.",

        "writeup": "Harukana Receive is one of the best summertime soundtracks. This beach volleyball-centric sports anime nails the show's ‘summer vibe’ extremely well. Merengue undertones are scattered throughout with a poppy and energetic flair to give it some extra oomph in laidback or hype moments throughout the show. The dramatic scenes usually have a more serious tone with a darker inflection on most of the cuts than the rest of the OST. There is a decent amount of variation throughout the OST though, and the aforementioned vibe definitely shines through among the rest of the cuts. Rise sets the tone of the show in the opening moments while being catchy and memorable on its own. Meanwhile, other tracks like Yummy Bunny, Dinosaur Dig and Five-One create the intensity required for every good sports anime. Crossing Space is a track that’s used very well in the climax of the matches. Almost every song on the soundtrack is extremely catchy and fits the matches well, with songs paired to specific characters. Harukana's OST would be perfect to play while driving around a beach town in summer and also when laying out at the beach or the poolside. Given the limits of the show, Faber did a fantastic job of creating an atmosphere that exudes the feeling of summer. While most of the jurors had good things to say about Harukana Receive's soundtrack, the other choices displayed more variety and better timing in their respective shows, enhancing the shows' narratives to a greater degree.",

        "writeup": "3-Gatsu no Lion offered an exemplary OST that had breadth, individual knockouts, and overall was very suited to its series. Many jurors remarked on the variety. The dramatic pieces drew nearly universal acclaim, while the lighter pieces drew more mixed responses. This variety enabled the OST to be an excellent companion to the show. Many jurors described it as ‘subtle,’ but I would up the ante with ‘surgical.’ Its composition was clearly tailored to fit the show’s very unique and varying moods, and it manages to do so in a way that doesn’t overpower the show it accompanies.\n\n\nThe OST offered standout individual performances. Hina’s outburst in episode 4 - the synchronization being perfect highlights how tailored the usage was. The scene in episode 16 where Akari confronts Takagi’s mother shows just how bleak the series can feel. But nearly all jurors agreed that the crown jewel was Burnt Field, a piece featuring Shakuhachi flute with double-bass and strumming electric guitar that encompasses the desolation and grit of an aged shogi master immaculately.\n\n\nWhat really elevated this OST was the manner of use – while many OSTs are used to create mood, representing rapidly changing mood is central to 3-Gatsu’s treatment of depression and anxiety which is central to the work. By using the OST to lead scenes, the series captures wonderfully the unease and whiplash that Rei sometimes feels.\n\n\nWhile there were criticisms of the OST, such as being poor standalone and having less than stellar light tracks, what really held 3-Gatsu back was more the quality of the entries above it. Both Liz to Aoi Tori and Starlight deftly interwove their OSTs into their narrative to create a work inseparable from the parent production, making it difficult to place 3-Gatsu above them.",

        "writeup": "Shoujo☆Kageki Revue Starlight’s OST can roughly be divided up into two parts, a more normal OST and an insert song OST. The more normal OST is solid but somewhat traditional. It accomplishes the goals of the show, providing an appropriate breadth of expression for the subject matter. It has songs for the slice-of-life-y portions of the everyday lives, songs that underscore the mystery behind the enigmatic giraffe, and songs that well capture the despair often experienced in the immediate vicinity of the revues. Probably the best part of the OST is a reproduction, the theme that accompanies the transformation sequence. Featuring a medley of instruments that progressively intensify before being joined by a whispered chorus, it provides an excellent transition between Starlight’s two disparate halves by providing a somewhat otherworldly sound to bridge the two.\n\n\nAs solid as the instrumental OST for Starlight is, though, what really sets it apart from its competitors, and the reason it easily takes position two is its phenomenal insert tracks. Composed of eleven songs that each feel bursting with identity and sung by the seiyuus in character, these tracks are the gold standard for integrating an OST – the grand ballads not only matched the bombastic tone of the kirin’s revues but also tied into its metanarrative by providing a platform for the girls to express their anxieties and goals that was paralleled by the spectacle of battle. For example, in Revue of Pride, the cinematography enforces Maya’s dominance which works in concert with an overpowering vocal performance to really emphasize the gap in skill between her and Karen. This deft incorporation of the music into the narrative puts it above basically all other entries this year, so it was a pretty easy second place.",

        "writeup": "An OST absolutely bursting with atmosphere, personality and emotion, Liz to Aoi Tori features every important characteristic of a good OST. The jury was particularly impressed by the sheer variety within the OST and the stellar usage of each track in context to the movie. Standalone, the composition might not be as impressive, but within context is where the OST truly shines. Kensuke Ushio, the composer, clearly designed this consistent and varied soundtrack with much consideration and dedication to the movie’s story, as the tracks evolve according to the mood that is being conveyed on-screen. Liz to Aoi Tori’s OST is crafted with much respect for the narrative as each track tells a story of its own while also providing the perfect backdrop for the movie’s events. Standout tracks like wind,glass,bluebird and doublereed,girls serve to create atmosphere and set the tone; Meanwhile, wind,glass,girls and reflexion,allegretto,you are packed with emotion designed to fit the scenes they are used in. Akito Matsuda’s dedication to the orchestral composition shines in the movie's emotional climax—The Third Movement, A Decision of Love, is so incredibly woven into the movie’s narrative and also serves as one of the most cathartic compositions of the year. Even though other OSTs this year opted for a similar approach to a narrative driving soundtrack, the Jury found that Liz to Aoi Tori outdid them all while simultaneously being the critical X-factor that the movie very much needed to elevate it to a timeless classic that skillfully paints a moving and turbulent tale of adolescence.",

Writing good day-to-day positive music is hard, but the show manages to capture it well with both a fairly strong musical identity and a fitting atmosphere. The music feels hard-working and motivated, which is what the show is about; working hard and doing something a little crazy to achieve your dreams.\n\n\nThe main criticisms that held it back came in two parts. First, the majority of tracks felt generally unnoteworthy, not really standing out as amazing or memorable. Second, the usage of insert tracks felt particularly lackluster. Towards the latter half of the show, the emotional climaxes started coming and the soundtrack took the route of piling on insert songs. They began to feel a little overplayed and are generally a cheap and easy way of creating emotion in the first place. The show would have benefited from more uniquely written music for each of these occasions instead of relying on inserts.",

Devilman’s OST is one that is bursting with identity, characterized by electronic music in a unique synthwave style, which seamlessly fits in with the trippy art style of the show. The soundtrack contains a fair few complete bangers like Judgement and D.V.M.N., which greatly complement some of the energetic action scenes, while some of the tracks feel almost soothing as you follow the carnage happening on-screen. The OST isn’t without depth though, with a couple more emotional tracks present during the heartbreaking finale, like From Here to Eternity. The jury also wants to acknowledge the excellent raps featured in the show, which functioned as a type of worldbuilding to bridge the gap between episodes, as well as adding a lot of character to the show. Some jurors, however, felt that while the OST worked great on its own, that it wasn’t used quite as well as the top three of the year, which is why it finds itself just narrowly outside of it.",

        "writeup": "Evan Call’s soundtrack brings viewers of Violet Evergarden on a journey of intense emotion. It begins by incorporating Violet’s measured, unsteady typewriter strokes against the longing strings and woodwinds of Theme of Violet Evergarden and A Doll’s Beginning, which mirror Violet’s desire to learn to communicate her feelings and understand those of the people who surround her. Violet quickly grows more confident in her abilities, which is never more boisterously represented than in Across the Violet Sky, which accompanies the imagery of Violet skirting over the surface of the lake, taking flight with her parasol in order to prove to an inconsolable writer that life can still go on, even after experiencing an immense tragedy. Unfortunately, Violet herself has some trauma to contend with, and the harshly bowed strings of Torment accompany that struggle through her inner demons, during her darkest hour near the end of episode 9. However, the ensuing compositions, The Love That Binds Us, and Aira Yuuki’s insert song Believe In…, lift Violet out of that depression, echoing her newfound understanding that no matter the destructive nature of her past, she can move forward by spreading love through the world and espousing kindness and courage instead of giving in to her fear of damnation. Some members of the jury felt that, despite how beautiful Violet’s soundtrack is on its own, at times, the usage of the music felt lackluster and disjointed. While tracks often faded into the background going mostly unnoticed, on occasion music seemed unnecessarily front-and-center in scenes that didn’t require such a focus. On the whole, this soundtrack remains exceptionally expressive and earns its placement among the best of the year.",

Tracks such as ‘MEGALOBOX’ and character themes like The theme of Yuri and The theme of Gansaku Nanbu become iconic in their usage as they play during their respective character-driven scenes, highlighting the importance of their actions. The raps all describe the tone and theme of the show, from the fast-paced ‘The Beast’ and ‘Gearless Joe’ to the mellow ‘Slum City’ giving sense to the emotions and feelings of Team Nowhere, in particular Sachio.\n\n\nMore direct action tracks such as ‘Get up’ and ‘Battlefield’ and those of inspiration and more obvious chill such as ‘Drive’ and ‘Slum’ respectively serve their purpose incredibly well in letting the audience know what direction the scene will take with either a simply hype or relaxed tone. Megalo’s OST might be obvious and straightforward, but the incredible quality of both tracks and usage allows it to go above and beyond most other anime, leaving behind a distinctly memorable and fun OST once you complete the show.",

Fans of the movie really enjoyed the symbolism of the movie looking like it was a sketch in the main character’s notebook, while some who had it lower would argue it was inconsistent in quality regardless of amateur-esque intent. Some other directorial decisions that seemed without purpose were given different weights as well. Virtually every juror agreed that these visual considerations were outweighed by the strength of the narrative enough to put it at least above a couple of shows, and combined with the high regard other jurors had for the music video, resulted in a spot towards the middle of the list.",

Befitting its family-friendly nature it uses a relatively simple base story to craft an incredibly enchanting and adorable experience.\n\n\nIt delivers an uplifting message of friendship, creativity and believing in yourself in a succinct and imaginative fashion, with an endearing cast of characters that you can’t help but root for. Baja no Studio effectively invokes the childhood wonder that gets lost so often in our daily lives and that’s not only impressive by itself, it does all of this in a very short amount of time.",

        "writeup": "Despite the controversial placements of music videos in the past, Baby I Love You Daze takes it one step further than the norm, with this short being in the form of a commercial. This commercial celebrates Lotte’s 70th anniversary that showcases its catalogue in a way that is vibrant and bombastic, to say the least. Amidst the chaos, the narrative is one that tells a simple yet heartwarming love story, seen through the eyes of our protagonist. A short at 3 minutes and 50 seconds, it comes as one of the most well-animated nominees out of the list, however, that is to be expected given its length and purpose. The use of the jump cuts was controversial, to say the least, but it does signify the influence of Lotte’s product in everyday life. Besides the jump cuts, other directive choices such as the presence of the subway billboards and a shot through the eyes of our protagonist make an ingenious representation towards the sea of events that occur in everyday life. Other aspects of visual production were well done. well-composed shots, appropriate lighting and a stylistic choice that reflects well upon the growth of both society and technology, this commercial is a treat to watch. The catchy tune by Bump of Chicken compliments the nature of the commercial nicely. At the end of the day, all aspects ranging from visual production to the music of Baby I Love You Daze come together to convey a simple yet charming short- one that is worthy to be the centrepiece of Lotte’s 70th-anniversary celebration.",

        "writeup": "Compared to its earlier counterpart, the Netflix version of Aggressive Retsuko is a milder, longer, and more slice-of-life oriented take on Retsuko’s struggles as a 25-year old single Japanese office lady. It is definitely less comical despite having the same relatable workplace humor since the rage set-ups are too drawn out. However, what it loses in comedy, it gains somewhat in cast characterization. Fenneko and Haida improve the most character-wise, but the other cast members don’t really get as much shine. While just as rightfully infuriating as the original, the show’s antagonists aren’t compelling enough because of a lack of depth and variety afforded to them.\n\n\nThe narrative is better explored compared to the original, mainly with regards to Retsuko’s love life and her struggles with Director Ton. However, these plot points don’t go anywhere significant and mostly end up used as a gag instead, and whether or not the gags were effective remained contentious amongst the jury. However, the general quality of art and animation improved when compared to the original, and the voice acting remains to be a positive for the franchise.\n\n\nThe Netflix Aggressive Retsuko is a faithful adaptation of the original that ventured on a different take and ended up with a different reception. While some characters got a better exploration of their personalities, most remained stale despite the increased airtime. It remains to be a decent addition to the franchise, but multiple issues made the show end up in last when compared to the rest.",

The show’s comedy uses contrast in style and mood through the death growl punchline incredibly well; add Retsuko’s relatability and you have a solid formula for generating laughter and catharsis. However, the tolerance people have for such a formulaic structure varies from person to person, thus serving as the main detriment to the show’s stock.\n\n\nCharacter-wise, Aggressive Retsuko doesn’t have the strongest cast available, but Retsuko is one of the best characters for the job. She doesn’t have great depth to her nor does she undergo any significant character development, but her daily struggles and how she reacts to these are incredibly relatable, universal, and human. Watching her getting frustrated is humorous, but beneath all of this, she also provides an excellent commentary on the oppressiveness of Japanese culture.\n\n\nAggressive Retsuko found an effective comedic formula and stuck with it; although it definitely wasn’t afraid to stray from the oft-trodden path on occasion. Although the cast mostly consisted of cliched characters, Retsuko was a bright spot among them and carried the show to greater heights. Accompanied by memorable character designs along with some decent voice acting performances, Aggretsuko captivated our hearts and growled out our sorrows, leaving the jury laughing and applauding in its wake.",

Furthering compelling mountain treks and realistic drama, the show was able to strike a strong balance between the pleasant slice of life, with the struggles of growing up and dealing with complicated emotions. Despite the more drama-filled nature of the 3rd season, the show is able to still showcase mountain climbing and the joys that come with it. And even with it’s limited time it does not rush through events nor does it try to compensate for the time lost. It keeps its natural pacing and lets the show land where the show lands. Despite the peaks that the show has to offer a point of contention is in the conflict of the season, while many enjoyed the conflict between Hinata and Aoi, or appreciated it for what it had to offer, there were some who didn’t care for it nearly as much and felt that it took up too much of the limited time that it had. And while that was enough to put it behind the top two entries, it was agreed that Yama no Susume season 3 was a great entry to the series, and a great short that managed to do a lot with its limited time.",

While the show was generally enjoyable, it mostly garnered neutral reactions rather than love or hate, with some highlights that were better and more likable as well. In particular, Saitou Souma’s voice performance as the eponymous Honda-san was excellent. He gave us a suitably awkward, slightly neurotic portrayal of the main character, and it worked great for the show’s relaxed style of humor. This was especially important because there was so little visual comedy involved, largely due to the rather spartan approach to animation and character design. It was unique in this aspect, with everyone wearing masks all the time and very little movement animated, which had both positive and negative consequences. The show was sort of mildly funny but not crack-you-up hilarious. While the included knowledge about how both the publishing and book-retail worlds operate was interesting and generally appreciated, especially how it was integrated naturally and without feeling like a lecture, this was also something that not everyone would be able to relate to, and some of what could have been humor would be lost or ineffective as a result.

Taking the series in more of a slice of life direction, Emiya is intended more as fanservice for those that already are invested in the Fate series than as a standalone show, and it accomplishes this goal incredibly well. The show shines in terms of its visuals and cast, taking full advantage of the wealth of characters that the Fate series has to offer, allowing every episode to focus on someone new. However, this simple structure is what ultimately brought Emiya down a bit, as we felt that the show didn’t take full advantage of its characters (with the episode featuring Caster being a notable exception), they were just kind of there for fanservice purposes.

The movies this year had quite some variety on show from heartfelt dramas such as Maquia, I Want to Eat Your Pancreas and Liz to Aoi Tori to more comedic movies like Chuunibyou: Take on Me, Gochiusa: Dear my Sister and Girls Und Panzer: Das Finale and even more action oriented movies in Fate/Stay Night: Heavens Feels Part 1 and No Game No Life 0. Despite this variety there were very few original movies, with 6 out of the 8 movies on offer coming from already established series. The Jury didn’t have too much problem in sorting out the top 2 movies from the rest, even if there was some debate as to which was better out of the two. Places 3-8 were hotly contested, with many differing opinions as to where each show placed in relation to each other.

The characters still have their trademark traits (Chino being shy, Cocoa’s bubbliness, Rize’s easy embarrassment, etc) and the interactions that come from them continue to be great, making for some easy-going Slice of Life charm. Unfortunately, with its greatest strength being that it was able to capture what the TV show had produced, its biggest criticism was that that is all it did. The Jury felt that the lack of ambition of the movie compared to the others on offer this year held it back from placing higher. This contentedness to be just more Gochiusa and nothing else particularly stood out as its direct predecessor Gochiusa S2 had some character development that added another point of enjoyment and endearment to the show that Dear My Sister was unfortunately missing.\n\n\nDespite this, the initial enjoyment of the show and its success in giving us more Gochiusa to enjoy was enough to place it as the 6th best Movie of the Year.",

The typical wild goofiness of the series is continued in this movie as the ridiculousness of Shensa-do fighting as well as the antics and situations the girls get up to before the match creates some truly funny moments. The Jury did feel that this continuation of goofiness was well done but also did pale in comparison to some of the truly absurd but hilarious moments of the earlier projects in the series, particularly Der Film.\n\n\nOne of the strong points of the show was the introduction of the new cast members in the pirate crew. Their unique personalities made for a fresh addition to the cast as the new dynamic they brought to the Shensa-do club made for some hilarious moments. Notably, the scene of the challenge between the main 5 and the new cast was noted by Jury as being the biggest highlight of the film. The interactions between them as they sized each other up, as well as the general absurdity of an underground bar run high school pirates being infiltrated by high school girls, made it stand out within the movie.\n\n\nDespite the problems the Jury had in the movie not turning the dial to 11 enough, the times it did do that as well as the new additions to the cast made for a really enjoyable movie that will have you laughing to no end, thus earning it 4th Best Movie of 2018.",

The only part the jury collectively agreed upon was that the bedroom assault scene felt out of character and out of place. It came without warning, had no consequences on the narrative or characters and was discarded just as quickly.

It shows up at just enough key moments that it's presence is always felt, but never overstaying it's welcome. Of course, the movie also contains the great animation and fight choreography that you have come to expect from the Fate series, all backed by a great OST. The main complaints with the film come from the pacing of the plot itself, speeding through some parts (as it's the beginning of a new route, which means there is plenty of repetition), and dragging a bit at times as well in the middle of the movie. Speeding through parts of the story allowed things such as the mapo tofu scene to get the time and recognition it deserved, but ultimately kept the movie out of our top spots.",

However, the characters end up coming across as flat and underdeveloped, and the plot is sped along and full of exposition dumps. Ultimately, the jury decided that despite the film setting out to do something that separates itself from the show it’s based on, it misses out on a lot of the elements that made the sourcework what it was, and when so many of the other films here are spinoffs or sequels of established series, falling so short in capturing the spirit of the source as well as being underwhelming in the original elements is what landed this film in the last spot.",

The constant time skips lead to some important developments between Maquia and her son and their relationship but it also resulted in some pacing issues in terms of the political side story which the jury collectively felt like was the main weakness of the film. The characters involved in these side plots never got enough screen time to develop and the movie didn’t really end these arcs in a satisfying way. The movie brought it back with the ending which played on the themes it had to spend time meticulously setting up. In terms of visuals, Maquia didn’t disappoint putting on a visual spectacle with some stellar background artwork that helped breathe life to the fantasy setting and some great animation. With a strong beginning and ending the jury felt like Maquia was one of the stronger films of the year and our ranking in the top 3 reflects that.",

        "writeup": "Planet With was a fairly well-executed but standard-fare shonen. Planet With has a great message and fantastic cinematography when it comes to fight scenes. First off, the main cast is great at playing off each other, which is always necessary when you start to build a solid ensemble. Each of them has unique and complicated backgrounds that help build up who they are today. It is in this kind of world-building that Planet With manages to keep the characters always moving forward. Each of them has a clear goal that has personal weight to them. It leveraged a two-part structure to explore different approaches to violence and oppression as well. Also to note, being an action show the fights are incredibly important and highly entertaining. Here’s yet another show that handles CG well, giving us dynamically choreographed bouts with some nice 2D animation added in here and there. It’s very good looking with some nice models. Hell, the worst cut of CG in the show is in its OP, and it’s usually the other way around! At the end of the day, Planet With is a highly original action mecha series that a lot of people missed out on because of its weirdness and obtuse beginning.\n\n\nYet oftentimes the show felt restricted by the one cour and the story meandered at times which did not help itself. The CGI is decent, but a little overwhelming at times. The hype factor helps it through most of the show, but sometimes the fight scenes are weird simply because of how strange some of the designs are. Together with the fact, the plot resolves itself a little too perfectly and peacefully it prevents Planet With from being more than a truly enjoyable ride.",

        "writeup": "Hisone to Maso-tan was elected as the best original show of the year. And rightfully so. The show was a masterpiece of the year and incredibly fresh to watch. Vibrant, expressive characters are developed through the use of its core simple designs. Each episode is enjoyable to watch because of the well- developed animation and talent. This is due to the implementation of traditional animation techniques. Hisone as a character is amazing because she has such a fun personality. She’s witty and self-deprecating but at the same time relatable in both social and personal thought. She’s awkward around people because she wasn't that popular but at the same time not annoyingly kept in that corner like other characters such as the main character in Pancreas or Hiro from Darlifra. Not to mention that the supporting cast is spectacular. The humans are all funny and enjoyable. Nao is a nice comedic and dramatic foil to Hisone since she also faces the same emotional upheaval about her career and life choices regarding her mother and family. But at the same time, Nao comes to terms with it. Ririko is a great comedic element in how unorthodox she is and her aloof attitude. Mayumi is a nice character who shows us another dimension of emotional range and how she seems to undervalue herself. Eru is hot and she also allows the sexism themes in the show to come full circle as she rejects the theme that women have to be just as cutthroat as men. She was simply taking traditional male attitudes about the workplace instead of being her own self. This brings us to the dragons who are all differing in personalities and yet complement their human counterparts. They are all uniquely designed and fun to watch, especially in shots where they are in the open air. While the plot does seem to go into a spiral of confusion, it quickly rallies back in the last few episodes when the God Fish arrives and you enjoy a great emotional tugging conclusion about how the workplace is not worth sacrificing your life rather you should not tie your identity to your work but your career is a part of your identity.",

        "writeup": "Starlight was an interesting case in which the jury more or less was in unanimous agreement about the strengths and weaknesses of the show. While the presentation was nearly unanimously regarded as excellent and the thematic aspects were praised, the characters and narrative fell short in the eyes of the jury.\n\n\nThe most standout aspect of Starlight was definitely its production – it boasts masterful cinematography and quality animation. The revues, in particular, were definitely some of the more well-produced and well-directed sequences of the year. The over-the-top spectacle of the Kirin’s stage of destiny provided a spectacle that had something for everyone. However, the crown jewel of the series has to be its original soundtrack. The normal OST was solid, providing a reasonable breadth of expression, having a good mix of mysterious, slice-of-life, and hype tracks, but the real power of the OST lies in the insert tracks and how they tie into the theming, both of the series and of individual episodes. Thematically, Starlight was no slouch either. Many jurors deeply resonated with the message they took from the show, be it about the nature of competition or the ruthlessness of theatre.\n\n\nAt the end of the day, though, the actual story being told was fairly weak. Many jurors found the midseason arc to be the most compelling narrative and some even found it to actively upstage the later arcs. The characters were also not well-regarded. Outside of Nana, who was widely praised, many characters felt very trope-y, which aided in the thematic message but did so at the cost of their fullness and role in the literal narrative.",

        "writeup": "Probably the strongest aspect of Megalo Box was the array of themes interwoven into its narrative. It blends the classic sports narrative of an underdog story with elements of science fiction dystopia via man-vs-machine. By shining a light on the privilege offered not only by gears but by citizenship, the narrative makes it clear that Joe is not only an underdog in the ring, allowing the two interleaving narratives to produce a third narrative of poverty in a post-futurist world. The theme that receives the most direct treatment is probably the man-vs-machine theme clearly enveloped by the protagonist’s ring name. Time and time again, he triumphs against increasingly heavily armed opponents that each feel like a mini-commentary on this overarching theme. The series finale answers the man-vs-machine question emphatically by stressing that, even though Yuri with his gear would have easily beaten Joe, his very human desires prevailed in the end.\n\n\nAdditional praise can be given to Megalo Box for creating a coherent tone and setting. The retro-inspired backdrops, the grungy yet upbeat OST, and even the downscaled art style all came together to create a world of disparity that felt surprisingly whole despite little explicit attention.\n\nDespite all of its advantages, there were some issues with the series. The pacing was a bit off- Megalo Box felt like a victim of the 12-episode standard. Additionally, the fights themselves, ostensibly the centerpiece of the anime, were lacking in spectacle – they offered pretty lackluster animation and choreography. At the end of the day, the fights served the theming very well, and arguably didn’t even matter, but this black mark was still enough for it to be considered beneath the top three.",

Akane is definitely the aspect of the show that stands out above the somewhat underwhelming remaining cast, as her outgoing but cynical attitude makes for some rather interesting developments given her true nature. Episode 9, in particular, has fantastic direction and conveys the headspace of Akane incredibly well, and the finale, while divisive, certainly helps drive home that central theme. Unfortunately, much of the middling portion of the show does tend to flounder a bit, as the show takes some time getting to the main plot and its side characters do not do much in support of the story or main cast. In spite of its flaws though, the show boasts some solid action scenes, interesting kaijuu designs, and a great antagonist, making it one of the better original shows of the year.",

        "writeup": "With one of the best opening sequences of 2018, Zombieland Saga is a series that knew its strengths right from the beginning and played to its abilities throughout the Fall 2018 season. In comparison to its competitors in this category, there are obvious reasons that prevent its successes but its highlights are as follows. Firstly, whilst visual production was far from brilliant, Zombieland Saga did excel when character design was considered. its characters are vibrant and visually stimulating. As series within the idol genre, the designs of the characters, especially in their outfits are designed to do its job, which is to stand out. Each Franchouchou member is able to stand out on her own just based on her hairstyle which is a big plus as far as character design is concerned. Being episodic in nature, the series does a relatively good job of exploring each member of the band, with some highlights episodes for certain characters. The background exploration of each of the members of Franchouchou does add a layer of complexity to each of its characters. However, key issues that plague this series include stunted character development, the hit or miss comedic attempts and the use of CGI to name a few. Whilst Zombieland Saga is far from the best, it does have its highlights and positives. The niche that drives Zombieland Saga is a refreshing take but more needs to be done as far as fundamentals are concerned. In a category that is highly competitive in nature, simply being “good” or “special” is not enough. However, as far as it is concerned, it was one of the ‘best’ originals of 2018.",

        "writeup": "Sora Yori was a well-liked anime within the jury, but everyone had at least a few complaints to go along with their praise. One of the most unanimously lauded aspects was the characters and their interactions. Not only were they likable with enjoyable chemistry to witness, but they also received compelling and satisfying arcs. Shirase, in particular, was praised highly, with her arc near the end being considered one of the highlights of the show. The themes expressed by the show, such as finding yourself in a dizzying modern world, also resonated with the jurors. The much-lauded “running scene” is one of the most effective examples in this regard, being a great expression of youthful bliss that goes against the guidance of authority figures. All the praise aside, a few things kept Sora Yori from being competitive with HisoMaso. One recurring complaint was that many found the portrayal of Antarctica itself to be disappointing due to it not living up to the hype of being a very dangerous environment. Judges also saw the show as overly formulaic in the way it presented arcs and emotional peaks.",

        "writeup": "The original Cardcaptor Sakura is a show that dates all the way back to the 90’s, and while it was a bit divisive overall, the jury ultimately felt as though Clear Card lived up to the expectations that were laid before it. The great cast that made the original what it was is still all here, with Tomoyo getting some new technology to record Sakura with, Touya and Fujikata coming together for some great family moments, Kero still being the fun mascot character that he is (along with the re-addition of Leave it to Kero-chan!), Syaoran and Sakura having some cute relationship moments after what happened in the Sealed Card movie, and many other side characters that would take too many words to fully list, but are still memorable and leave an impact on the show. The episodic battles with each of the cards were also still a lot of fun to watch, with Sakura getting a lot more varied powers to work with, that she used in creative ways. However, the main complaint from jurors in this category is that while all these things were still there, they weren't expanded upon enough too much. The show is much more SoL-focused (which is something that some people preferred) rather than developing the main plot, and it ultimately leaves the season ending on a cliffhanger, along with not as much development for the cast as was hoped for. The jury still felt that it executed enough right to overcome these complaints though, landing it in a solid spot in our overall rankings.",

Many of the jurors were impressed with the portrayal of Kondou, which is all the more telling for a middle-aged restaurant manager, and his interactions with Akira made for one of the most realistic and genuine personal relationships of the year. On top of this KoiAme has absolutely an absolutely stellar production, from its artstyle and solid OST to its amazing cinematography.\n\n\nThe only real downside to the show could be found in its sometimes faltering supporting cast, especially the character of Ryousuke Kase who thankfully didn't appear much beyond a single episode. It didn't do much to mar the jury's opinion of KoiAme, especially as its focus is very much on the leads, who are also its greatest strength.

Her initial desire to keep the status quo and subsequent clash of ideologies with Karen lead to a pretty satisfying and compelling character arc. To top this all off, Starlight has an extremely impressive and well rounded production, with its phenomenal OST and inventive cinematography coming together combining to tell a story with each and every Revue. Starlight is a show with a message which resonated with many of us personally and its position in our rankings reflects our stance that it’s up there with the best of 2018.",

The writers at KyoAni had to rework large amounts of its source material in order to adapt it to the anime format, resulting in a somewhat episodic, somewhat linear story about an unemotional girl looking for the meaning of “I love you.” The visuals often feature often excellent animation and art, its soundtrack is as we’ve come to expect from KyoAni, and there’s certainly enough potential in that premise to create a classic.\n\n\nThe quality of the anime certainly had high and low points, and the jury’sour reactions to it were thoroughly mixed as a result. The jury largely felt that Violet’s character and relationship to Gilbert were mishandled, preferring several of the episodic stories within the anime over its central narrative, and there was also considerable critique toward the amount of processing that was applied to the visuals. On the other hand, the world it is set in seemed interesting from what we saw of it, some of the episodes were genuinely emotional and powerful, and the amount of work that went into the production did not go unappreciated.",

        "writeup": "Production, narrative, characters – 3-Gatsu no Lion season 2 has all the makings of a timeless classic, so it is no surprise to many that it finds itself as the 2018 Anime of the Year. Despite some issues with the very divisive bullying arc, the anime boasted such strengths that it unsurprisingly won.\n\n\nIn its second season, 3-Gatsu no Lion remains a very compelling character drama that explores themes of competition and adolescent depression in a way that synthesizes a variety of arcs to create a compelling and coherent whole. In particular, the shogi-adjacent arcs drew unanimous praise among the jury. The Newcomer King arc explored Rei’s resolve and showcased his growth, and the epilogue featuring Junkei explored some poignant themes of competition. The Souya arc displayed Rei’s potential while elaborating on themes of the intersection of disability and competition established via Rei’s depression and Nikaido’s illness. However, the crown jewel of this season was the Burnt Field arc. A harrowing tale of resolve, complete with arguably the best visual metaphors in a series that adores its visual metaphors and backed by one of the most haunting individual soundtracks of the year, the Burning Field was considered by many to be the high point of the year.\n\n\nThe production of 3-Gatsu follows cues from its incredible first season. The artstyle and background drew mixed praise, but the animation, cinematography, sound design, and OST all are standout alone. The series is a fantastic example of a whole being more than the sum of its parts, with very strong individual elements coming together to create a truly exceptional production. For example, the use of the OST to lead stark artstyle shifts showcases the emotional whiplash Rei feels in his depressive swings that are a hallmark of the series.\n\n\nOf course, any discussion of this season would be incomplete without mention of the contentious bully arc would be incomplete. Jurors praised the arc as an examination of various responses to the issue of bullying and the character of Hinata, but found the pacing to be poor and the side characters to be beneath the standard set for the series. While these characters were far from awful, and these high standards are perhaps the most compelling example of how highly regarded the show was.",

        "writeup": "Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai is an important exercise in exploring modern-day issues of the age of information, which has been fairly absent from anime as a medium until now. The show manages to provide an enjoyable and comedic experience with its main couple while still nailing every episode kept grounded to the subject matter it needed to handle. Even after the show managed to hook viewers with its promotional material that ended up largely absent from the anime, it kept them watching with its entertaining story and its competent look at supernatural exaggerations of relevant issues adolescents face today. Being one of Cloverworks’ first adaptations as a studio, the popularity of the show is definitely impressive.\n\n\nAoButa was one of the most popular shows of 2018 and was subjected thusly to criticism and scrutiny by the jury. The show had very divisive elements, and among the jurors there was dissent for pretty much every aspect of the show, causing it to be regarded lowly over all. The most prevalent complaint seemed to be the ham-fisted quantum physics terms used to ground the show in reality. Nonetheless, Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai definitely did enough right to stand among the other nominees for Anime of the Year and to earn its nomination.",

        "writeup": "Sora Yori goes about creating its coming of age narrative through the scope of a wonderfully relatable cast of characters backed by an inspirational adventure story. The jury’s praise for Sora Yori lies within the execution of Shirase’s arc of finding closure regarding her mother as well as the overall message of taking control of one’s life that is present throughout the show. Backed by stellar production values and competent direction, Sora Yori is able to bring both its emotional moments and its more laid-back comedic moments to life in a great way. On the other hand, the jury felt as though Sora Yori became a bit formulaic towards its midpoint, following a predetermined setup and execution of its emotional moments for each episode. In addition to this, some jurors had issues with a number of characters in the show, ranging from Hinata being used as a writer’s tool, to Shirase’s dramatic character arc clashing with her comedic moments, to the way that Mari’s friend’s arc was resolved. That being said, Sora Yori was absolutely a standout this year and well earns its place here.",
