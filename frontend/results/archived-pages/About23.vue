                                        <p>The /r/anime Awards, this website, and the Awards Livestream are a labor of love made possible through the many volunteers involved in the entire process.</p>
                                        <br/>
                                        <p>We'd like to start by thanking /u/chonpalm, /u/eritbh, /u/FrenziedHero, /u/hauntmeagain, /u/JoseiToAoiTori, /u/Kei74, and /u/PandavengerX for their work in creating this website and for putting up with unending changes, edits, and last-minute requests. We would also like to thank them for their work on the websites for juror applications, initial voting, final voting, and the internal website used by hosts and /r/anime moderators to manage the Awards.</p>
                                        <br/>
                                        <p>We'd like to thank all of our livestream guests for agreeing to be a part of this year's most ambitious endeavor. You all have plenty of your own work, but you were willing to help in making our results discussion more varied and insightful. We hope it was a pleasant rather than taxing experience!</p>
                                        <br/>
                                        <p>We'd like to thank /u/DrJWilson, /u/MyrnaMountWeazel, and /u/paukshop specifically for being willing to take up the monumental task of livestream hosts, along with all of the coordinating, behind-the-scenes work, and stamina that this role involves. The fact that Wilson is also rumored to be the WORLD FAMOUS YOUTUBER KAMIMASHITA is just icing on the cake.</p>
                                        <br/>
                                        <p>We'd like to thank all of the people who put work into the production of the livestream: /u/Animestuck, /u/ArcaneGarbageman, /u/Aztei, /u/Kay, /u/Koala, and /u/paukshop.</p>
                                        <br/>
                                        <p>We'd like to thank all the people who volunteered to proofread jury write-ups: /u/Animestuck, /u/Arcanegarbageman, /u/Boi409, /u/DoctorWhoops, /u/Duckloader, /u/Koala, /u/MetaSoshi9, /u/Mikio, /u/MyrnaMountWeazel, /u/RootaBagel, /u/Schinco, and /u/tehoncomingstorm97.</p>
                                        <br/>
                                        <p>We're thankful to the moderators of r/anime for their support and in many cases active cooperation with something as involved as the awards: /u/AmusedDragon, /u/badspler, /u/Dagonsnake, /u/DrJWilson, /u/FAN_ROTOM_IS_SCARY, /u/Gaporigo, /u/Mage_of_Shadows, /u/mpp00, /u/MyrnaMountWeazel, /u/mysterybiscuitsoyeah and /u/Thrasher439.</p>
                                        <br/>
                                        <p>We're also profoundly grateful to the users who undertook the considerable task of hosting this year: /u/Duckloader, /u/Kenalskii, /u/MetaSoshi9, /u/RuSyxx, /u/Schinco and /u/Vaxivop.</p>
                                        <br/>
                                        <p>The true soul of the r/Anime Awards is the evaluation of each year's anime, and from the jury side of things it is not an easy task. We want to thank all of the over 60 jurors who signed up to watch, discuss, and write about the enormous number of selections available this year. It was a blast to work with all of them and we hope to see some familiar faces apply again next year!</p>
                                        <br/>
                                        <p>Finally, we would also like to thank you, the public! Without your support, these awards would not be able to come to fruition, and you are both the participants and the audience for whom these awards are run. We hope you join us on this journey again next year!</p>
