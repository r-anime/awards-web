		<h2 class="title is-3 has-text-white"> How Do We Judge? </h2>
		<p class="has-text-white pb-20">		
			Each category consists of up to 25 jury members who collaborate on Discord during the Awards season. Their role is to narrow the year's options to five jury nominations, rank them alongside five nominations from the public, and write reviews. The jury’s rankings and reviews are posted alongside the public rankings determined by the subreddit’s popular vote.

		<h1 class="title is-2 has-text-gold has-text-centered pb-20">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
		<h2 class="title is-3 has-text-white">Why is Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu 3rd Season not eligible this year?</h2>
			<p class="has-text-white pb-20">
				This ReZero season airs over 2 consecutive seasons with an unorthodox break in-between. As per database guidelines and extensive consultation with databases like Anilist and MyAnimeList any planned break of less than 3 months (i.e. a cour) deems it a single continuous season as opposed to a split cour. Therefore, the season will be eligible after its completion as a full entry in our 2025 awards.
			</p>
		<br>
		<h2 class="title is-3 has-text-white">Are movies eligible for nomination in the Production Categories like Best Animation and Best Soundtrack?</h2>
			<p class="has-text-white pb-20">
				No, only TV anime, short series, and ONAs/OVAs with multiple episodes are eligible for nomination in Production Categories. Movies, single episode ONAs/OVAs, music videos, and other single-episode shorts are ineligible but can receive Honorable Mentions from the jury.
			</p>
		<h2 class="title is-3 has-text-white">Why can’t I nominate One Piece/Blue Box/Trillion Game/Amagami-san Chi no Enmusubi/Rurouni Kenshin (2023) Season 2 in any Category besides OP/ED?</h2>
			<p class="has-text-white pb-20">
				Anime that don’t finish in 2024 such a 2-cour Fall Shows or long-running shows with continuous release schedules are not eligible for any category besides OP/ED. These shows will be eligible the year they reach completion.
			</p>
		<h2 class="title is-3 has-text-white">Why can’t I nominate Look Back/Kimi no Iro/Mononoke Karakasa/Bocchi the Rock: Re in any category?</h2>
			<p class="has-text-white pb-20">
				Movies that don’t have an English subbed Blu-Ray or Official Streaming Release are not eligible for nomination. They will be carried over to the next year until a Blu-Ray or Official Streaming Release becomes available. Camrips are not allowed. Recap, Compilation, or Extended Edition Movies are not eligible unless they have at least 40 mins of new footage added beyond the original material.
			</p>
		<h2 class="title is-3 has-text-white">If a previously-unsubbed OVA from the '80s got its fansub or official subbed release this year, would that become eligible?</h2>
			<p class="has-text-white pb-20">
				No, the r/anime awards only tracks anime releases between 2016 and present day. If an anime released between these years fails to meet the criteria for eligibility (fully English subtitled, Blu-Ray or Official Streaming Release online) then its eligibility is transferred to the first year it satisfies all requirements.
			</p>
		<h2 class="title is-3 has-text-white">Are anime with multiple genres eligible for multiple Genre Categories?</h2>
			<p class="has-text-white pb-20">
				Each eligible anime is assigned a primary genre designation by the hosts on the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRT0cwrsCdTj9uyy1Getosi2fueW5mGUzFzz3FhGtrOqMCGgP8Ghz1VjMmhoNcl0LCxc0DqbK7qWaLD/pubhtml#" target="_blank">Genre Allocation Sheet</a>. Shows can be shortlisted by jurors for genre categories outside of this designation with host discretion, however an anime can only be nominated in one genre category, with priority given to its primary genre designation. Primary genre allocation may be appealed through <a href="/feedback">a form available on the Awards website</a>.
			</p>
		<h2 class="title is-3 has-text-white">How are Genre Categories like Best Action judged? Do they award the shows with the Best Action scenes?</h2>
			<p class="has-text-white pb-20">
				Genre Categories assess their nominations holistically, focusing on overall quality in writing and production, rather than how well they adhere to genre norms. In other words, Action nominations, for example,  are judged as “Best Anime in the Action Category”, rather than “Best Anime at Action”. This same principle applies to all genre categories.
			</p>
		<h2 class="title is-3 has-text-white">How come an anime was nominated in Anime of the Year but not any of its genres? And how come an anime can be ranked highly in one category but low in another?</h2>
			<p class="has-text-white pb-20">
				Each category is comprised of a unique group of jurors and receives a different collection of nominations from both jurors and the public. As a result, the outcomes of each category are independent and separate from those of other categories.
			</p>
		<h2 class="title is-3 has-text-white">Are some categories filled with the same types of jurors that all like a specific show?</h2>
			<p class="has-text-white pb-20">
				Initial category allocations are determined based on anonymized jury application responses, while subsequent allocations during the Awards are based on activity and the quality of discussions, independent of personal anime preferences. This ensures that jurors are assigned categories fairly, without bias related to their individual tastes in anime.
			</p>
		<h2 class="title is-3 has-text-white">I disagree with the placement of some anime in their respective genres. What do I do?</h2>
			<p class="has-text-white pb-20">
				The Hosts allocate the primary genre of each anime to the best of their abilities. If you have concerns or disagreements over the resulting placement, please submit your feedback through our <a href="/feedback">feedback form</a>.
			</p>
		<h2 class="title is-3 has-text-white">Why is anime that’s not eligible for the Crunchyroll Awards eligible in the /r/anime Awards and vice versa?</h2>
			<p class="has-text-white pb-20">
				The Crunchyroll Awards and the /r/anime Awards are separate and have their own distinct eligibility criteria. For more information on our criteria, you can refer to the Jury Guide.
			</p>
		<h2 class="title is-3 has-text-white">How come I can’t vote?</h2>
			<p class="has-text-white pb-20">
				In order to vote in the Awards your Reddit account needs to be at least 1 month old. If you are still experiencing issues please do not hesitate to post in any of the Awards threads or contact the Awards through our <a href="/feedback">feedback form</a>.
			</p>
		<h2 class="title is-3 has-text-white">Last year the rules were different, what’s going on?</h2>
			<p class="has-text-white pb-20">
				As a community-driven project, the Awards are reviewed and updated annually, with new Hosts introducing fresh ideas to enhance the experience for all participants. The most current procedures and guidelines can be found in the detailed Jury Guide.
