						Thank you for selecting me to win the award for animation(?)
						<br/>
                        This animation took me two and a half years to complete by myself. The techniques are mainly 2D Digital and stop-motion animation. Being the first animated short film, I encountered a lot of challenges. But I was able to finish it in the end.
						<br/>
						I'm very thankful to Sato Nanami, who helped me with the soundtrack, because her music made the mood of the work stronger.
						<br/>
						I'm also grateful to my teachers and friends who helped me when I was in trouble.
						<br/>
						Lastly, I'd like to thank you all again for liking it!

						This is Yukimura, the writer and artist of the Vinland Saga manga, which the anime is based on. In receiving this award, I'm once again feeling how much power the field of contemporary anime holds, and how strong it is in its ability to reach people and spread across the world. With just my manga alone, I doubt I would have been able to make as many people aware of Vinland Saga as there are today. Amidst all the anime that came out this year, thank you so much for paying attention to our work. This award is only possible thanks to the honest work of Director Yabuta and all the staff who worked on the show. I am so happy that the fruits of their serious work has been properly valued. Thank you. And to Director Yabuta, and everyone on the anime staff, congratulations!!

						To /r/anime, and the entire community that has supported us. I am truly thankful to have received this brilliant award. Vinland Saga is a work that shows Yukimura-sensei's frank outlook as he confronts the theme of violence. Even in the current day, over 1000 years on from the era depicted in the series, we believe that the strong messaging in the series is thought-provoking, and that is precisely why it has resonated with so many people. We cannot contain our joy at how far it has reached. This is all thanks to nothing other than the understanding and passion showed by the community that has emerged from all of you. It is an honor to have been able to provide some small help to Yukimura-sensei in bringing his story to so many people.

						It seems like reddit is an app that only English-speakers use in Japan, so I had never heard of it.<br/>
						<br/>
						The fact that, out there in the world, people are watching this anime called Heavenly Delusion, and paying attention and remembering the background art, makes me as a member of the staff extremely happy and thankful.<br/>
						<br/>
						Background art is not something that can be done alone. Right until the end, I was joined by the art team; director Mori-san; photography director Waki-san; Hirose-san, who did the color design; and all the animators who drew the fantastic layouts. The production assistants were also very patient waiting for me. I feel that what we managed to create is the product of all our talents put together.<br/>

						I myself am a fan of the original work by Ishiguro-sensei. I worked as hard as I could to make something that my fellow fans of the original would be happy to see.
