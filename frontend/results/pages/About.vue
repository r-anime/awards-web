                                   The true soul of the r/Anime Awards is the evaluation of each year’s anime, and from the jury side of things it is not an easy task. We want to thank all of the 90+ jurors who signed up to watch, discuss, and write about the enormous number of selections available this year. It was a blast to work with all of them and we hope to see some familiar faces apply again next year!
