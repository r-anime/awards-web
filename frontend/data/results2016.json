Even though both the main characters are ultra-shy and inexperienced, they still push themselves to progress their relationship, even if it's in tiny ways. Yuki's incessant stalking of Momo comes off as cute and funny rather than creepy and off-putting. Our main complaint is that the series meanders a bit too much in the middle and major progression between the main characters stalls until the final episodes.",

Kakeru is, understandably, not focused on romance because he has other demons to deal with first. When the romance between a side pairing is infinitely more fun to watch, your main pairing has a lot of work to do.

          "writeup": "Yuri on Ice provided some of the most impactful romantic moments of the year. The passion and electricity between Yuri and Viktor was palpable and kept us all on the edge of our seats from episode to episode. Whether they were running to each other in the airport, or swiftly skating to rinkside for a hug, the almost desperate desire to be close to one another made Yuri and Viktor's romance very intriguing to follow. Unfortunately, it seemed that the show was always holding something back, for all the scenes it did give us. From the \"kiss\" scene to the \"engagement\" ring they almost playfully avoid making anything explicit to the extent that someone could make an argument that their relationship isn't one of romantic love, but rather based only on admiration and friendship. It is difficult to pinpoint if Yuri even truly understands the difference between romantic love and admiration or gratitude. The show further avoids romantic interactions by focusing heavily on skating in its second half, which left a ton of loose threads to be resolved in a final episode, which still never made clear what feelings Yuri had for Viktor as a lover, as a coach, as a competitor, or as a friend. We hope the show wholeheartedly embraces its subtext in future seasons.",

Luckily it breaks with shoujo tradition because the protagonist, Shirayuki, is a godsend for shoujo female leads, easily one of the best we've seen. She is a strong, capable, and independent woman who has the determination and kind charisma to succeed without the help of the princely suitors in her life. Throughout the second season Prince Zen and Shirayuki are separated for long periods of time, but Shirayuki takes these opportunities to earn the respect of everyone around her and change her kingdom for the better. All the while, Zen and Shirayuki's love for each other only grows deeper, even from a great distance, as they overcome all obstacles to return to each others' side. When the two finally do reunite, they are on more equal footing, and the romance between them is justified in both the eyes of the kingdom and the viewer. Even while they are apart, the romantic side stories between other cast members will do plenty to keep romance fans grinning from ear to ear.",

Watching Arata and An ship together their younger friends, Rena and Oga, urging them to push through their teenage angst and accept that they just needed to hook up already, was really enjoyable. Sadly this show struggles in a classic romance sense, because it is an incomplete adaptation. One could potentially choose to view the show as a Romeo & Juliet-style tragic romance where the two mains grow fonder of each other, but whose relationship is star-crossed and seems like it will never resolve itself. In any case, the main pairing sees little progression in this first season, so we are left to wonder at what might be.",

The show did a great job living up to illustrious titles like Godfather, Scarface, and Goodfellas. The creators used every trick from those classic mafia thrillers, and they use them well. Inventive cinematography combined with a rich genre history of symbolism make for a compelling watch.

A deeply unsatisfying ending only cemented this show's place.",

Sure, he gets mixed up with a serial killer along the way, but he takes a backseat in that. While Jotaro and Rohan are hunting a murderer, Josuke is going to school and coming up with clever money making schemes. The issue is, he's not the best character in his own show; he's arguably not even the most important character in his own show. One could make a strong case that the only reason Josuke is even considered the main character is that Koichi has a little less screen time and his name isn't in the title. Josuke also doesn't really have a character arc or any character development to speak of. Unlike Koichi or Rohan, he's a static character who acts exactly the same at the beginning of the Part as at the end. He's excellent in all his interactions with the characters and the unique relationships he forms with each of them, but falls a bit short as an individual.",

Her development, as she grows and learns about what it takes to remain in a cut-throat professional environment is easily reminiscent of the growing pains anyone would experience when first trying a new job; flattery, cynicism, professionalism and laziness are all qualities that Chitose's character has to experience and develop through and it is what places her at fourth place in our Best Protagonist category.",

He also managed to make some natural connections to the entire cast which a leader should be able to. He is still though a type of character we have seen many times before which makes him slightly less interesting, even if it seems like that he might be able to be one of the best in his character genre we didn't really see that in season one. The first season was a prologue, and with some more development in the upcoming season/seasons we might see Midoriya be higher up the list.",

She initially seems indifferent, but, throughout both seasons, she matures into a girl who is willingly ready to be involved in other people's' lives. So, as a girl who focuses on being mundane only to find herself thrust out of her comfort-zone, Kumiko is the perfect foil for Reina, a girl who focuses on being special only to find acceptance from others. Kumiko's characterization also owes heaps to Tomoyo Kurosawa's beautifully grounded performance. Tomoyo handles both drama and comedy with graceful ease, allowing Kumiko to feel like a living, breathing individual who excels as the emotional glue for Hibike Euphonium's vast supporting cast.",

Though some may see his kindness as too much or even detrimental to his friends, his empathy and motherly instincts adds a unique twist to that trope. He stands out from the cast as well as add to the comfy feeling of the show. Along with little quirks such as his fondness for sweets and his fear of ghosts, this gave him a little more depth and personality than Aqua. Ohta provides good support for comedic situations and set the mood of the characters around him, but at times it feels like he is just there, and can be replaced by another character. Ultimately, he is a gag character with not much depth, and there is no justification for him to be ranked any higher in this list.",

With his loud, boisterous nature and true passion for Rakugo, Sukeroku commands every scene he’s in. But the real masterstroke of his character is the subtlety with which his love for Rakugo is contrasted with the depression that takes over his life. With the major framing device of Rakugo Shinjuu being Kikuhiko’s reflections on his performing life, it’s no surprise that the relationship and contrast between the two was the biggest reason why we loved Sukeroku. The tragedy of a talented performer who inspired the same passion in our main character but lost his way, and the redemption he found when his friend helped him rediscover his own passion was a character arc we found just too compelling for us to put Sukeroku anywhere on our list.",

In an all around brilliant cast you get to know each member of the Karasuno school. The character development in this show is amazing, you can feel how much closer the characters gets with every episode. Not only are the Karasuno cast developed, but the show also manage to make their opponents into some great characters. It’s amazing how much the show manage to develop the characters when they are in games, they are able to make the enemies of Karasuno into characters you really love, the biggest candidate for this is Oikawa who is the Karsunos biggest enemy but is still someone you can’t hate. \n\nThe show then proceed to show us why it’s the best cast of the year when it manage to bring us new faces in season three but still is able to bring out some amazing characters/development for it and at the same time make it feel like we have always had those characters in the cast. To make the final boss into such a lovely bunch is no easy feat, but Haikyuu does it perfectly. With a vast cast of characters you always get surprised how Haikyuu manage to make each encounter with a new character into something even more satisfying than the last, to never fail to bring us an exciting character into the hype show that is Haikyuu we are gladly giving it the first spot in the ensemble cast category.\n",

Their design may lack immediate widespread appeal, but it is unquestionably unique and even incorporates the series' logo, as well. \n\nWhile we would have liked to see more usage of the Gomorins in the marketing for Kiznaiver, it is a safe assumption that if this became a franchise on the scale of Pokemon there would be parades of Gomorin costumes just like there are of Pikachu.",

Trigger is definitely unique in their work, and that shines through with Luluco. The vibrant colouring, unique use of lighting and generally bombastic art style earns itself a place on the nominees. Unfortunately, the actual aesthetic fidelity and details of the show are, while fitting, not great enough to warrant it a higher spot on the list.",

The soft beams of light, blurry camera focus and \"lazy\" crayon drawings all add to tanaka's very lazy and simple art style. Very often, the background is a simple gradient or just plain white. But this isn't a case of the studio being lazy, in fact, when there are backgrounds they tend to be very detailed and it's often that soft shadows rest on the characters faces. Unfortunately, this lazy aesthetic, while very effective and well done, doesn't stand out as much as the others on this list, placing Tanaka in a very lazy and comfortable 6th.",

          "writeup": "Due its nature of travelling to various worlds, Flip Flappers has the natural advantage of being able to set up exquisite scenery that is both beautiful as well as being key to understanding the show's core themes and the mental states of its characters. Whereas Hibike's cinematography shines from emulating those of live action, Flip Flappers comes from using camera angles and scenery to recreate optical illusions and famous paintings. Those camera angles, while arguably not as good as Occultic;9's, convey a sense of suffocation when characters are closed off, and of heroism and admiration when those barriers are broken down. And while the use of lighting is not as dynamic as with the two other shows in the top 3, Flip Flappers's use of color is superb and there are still great scenes where the shadows help to convey the duality of the human conscious. Finally, when talking about cinematography, it is hard not to overlook the brilliant display in Episode 5. The colors, the repetition of scenes and the lighting all come together in a perfect mix to set the atmosphere for the episode. The use of camera is always close to make the viewer feel trapped and obscure information to create a sense of dread. The long hallways shots and and imposing shots of the eerily red clock tower give us a taste of the diminutiveness and powerlessness that our heroines feel when trapped in the defense mechanism of the Amorphous. When they finally exit from Pure Illusion, a rippling, reflective shot of their own clock tower over a puddle is there as a bittersweet reminder that the problems represented by the world they were in are not completely gone. Admittedly there are some low moments (relative to the rest of the nominees) in Flip Flapper's cinematography, but in it's highs, Flip Flappers leverages it not only to accentuate its storytelling and themes, but actively add onto them.",

These characters and creatures may have innumerable distinct origins and influences, but Concrete Revolutio's excellent character design both keeps all of these charactesr looking totally unique and ensures that all of them fit in just fine with the show's half-real-half-cartoon general art style.\n\nAdditionally, many of the characters sport numerous outfits and/or transformations. In particular, as the show changes from the idealistic early 1960s to a later, vastly more cynical time period the characters' outfits and appearances change in tandem with their changing social roles: Government supporters don police-like uniforms whilst outlaws grow more visually rebellious and individualistic.\n\nMost impressive of all, however, is how Concrete Revolutio visually incorporates its real-world character inspirations. Nearly all of the main and secondary characters' designs are homages to the real-world characters that they are based upon (and whom they've replaced in the ConRevo universe). Earth-chan looks much like a combination of Astro Boy and Space Ace, Grosse Augen takes after Ultraman, Megasshin is Kikaider, etc.",

          "writeup": "With characters frantically vaulting across the screen in everything from dark tunnels to brightly lit landscapes and camera-work that pans and spins around in every action scene, Kabaneri's character design faces a difficult challenge of ensuring that all of its characters are easy to visually track against a multitude of diverse backgrounds, even at breakneck speeds and without a rooted audience perspective. Furthermore, it all has to fit within an art style that uses high-contrast shading, occasional high-saturation colourings, and integrates CG with its 2D animation.\n\nKabaneri attacks this titanic challenge with grace and aplomb. The main characters feature multiple colours and contrasting shades in their designs (e.g. Ikoma sports green hair, blue pants, yellow gas tanks, a red cape and exposed skin tones) that make their flips and turns easy to follow against any background, and even the kabani themselves sport glowing streaks or bits of coloured clothing that make them easier to track than just a grey/brown blob. The paletting choices keep all the colouring from looking cartoony, and there's even digital make-up effects being used to add detail to more dramatic scene without compromising the designs.\n\nHowever, these design strengths are undermined by a lack of contrast between the characters' designs, especially amongst the recurring secondary characters, and several unusual costuming choices that don't fully fit the theme of the series. Additionally, the way the designs can support the action is frequently undermined by the digital effects - fires, smoke, darkened scenes, etc - which reduce the visual contrast.",

While there were some great symbols and metaphors in the design of the costumes, that's really all it had going for it. The school uniforms were relatively generic, and most of the side characters did not have memorable designs or silhouettes. The designs in Pure Illusion and the transformed outfits were much better and memorable. While Flip Flappers certainly had good enough design to stand with the other nominees, the lackluster side characters and real life outfits put it as our 6th place nominee.",

The class of 2016 showed a wide range of designs associated with what defines a hero. From Deku's All Might knockoff costume to a Ninja Turtle Bakugo, each character has a superhero costume that fits their own quirks and personality.  It is also important to note that in the case of Boku no Hero Academia, it is not just the heroes who take the centre stage when it comes to design. The League of Villains, or the antagonists, also received the same treatment when it comes to being \"fleshed\" out in terms of detail and colour. With a large colour palette that complements each individual costume, each character is able to gather his/her position within this bright, vibrant world developed by Bones.\n\nThe only thing that My Hero Academia suffered from is the underlying fact that these designs do not shine as bright as the other series mentioned, however the jury are looking forward to see the class of 2k16 transition into something bigger and better in 2017.",

There is a ton of smart symbolism, too much to unpack is a short writeup, and the density of which is all solely focused on showing Rei's struggle to the viewer in the most visually interesting and emotionally resonant way. This singular focus does wonders for the show, and the bittersweet song that Bump of Chicken provides for the OP is a perfect fit for 3-gatsu's tone. Great Days' different versions and unique aesthetic ultimately won over in the end, but 3-gatsu's balance of substance and style perfectly communicates Rei's character to the audience and easily deserves its hard-won second place spot.",

The recurring themes of water are shown not only in the setting but also in the transitions and backgrounds making every aspect of this ED complement each other perfectly. The visuals are a great match to the track by Bump of Chicken making for an ED that's symbolic, atmospheric and oh so impressive. Fighter is a great example of an ED where every part works together and matches in a way that makes it even greater than the sum of its parts, and making for an absolutely fantastic second place.",

Its visuals consist of various carefully drawn and animated shots of the main four girls holding bouquets of flowers standing in front of a white background. At first glance the ED might seem standard but the beauty of it lies in the subtleties, as the bouquet each girl is holding and the flowers shown represent their personality, role in the story and dreams in a very subtle way. Each flower has a meaning that nods to one of these aspects making the bouquets shown each tell us a lot about these characters, and with the added factor that flowers play a role in Kiznaiver itself these bouquets hold a lot of meaning and foreshadowing. On top of that the shots, while simple. are carefully composed to give nods to events in the series or show us part of their personality, making for a simple yet meaningful ED with a beautiful song to go with it.",

          "writeup": "Vivace is just plain fun. After a drama heavy episode of Hibike, having such an upbeat song to close things off feels surprisingly cathartic, especially when considering that they use the VA's for the song itself. Along with that, the sequence is gorgeous and visually playful, especially seeing how they animate hair when the girls are running. It also wins major props for telling its own story about finding Kumiko finding joy through music, mirroring much of her arc throughout the first season of Hibike. Ultimately though, the sequence lacks substance when compared to most others on the list, and fails to add much of anything to the show proper beyond being a catchy and charismatic ED. It's above-average production values and playful style earn it a spot on the list, but the lack of meat on its bones ranks it here among the other especially great nominees.",

It tells a story of vengeance fueled by determination as Karasuno gets fired up to face off for the second time against Aoba Johsai. The art style was very clean, using black-and-white with just a touch of colours on the team's jersey's and ball to make them pop. The song is great with a slow but steady ramp-up to the payoff where our protagonists\"snap\" into full colour and are on the court ready to get their revenge. At times it seemed like there was a lack of stuff happening since scenes lingered for a bit too long and tended to look similar to the last. Hatsunetsu's strong narrative and bangin' song earns it a spot on this list but the mildly boring direction don't help it place higher than the EDs above it.",

Finally, the song is super chill and a great way to unwind after an intense stand battle.\n\nThis isn't to say that the ED is perfect, however. The scrolling of the camera doesn't always work, especially as more elements are added to the ED in the final legs of the series, creating a sense of visual clutter that can be difficult to follow. In addition, it lacks substance beyond the characters, with no real symbolism or foreshadowing to speak of when compared to the DiU OPs. Ultimately, the balance between I Want You's strengths and flaws make it end up at a respectable 7th place.",

This visual presentation reflects upon the show's main narrative focus (the dynamic between the leads and their adventures), reinforcing it in a cute and charming way that feels completely unique and absolutely excellent.

There are gorgeous songs that didn't actually appear in full while the show was running and great performance pieces but once you look at the rest of the show, it all starts to fall a little flat. They're great songs to have just going in the background and the whole soundtrack is gorgeous, but they're a little uninteresting. While it's more of a cinematography mark, a couple of our judges were impressed by the accuracy with which the instruments are animated. This feature, however, was not enough to push our opinion of it as a sound track any higher.",

The string instruments are used to great effect to encapsulate Subaru's desire of not wanting to die, his psychological trauma of losing everything over and over again in his mind and his struggles against his inescapable fate. \"Requiem of Silence\", which was used in the 15th episode was able to communicate the feelings witnessing an horrendous event followed by the dread of lingering hopelessness. The album is filled with similar standout tracks, which is why we consider it to be the  best OST of 2016.\n",

The supporting cast is as you would expect for your average One Piece story with a new addition for Nami's backstory that gives them a deeper connection. That being said, there were definitely faults. For those who aren't familiar with the series, it's a bit tougher to follow and enjoy as much, but still a good showing. The main villain in the movie is brought about as the villain quite well, but a shoe-horned backstory that is supposed to make you sympathize with him, feels completely disjointed as the villain never reflects on it or makes any notice to change based on past experiences. Overall a solid movie amongst the list of other nominees.",

Konosuba and Rakugo Shinjuu in particular stood out as strong Anime of the Year candidates that excelled in what both shows sought out to accomplish. While other studios on this list may have had 1 really amazing stand out show, Deen managed to put out 2 within the same season. While Sakamoto and Tonkatsu DJ were both good, Super Lovers was definitely a small but polarizing mark on their otherwise strong year. Deen’s great lineup of productions earns them a narrowly taken spot for the runner up of the year.",
