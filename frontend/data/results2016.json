Ikta and Yatori are the standout characters, and their platonic relationship is beautifully portrayed and rarely seen in anime. The show doesn't bring anything revolutionary to the table, but is still an entertaining watch, and well placed as fifth on the list.",

          "writeup": "Momokuri is almost oppressively cute, but over the course of the show, the characters discover they need to learn to accept the unique quirks of each other's personalities in order to make their relationship work. It starts off right away with a confession and relationship, rather than pussyfooting around with one character summoning the courage to confess for 8 episodes. Even though both the main characters are ultra-shy and inexperienced, they still push themselves to progress their relationship, even if it's in tiny ways. Yuki's incessant stalking of Momo comes off as cute and funny rather than creepy and off-putting. Our main complaint is that the series meanders a bit too much in the middle and major progression between the main characters stalls until the final episodes.",

          "writeup": "Orange is a show that tries to demonstrate how love and friendship can literally save a person's life. However, a romance can live and die by the strength of its main pairing. Naho and Kakeru leave a lot to be desired. Naho is frustratingly lacking in agency and emotional intelligence, and doesn't have any other interesting facets or backstory to make up for it. Kakeru is, understandably, not focused on romance because he has other demons to deal with first. When the romance between a side pairing is infinitely more fun to watch, your main pairing has a lot of work to do. We would love to reach out our hand to Orange, but we're not sure the show would understand what we meant by that gesture. Not recommended.",

The passion and electricity between Yuri and Viktor was palpable and kept us all on the edge of our seats from episode to episode. Whether they were running to each other in the airport, or swiftly skating to rinkside for a hug, the almost desperate desire to be close to one another made Yuri and Viktor's romance very intriguing to follow. Unfortunately, it seemed that the show was always holding something back, for all the scenes it did give us. From the \"kiss\" scene to the \"engagement\" ring they almost playfully avoid making anything explicit to the extent that someone could make an argument that their relationship isn't one of romantic love, but rather based only on admiration and friendship. It is difficult to pinpoint if Yuri even truly understands the difference between romantic love and admiration or gratitude. The show further avoids romantic interactions by focusing heavily on skating in its second half, which left a ton of loose threads to be resolved in a final episode, which still never made clear what feelings Yuri had for Viktor as a lover, as a coach, as a competitor, or as a friend. We hope the show wholeheartedly embraces its subtext in future seasons.",

She is a strong, capable, and independent woman who has the determination and kind charisma to succeed without the help of the princely suitors in her life. Throughout the second season Prince Zen and Shirayuki are separated for long periods of time, but Shirayuki takes these opportunities to earn the respect of everyone around her and change her kingdom for the better. All the while, Zen and Shirayuki's love for each other only grows deeper, even from a great distance, as they overcome all obstacles to return to each others' side. When the two finally do reunite, they are on more equal footing, and the romance between them is justified in both the eyes of the kingdom and the viewer. Even while they are apart, the romantic side stories between other cast members will do plenty to keep romance fans grinning from ear to ear.",

Sadly this show struggles in a classic romance sense, because it is an incomplete adaptation. One could potentially choose to view the show as a Romeo & Juliet-style tragic romance where the two mains grow fonder of each other, but whose relationship is star-crossed and seems like it will never resolve itself. In any case, the main pairing sees little progression in this first season, so we are left to wonder at what might be.",

It aims a little too high unfortunately, having just too many characters to consistently keep track of, and one too many coincidences to keep the suspension of disbelief going. What's worse, the show introduces new characters early in the season, only to have them absent from most of the major events due to their lack of involvement. The unnecessary extra Saikas, combined with the forced reset to status quo at the end, leaves the show thing feeling empty without stakes. It had its thrills, and the plot managed to get its message across in an interesting way, but Durarara is just held back by too many flaws to take it higher on this list.",

The show did a great job living up to illustrious titles like Godfather, Scarface, and Goodfellas. The creators used every trick from those classic mafia thrillers, and they use them well. Inventive cinematography combined with a rich genre history of symbolism make for a compelling watch. However, the lack of creativity leads to a plot you can see coming from a mile off, which is why it's only able to claim second place. But even then, it's worth giving recognition to a rock solid execution of a simple concept.",

Unfortunately after that point, the show has difficulty hitting its stride and really tying all the loose ends together well.

Sure, he gets mixed up with a serial killer along the way, but he takes a backseat in that. While Jotaro and Rohan are hunting a murderer, Josuke is going to school and coming up with clever money making schemes. The issue is, he's not the best character in his own show; he's arguably not even the most important character in his own show. One could make a strong case that the only reason Josuke is even considered the main character is that Koichi has a little less screen time and his name isn't in the title. Josuke also doesn't really have a character arc or any character development to speak of. Unlike Koichi or Rohan, he's a static character who acts exactly the same at the beginning of the Part as at the end. He's excellent in all his interactions with the characters and the unique relationships he forms with each of them, but falls a bit short as an individual.",

Her development, as she grows and learns about what it takes to remain in a cut-throat professional environment is easily reminiscent of the growing pains anyone would experience when first trying a new job; flattery, cynicism, professionalism and laziness are all qualities that Chitose's character has to experience and develop through and it is what places her at fourth place in our Best Protagonist category.",

She initially seems indifferent, but, throughout both seasons, she matures into a girl who is willingly ready to be involved in other people's' lives. So, as a girl who focuses on being mundane only to find herself thrust out of her comfort-zone, Kumiko is the perfect foil for Reina, a girl who focuses on being special only to find acceptance from others. Kumiko's characterization also owes heaps to Tomoyo Kurosawa's beautifully grounded performance. Tomoyo handles both drama and comedy with graceful ease, allowing Kumiko to feel like a living, breathing individual who excels as the emotional glue for Hibike Euphonium's vast supporting cast.",

One enviable aspect to Pikari is how she regularly seeks out the happiness and little joys in life, something which ultimately rubs off on much of the cast. Unfortunately while Pikari does a lot for Teko, she herself goes through little development as it takes a backseat, leaving much to be desired. Because of this Pikari doesn't feel as complex as other nominees, and for some, her bouncy personality can come across as a bit annoying.",

The interaction between the characters is very well made as it progresses smoothly and naturally depending on the relationship between the characters, there’s a lot sense to make in the interaction and it moves forward by using all characters rather than only having a select few speak.\n\nThe characterization is another strong point of JoJo as well but not in the traditional sense, JoJo has always done as it pleases with the characters and it still does, but it works fantastically and adds to the flair that makes up the insanity that is JoJo which is why it’s so glorious, but most of all the cast is very fun, they’re all amazingly fun to follow as very modern teenage punks, very relatable to those of us who grew up in the 90’s following the TV-shows from that era, and while doing this still keeping the JoJo-esque mysterious aura. Very strong ensemble cast in general from Diamond is Unbreakable hence it takes our 2nd place.",

Performance scenes are consistently impressive, with an intense dedication to detail in things as minor as the fingerings used to play certain instruments, and with the instruments being done largely in 2D animation. Character animation was similarly great, with subtle details helping to sell the emotions of each scene, and to flesh out the intricacies of each character through their expressive behaviors. The series thrives off of these minor details, and the subtle actions and visual quirks given to characters in more routine moments breathe life into scenes that would be bland in any other show. The biggest mark against Hibike is the static nature of the series, with its sheer consistency not being able to top the expressive and innovative cuts seen in Mob and FLFL, placing it as a more than worthy third.",

In director Yuzuru Tachikawa's words, the experience would be like \"opening a box of very fun surprises\". From the painstakingly crafted paint-on-glass animations of Miyo Sato to the digital animation of webgen animators like Kazuto Arai and Miso, high-quality animation is found in nearly every minute of the series and never stops transcending the expectations of its viewers. Be it the simplest of actions such as Reigen eating takoyaki or the most ferocious of battles like Mob's confrontation with Teruki, Mob Psycho 100 isn't just the best animated show of 2016… It's an animation spectacle for the ages.",

The show generally changes the way it presents itself depending on the severity or theme of the current scene. Some feature cartoony Panty & Stocking styled drawings, while some scenes, especially in the later episodes, turn the details up to 11 to make a certain scene stand out even more. Trigger is definitely unique in their work, and that shines through with Luluco. The vibrant colouring, unique use of lighting and generally bombastic art style earns itself a place on the nominees.

          "writeup": "Due its nature of travelling to various worlds, Flip Flappers has the natural advantage of being able to set up exquisite scenery that is both beautiful as well as being key to understanding the show's core themes and the mental states of its characters. Whereas Hibike's cinematography shines from emulating those of live action, Flip Flappers comes from using camera angles and scenery to recreate optical illusions and famous paintings. Those camera angles, while arguably not as good as Occultic;9's, convey a sense of suffocation when characters are closed off, and of heroism and admiration when those barriers are broken down. And while the use of lighting is not as dynamic as with the two other shows in the top 3, Flip Flappers's use of color is superb and there are still great scenes where the shadows help to convey the duality of the human conscious. Finally, when talking about cinematography, it is hard not to overlook the brilliant display in Episode 5. The colors, the repetition of scenes and the lighting all come together in a perfect mix to set the atmosphere for the episode. The use of camera is always close to make the viewer feel trapped and obscure information to create a sense of dread. The long hallways shots and and imposing shots of the eerily red clock tower give us a taste of the diminutiveness and powerlessness that our heroines feel when trapped in the defense mechanism of the Amorphous. When they finally exit from Pure Illusion, a rippling, reflective shot of their own clock tower over a puddle is there as a bittersweet reminder that the problems represented by the world they were in are not completely gone. Admittedly there are some low moments (relative to the rest of the nominees) in Flip Flapper's cinematography, but in it's highs, Flip Flappers leverages it not only to accentuate its storytelling and themes, but actively add onto them.",

Although Flying Witch may have been good at framing shots, its simplicity is also what keeps it from surpassing any of the shows nominated.",

A great character can’t just look cool, they have to move well too. \n\nCreative design of the character, alongside with the ease of movement in characters, both Kiznaiver and Concrete Revolutio were the forerunners of the list. However, with an inventive display of personality through the character designs in Kiznaiver, it ultimately took out the #1 spot.

These characters and creatures may have innumerable distinct origins and influences, but Concrete Revolutio's excellent character design both keeps all of these charactesr looking totally unique and ensures that all of them fit in just fine with the show's half-real-half-cartoon general art style.\n\nAdditionally, many of the characters sport numerous outfits and/or transformations. In particular, as the show changes from the idealistic early 1960s to a later, vastly more cynical time period the characters' outfits and appearances change in tandem with their changing social roles: Government supporters don police-like uniforms whilst outlaws grow more visually rebellious and individualistic.\n\nMost impressive of all, however, is how Concrete Revolutio visually incorporates its real-world character inspirations. Nearly all of the main and secondary characters' designs are homages to the real-world characters that they are based upon (and whom they've replaced in the ConRevo universe). Earth-chan looks much like a combination of Astro Boy and Space Ace, Grosse Augen takes after Ultraman, Megasshin is Kikaider, etc.",

          "writeup": "With characters frantically vaulting across the screen in everything from dark tunnels to brightly lit landscapes and camera-work that pans and spins around in every action scene, Kabaneri's character design faces a difficult challenge of ensuring that all of its characters are easy to visually track against a multitude of diverse backgrounds, even at breakneck speeds and without a rooted audience perspective. Furthermore, it all has to fit within an art style that uses high-contrast shading, occasional high-saturation colourings, and integrates CG with its 2D animation.\n\nKabaneri attacks this titanic challenge with grace and aplomb. The main characters feature multiple colours and contrasting shades in their designs (e.g. Ikoma sports green hair, blue pants, yellow gas tanks, a red cape and exposed skin tones) that make their flips and turns easy to follow against any background, and even the kabani themselves sport glowing streaks or bits of coloured clothing that make them easier to track than just a grey/brown blob. The paletting choices keep all the colouring from looking cartoony, and there's even digital make-up effects being used to add detail to more dramatic scene without compromising the designs.\n\nHowever, these design strengths are undermined by a lack of contrast between the characters' designs, especially amongst the recurring secondary characters, and several unusual costuming choices that don't fully fit the theme of the series. Additionally, the way the designs can support the action is frequently undermined by the digital effects - fires, smoke, darkened scenes, etc - which reduce the visual contrast.",

The class of 2016 showed a wide range of designs associated with what defines a hero. From Deku's All Might knockoff costume to a Ninja Turtle Bakugo, each character has a superhero costume that fits their own quirks and personality.  It is also important to note that in the case of Boku no Hero Academia, it is not just the heroes who take the centre stage when it comes to design. The League of Villains, or the antagonists, also received the same treatment when it comes to being \"fleshed\" out in terms of detail and colour. With a large colour palette that complements each individual costume, each character is able to gather his/her position within this bright, vibrant world developed by Bones.\n\nThe only thing that My Hero Academia suffered from is the underlying fact that these designs do not shine as bright as the other series mentioned, however the jury are looking forward to see the class of 2k16 transition into something bigger and better in 2017.",

          "writeup": "We felt that no other OP in 2016 was as good of a love letter to its respective series than Great Days was. Along with nailing the conventional criteria for what makes an outstanding anime intro, Great Days also shows some incredible creativity through what very well may be the single best OP alteration we have ever seen. This completely unexpected and marvellously entertaining twist shows a level of pre-planning and ambition that most OPs don't even try to breach. The result is a rich and dynamic credit sequence that perfectly encapsulates both the story's heroes and its main villain simultaneously. Even for a very divisive category like this one, we found it easy to agree on this placement.",

It has an incredible amount of manga references which is really fun and it looks gorgeous with some fantastic, even psychedelic animation, on top of that 99 very rarely makes any hard cut transitions, which feels incredibly unique and makes it a visual standout. In addition, the OP captures Mob's character super well and explains his fears and limits and does various exploration into his relationships.\n\nHowever, the sheer amount manga references were a bit of a double edged sword in our eyes, and there were some parts that were a bit too visually cluttered as well.\n\nEven though the lyrics might not be the most thought out ones the counting is genius for the show and the song is very catchy, 99 will be an opening to remember for sure.",

Where the OP represents Rei's depressed state by showing him drowning in a deep river, this uses similar themes to show us Rei being a \"fighter\" and aspiring to get out of the lonely and dark depths. The recurring themes of water are shown not only in the setting but also in the transitions and backgrounds making every aspect of this ED complement each other perfectly. The visuals are a great match to the track by Bump of Chicken making for an ED that's symbolic, atmospheric and oh so impressive. Fighter is a great example of an ED where every part works together and matches in a way that makes it even greater than the sum of its parts, and making for an absolutely fantastic second place.",

While the opinions on this ED differed quite wildly between judges it ended up taking sixth spot. Hajimari no Sokudo shows us a lot of things in a very subtle way. Its visuals consist of various carefully drawn and animated shots of the main four girls holding bouquets of flowers standing in front of a white background. At first glance the ED might seem standard but the beauty of it lies in the subtleties, as the bouquet each girl is holding and the flowers shown represent their personality, role in the story and dreams in a very subtle way. Each flower has a meaning that nods to one of these aspects making the bouquets shown each tell us a lot about these characters, and with the added factor that flowers play a role in Kiznaiver itself these bouquets hold a lot of meaning and foreshadowing. On top of that the shots, while simple. are carefully composed to give nods to events in the series or show us part of their personality, making for a simple yet meaningful ED with a beautiful song to go with it.",

After a drama heavy episode of Hibike, having such an upbeat song to close things off feels surprisingly cathartic, especially when considering that they use the VA's for the song itself. Along with that, the sequence is gorgeous and visually playful, especially seeing how they animate hair when the girls are running. It also wins major props for telling its own story about finding Kumiko finding joy through music, mirroring much of her arc throughout the first season of Hibike. Ultimately though, the sequence lacks substance when compared to most others on the list, and fails to add much of anything to the show proper beyond being a catchy and charismatic ED. It's above-average production values and playful style earn it a spot on the list, but the lack of meat on its bones ranks it here among the other especially great nominees.",

The art style was very clean, using black-and-white with just a touch of colours on the team's jersey's and ball to make them pop. The song is great with a slow but steady ramp-up to the payoff where our protagonists\"snap\" into full colour and are on the court ready to get their revenge. At times it seemed like there was a lack of stuff happening since scenes lingered for a bit too long and tended to look similar to the last. Hatsunetsu's strong narrative and bangin' song earns it a spot on this list but the mildly boring direction don't help it place higher than the EDs above it.",

Finally, the song is super chill and a great way to unwind after an intense stand battle.\n\nThis isn't to say that the ED is perfect, however. The scrolling of the camera doesn't always work, especially as more elements are added to the ED in the final legs of the series, creating a sense of visual clutter that can be difficult to follow. In addition, it lacks substance beyond the characters, with no real symbolism or foreshadowing to speak of when compared to the DiU OPs. Ultimately, the balance between I Want You's strengths and flaws make it end up at a respectable 7th place.",

Though the variety of noises Tomoyo makes are fantastic, what truly sets her acting apart is her intonation.  The change in tone Kumiko has between the lower, apathetic voice she uses when with her family versus the high pitched voice she uses among Hazuki and Midori is subtle but noticeable.  Such clever intonation adds a layer of depth to her character that would otherwise not exist had she talked with her family exactly like she talked with her friends.  Tomoyo Kurosawa would have been a surefire win for best voice actress had it not been for how unbelievably fantastic Ishida Akira's performance in Rakugo was.",

We first see him as the dignified Master of his craft, with his detached demeanor and biting tongue, before he slips into otherworldly character as a shinigami and captivates both the local audience and the viewer alike. The story follows Yakumo's life in rakugo from a young starving actor, into a rising talent, and eventually through the ranks to the reluctant role of Master. Ishida perfectly captures the fledgling Bon, the seductive Kikuhiko, and the absolute mastery of Yakumo… all while providing the audience with glimpses into the threads that bind these and other variations of the same character.",

While it deals with some mature themes very well, it doesn't really have anything to offer outside of the relationship and is largely monotonous.",

Most of its animation is also fairly mundane - competent but nothing particularly exemplary. But there is nothing mundane about Anthem's engrossing writing which grips your heart within moments of the film's beginning and holds it through a satisfying build-up of themes and emotion all the way until the climactic finale. Nor is there anything mundane about the directing, which makes expert use of differing art styles to highlight the fantastical conceits of the narrative in a way that only anime can.\n\nAdditionally, Anthem presents a masterclass in character animation. The \"character acting\" of Naruse in particular is a revelation, showcasing a plethora of complex and intertwined emotions.\n\nAdd to all of that some great sound design, characters that will defy your expectations, and a heart-pounding finale - Anthem of the Heart was by far our standout winner for best film of the year.

The decision to parallel Mamiko and Asuka's arc provides the show with a lot of dramatic heft; and is the bedrock of, the show's emotive and memorable conclusion, and its sixth place on the list.",

Layered with symbols and references, and hiding a deeper narrative about a young girls struggle for identity and self, Flip Flappers' twisted bildungsroman was a veritable adventure onto itself. As any work of art, the show's depth depends on your own input and interpretation of its text, subtext and metatext, and writing about them could fill entire essays, but even as a piece of entertainment it's enthralling adventures make it a deserving candidate for the third best show of the year.",

Its blatant disregard for the most elementary rules of writing is its greatest strength, and its eccentricity its greatest appeal, neglecting plausibility in service of uncompromising and exhilarating climaxes, even if its two strengths may not appeal to everyone, it easily earned itself fifth place.

The show's penchant for overusing certain gags, and a slightly weak side cast, were the only real negatives. Aside from that it features some fantastic VA performances, an ingenious soundtrack, top notch comic timing, and Deen's unique and charming animation. It's a hilarious romp of a drunk DnD session, that deserves its place as one of the best shows of the year.",

A period drama about two young actors set throughout the initial decline and then postwar resurgence of their craft, the best word for Rakugo's charm is intoxication. The show immerses you in its world; whether by the sensuous jazz and tattoo of drums accompanying the theatre performances, the layered performances of the voice actors who quite literally breathe life into the script, or simply the streets and nightlife of the 1950s swirling around you, Rakugo draws you further and further downward toward a predestined (yet still satisfying) conclusion. If the rest of this list showcases excellent animation, action, and exuberance, Rakugo is unique in its more subdued yet equally passionate artistic vision. Fans of more traditional fare might balk at the concept, however the jury was nearly unanimous in their acclaim… Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu is modern masterpiece.",

          "writeup": "Oh, Re:Zero. Certainly, it was the most talked about show of the year, as it took an unexpectedly dark spin on the currently trending isekai premise. What sells this anime as one of the best series of the year is its harshly critical take on the \"otaku hero\" protagonist, hitting so close to home it hurts. That makes it a show you can't simply walk past by, even if you take issue with some of its flaws. Admittedly it's one of those Light Novel adaptations that never manage to give justice to the true potential of its fantasy world and enough screentime to the broad ensemble cast it presents, but what we saw was enough to keep the audience on the edge of its seat, and even without any hope of continuation, it's striking emotional core, whose dramatic impact struck a chord with many in the jury, earns it a well-deserved seventh place on the list.",
