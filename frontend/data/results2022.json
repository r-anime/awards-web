After watching any necessary prerequisites before the main entries, the jury discussed extensively to decide on the nominees. Although some jurors had individual preferences, there was an overall consensus on the final nominees: *Cucuruz Doan* is a nice homage to the earlier days of *Gundam*, *JoJo Stone Ocean* has one of the most charismatic protagonists and an impactful ending, *86 Part 2* is an emotional roller-coaster with an astounding climax, and *Kimetsu no Yaiba: Yuukaku-hen* stands out for its superb animation and creative use of CGI.  However, four nominees definitively stole the spotlight since the beginning of the discussion. *Jujutsu Kaisen 0*'s superb animation and creative use of angles help showcase unique fights among curses and sorcerers. Alongside this is the strong comeback of *Bleach*, whose revamped yet nostalgic aesthetics excited a fanbase eagerly awaiting its return. Finally, the coming-of-age journey in *Mob Psycho* closes with a sublime and captivating ending, and *Chainsaw Man*'s cinematic approach effectively portrays the raw, thrilling feeling of the story and action scenes.",

          "writeup": "*Gundam: Cucuruz Doan* is a blast from the past, as it tackles the monumental task of adapting the contents of a lost episode from the original series into a full-length film. It tells the story of Amuro Ray's time with Cucuruz Doan, a deserted enemy soldier living with a group of kids. Ample time is spent developing Cucuruz Doan and his relationship with his family, allowing Amuro and the viewer to empathize with Cucuruz. Amuro is a standard yet likable protagonist who receives good character moments, such as the flashback to his family's conflicting ideologies that add to his depth. \n\nThe show's visual presentation is also impressive, with the art style remaining faithful to the original. In addition, the CGI used in the show is top-class: the mechs' movements feel heavy yet precise, creating an atmosphere that supports the grounded and realistic war setting in which the film takes place.\n\nWhile *Cucuruz Doan* has several charming qualities, it struggles to stand out among the other nominees. The story has good execution but lacks the nuance and depth to make it exceptional. The side characters are also serviceable, though their actions are not entirely memorable. Moreover, the villains and their relationship to Cucuruz are hinted at; however, the film fails to capitalize on this, which results in the enemies being one-dimensional characters that exist just to be opponents for Amuro and Cucuruz. Still, *Cucuruz Doan* is a compelling retelling of an original episode worthy of watching, especially for fans of *Gundam*.",

          "writeup": "A conclusion to a long-standing conflict of the Joestar family against Dio and his allies, *JoJo: Stone Ocean* stands out for its creativity in its plot twists, stand fights, and unique characters. Jolyne and Pucci, the main protagonist and antagonist, respectively, are the show's main attractions. Their distinctive designs, nuanced personalities, and interesting backstories elevate their feud to another level.  \n\nHowever, the same cannot be said for the rest of the cast, as their performance is more of a mixed bag. For instance, Hermes, who initially has a compelling backstory and motivations, merely becomes another sidekick as the story progresses. In addition, the conclusion may feel a bit unsatisfactory, as characters like Weather Report receive minimal closure and a plot hole that becomes relatively apparent during the show.\n\nOn the production side, studio David Production's commitment to varying color palettes and emphasis on characters' reactions proved effective. These elements helped convey each character's thoughts and emotions explicitly while enhancing the aesthetics of the franchise it's well known for. An iconic example of this would be the series's climax, as it portrayed a sense of shock and awe at the bizarre events unfolding at the time.\n\nEven with its flaws, *Stone Ocean* will be remembered in a good light, not only because it brings a nice closure to the long-running history of the Joestar family, but also because it's one of the best examples of an engaging story with *JoJo*'s first female lead.\n",

          "writeup": "*Jujutsu Kaisen 0* is a movie with a simple yet engaging premise of sorcerers and evil curses. Its self-contained nature also makes it approachable to those who haven't seen the main series, as the viewer gets invested in Yuuta and roots for him on his quest to free his deceased childhood friend from her curse.\n\nThe vibrant animation, combined with creative angles, gives a more expansive outlook during its scenes. This is replicated well when the movie addresses the curses and how dreadful they are—particularly when Yuuta sets Rikka loose for the first time—and when illustrating its characters' appeal. An example of the latter would be the fight in Kyoto, which features cameos of the series's vast cast in a way that demonstrates their personalities and fighting styles. However, it's Yuuta's climactic battle against Getou when the movie reaches its highest point. It perfectly illustrates the series's unique power system and provides an excellent thematic conclusion to Yuuta and Rikka's story.\n\nUnfortunately, the villains and their motivations are not quite captivating, with the only compelling one being Getou, albeit his character still feels underdeveloped. Nevertheless, the movie does well by exploring his background in a way that appears to tease upcoming events in the main series.\n\nWhile *Jujutsu Kaisen 0*'s premise may appear too simplistic, the engaging performance of charismatic characters and visual spectacles makes the movie an adaptation worth watching that departs from the main series.\n",

With the newest villains Yhwach and the Wandenreich proving to be the strongest enemies the soul reapers have faced, the tightly paced first cour is intense, containing some of the most spectacular fight scenes in the series. The world is also expanded upon greatly by introducing new members of the soul society and Ichigo having to learn the truth about himself.\n\n*Bleach* receives a fresh coat of paint in its production that maintains a novel yet familiar style. The use of recognizable tracks, such as the remix of “Number One,” adds to the excitement of the fight scenes in the show while also being nostalgic to viewers of the original series. In addition, the voice actors for both the Japanese and English return to deliver a heartfelt and evocative performance that captures the personalities of the characters many fell in love with ten years ago.\n\nWhile *Bleach* improves in several aspects, it has yet to overcome the issues that were originally present. The use of CGI of questionable quality stands out against the well-animated characters and backgrounds, and the large ensemble pushes a few characters to the wayside. Despite these faults, the spectacle of *Bleach* holds the show together with its strong return to finishing the series, serving as a reminder of why it was a member of the big three all those years ago.\n",

          "writeup": "*86 Part 2* continues its thrilling war drama as the cast bids the Republic farewell. Instead of dealing with the toils of war, surviving members of the spearhead squadron now must consider what comes next. Combined with a memorable soundtrack by Hiroyuki Sawano and cinematic work directed by Toshimasa Ishii, *Part 2* presents a compelling continuation with excellent production work.  \n\nShin remains the stoic protagonist driving this narrative forward as he interacts with members of the Empire that have embraced the surviving 86. His struggles following the events of *Part 1* and the emotional impact they've left on him are poignant. The remaining members of the Spearhead Legion all have genuine reactions to dealing with a second chance at life that was engaging before moving on to the next conflict. \n\nHowever, many new characters fail to expand past their base personalities. For example, in Lena's absence from most of this cour, Frederica is introduced as a counterpart to Shin. Although her motivations lead into *Part 2*'s final conflict, her character arc feels unsatisfying, and ultimately Shin's continued characterization overshadows it. Still, the production quality, mainly the cinematography, remains noteworthy. During a meeting in episode 22, the flowers' colors, sunlight, and angle shot help portray the scene's emotions effectively. \n\nWhile *86 Part 2* may not be an action-packed blockbuster compared to its competition, its engaging narrative themes, beautiful soundtrack, and stunning cinematic scenes make for an enjoyable and memorable experience that continues from where it left off. \n",

          "writeup": "*Mob Psycho 100 III* is a fantastic swan song to the franchise that offers satisfying conclusions to the ongoing character arcs of the series's cast. While not quite reaching the visual highs of season two, studio BONES's continued commitment to a fully hand-drawn, low-line-count art style remains commendable. It enables both the flashy action scenes and exaggerated comedic moments to shine to their fullest. Dimple vs. the Psycho Helmets stands out for its stellar camera work, emphasizing the sense of scale and weight of impacts during the battle.\n\nFrom solving problems and making decisions independently to not being afraid of Tsubomi's rejection, Mob reaches a gratifying apex in his character growth, where he finally learns to accept all parts of himself. Major and minor side characters each have their moment to shine in the final arc as well. They're given a resounding character resolution and contribute to that of Mob's. Reigen and Dimple exemplify how much they've evolved from the seedy characters they started out as, to ones that are more honest with others and themselves, embodying the show's themes.\n\nThe inclusion of a crucial plot that slightly undermines the emotional weight of a scene earlier in the season did not hold the show back from excellence. Thus, the emotional highs and fantastic visual presentation of *Mob Psycho 100 III* lead to a fulfilling experience that perfectly concludes the series.",

          "writeup": "*Kimetsu no Yaiba: Yuukaku-hen* doubles down on the flashy animation the series is known for while raising the stakes for Tanjiro and his allies. Studio Ufotable's excellent balance of smooth 2D character animation with CG background elements helps them create intense fight scenes with dynamic camera angles apparent in the season's climactic finale. The bombastic sound design works in tandem with the visuals to make these action scenes some of the most memorable in recent years.\n\nAlthough the core cast does not receive much development this season, new characters like Daki and Tengen have memorable moments due in part to the prideful and confident vocal performances of Miyuki Sawashiro and Katsuyuki Konishi, respectively. Comedic moments from Tanjiro, Zenitsu, and Inosuke's interactions with Tengen are another strong point this season. These moments rarely felt like they clashed with the scene's tone, a tendency in prior seasons.\n\nHowever, some of the plot holes in the final few episodes of the season stand out as rough, taking into account the established rules and power system. The plot structure also feels formulaic. The latter half concludes similarly to every major arc the series has had so far, with the decapitation and subsequent humanization of the villains via flashback. Despite these flaws, Studio Ufotable executed emotional moments successfully. This, along with the compelling character interactions and impressive production work, leaves *Kimetsu no Yaiba* on a higher note than in previous seasons with the adaptation of the *Yuukaku-hen* arc.\n",

          "writeup": "*Chainsaw Man* is a distinctive narrative that manages to ground itself in cinematic reality and visually exciting action through the directing by Ryuu Nakayama. Denji's unique goals and motivations, which may not be necessarily noble nor ambitious, break the mold in shounen protagonists in a way that makes for an intriguing character. Stemming from a distressing background, his perverse ideals are not merely present for fanservice but rather for him to learn that there's more to the action than itself. Denji may have a few immature goals, yet they're relatable to an extent and help him develop as a human, given his past. \nIn addition, his interactions with fellow characters Power and Aki are a highlight of the show and help center Denji as a character. Aki's straightforward and honest demeanor plays counter to Power's narcissistic and chaotic behavior, which meshes well with the different aspects of Denji's personality. The adaptation also enables certain elements to demonstrate the varying ways to perceive a character, particularly facial expressions and body language. Makima illustrates this concept perfectly, where various scenes frame her as an intimidating presence that instills anxiety among those near her. Differences in scenes featuring her and Denji alone compared to those consisting of other characters are prominent, intentionally representing varying levels of intimacy. \nTherefore, *Chainsaw Man*'s thrilling first installment is full of passion, evident in multiple areas from the OP/EDs, directing work, and unique visuals. It's a strong start that excites viewers for what is to come.\n",

Adventure was a category filled to the brim with options, and the process of narrowing it down to eight was harder than one might think. Great entries such as Dr Stone: Ryuusui, Danmachi, and Totsukuni no Shoujo are among some of the competitive options that didn’t make the cut.  Even after narrowing down the wide variety of options, the nominations still showcase the category’s diversity. Adventure is category rife with Isekai, however only three were able to rise above the rest to receive nominations. The more traditional fantasy stories of *Ousama Ranking* and *Dragon Quest* stood out by having narratives that were more direct due to characters with motivations grounded in their world from the start.  Additionally, *Goodbye, DonGlees!* and *Tropical-Rouge Precure,* set in the modern world, stood out in a sea of fantasy worlds. Both entries are character focused, and the difference between rural and urban settings allowed them to tell vastly different and enjoyable stories.    Ranking each of the nominations proved a challenge as jurors found various elements stronger than others, however after much deliberation, a consensus was reached. With no further ado, we present what we believe to be the best adventure anime of 2022.",

          "writeup": "*Goodbye, DonGlees!* presents the delightful shenanigans of Roma, Toto, and Drop as the trio faces disaster following a nearby forest fire. While it's not the grandest of narratives compared to the rest of the nominations, it stands out due to its fantastic cast and their ambitions, camaraderie, and ignorance of the world around them. They each have a distinct personality and their own take on life as they teeter on the edge of adulthood. \n\nA major theme of the film is that the trio overestimates the significance and importance of their actions to the world around them. In the end, they're just three teenagers in a rural Japanese town. However, their overblown reaction drives them to go on their journey and causes the friends to grow closer as a result of the experience.\n\nMuch like some of the other entries, the film suffers from an ending that isn't as satisfying as the adventure preceding it. The conclusion feels very abrupt, as the film jumps from an emotional tragedy to the twist that ties our characters together. This portion of the film really needed more time to breathe, and its brevity dampens the impact of its final scenes. Nevertheless, *Goodbye! DonGlees!* takes viewers on an impactful journey following the trio that proves well worth the experience.  ",

          "writeup": "In a time where popular adaptations of video games are becoming the norm, *Dragon Quest: Dai no Daibouken* was quietly ahead of the game in 2020. *The Adventure of Dai* is a readaptation of the manga of the same name, previously adapted in 1991. It's an epic of a journey that sees every character truly grow over the course of its 100-episode run time. \n\nThe show is a beautiful love letter to the franchise, with the source material based closely on the world of Dragon Quest III. As such, various monsters, items and spells are all drawn from its world in a way that requires no knowledge of the games while giving proper reverence to each one. Additionally, just as characters in the game obtain constant equipment improvements, so does our cast, and you truly feel like they've “leveled up” from an encounter as their weaponry and armor change.\n\nA core theme of the show is ‘being a hero', and a large part of the cast embodies this throughout. Dai in particular is confronted not just with powerful enemies but the weight of expectations that come with that title. Every victory feels earned in a way that keeps the theme engaging throughout the show's runtime. \n\nOften a grand adventure can feel marred by a confusing or disappointing ending, but *Dai no Daibouken* delivers a conclusion as delightful as its journey. Not a single episode goes to waste, with the most consistent episode quality in the category, and most importantly it nails the landing. It truly earns its place as the Best Adventure of 2022.",

Precure* is a lighter and softer entry of the *Precure* franchise that makes use of its tropical aesthetic, vibrant colors, and expressive characters to create a fun and energetic atmosphere. The show is largely run by its characters, especially Manatsu and Laura. The bubbly and enthusiastic Manatsu with endless, but directionless motivation mixes well with the selfish, sassy mermaid who knows exactly what she wants. This power duo gives the slice of life scenes a lot of life and character, and makes many of the scenes charmingly comedic. By the end, Laura's gradual shift into a better and more selfless person and a proper companion to the main cast feels well-earned.\n\nThough Manatsu and Laura take the spotlight, the rest of the main cast is expressive and well-balanced. They make a great team, and each of them gets several dedicated episodes to develop as characters. However, the show's main plot and antagonists aren't very complex or interesting, and the show's formulaic nature requiring a fight against them every episode felt like it added unnecessary conflict to some episodes without meaningfully adding anything to the show's themes or plot. \n\nEven so, *Tropical-Rouge Precure*'s tropical aesthetic and upbeat energy are truly uplifting, and the variety added by Laura being a mermaid and various episodic plots keeps the show fresh, making it feel like the show accomplishes what it has set out to do.",

There are multiple locations in this adventure, which allows the main characters' journey to feel distinct and fresh as they race against time. \n\nThe cast is the show's strongest aspect. Milo and Bisco have great chemistry and feel like they truly went from strangers to brothers by the end. The rest of the cast prove to be strong foils to the main pair, with every major character having clear, but different and at times opposing motivations for their actions.  \n\nUnfortunately, despite the strong cast, *Sabikui's* ending rushes past an emotional midpoint and chooses to jump to levels of insanity that take away from the story beats it already established. Additionally, themes the show had introduced are dropped for a very simple big bad for the hero to defeat. It's a conclusion that didn't match the well crafted world the viewer is introduced to initially. \n\n*Sabikui Bisco's* ludicrous premise and great cast make for an enjoyable show.

It's a straightforward plot, but the protagonists and the trials they overcome as they pursue their goals are the heart of the series, making it a rewarding watch.\n\nFran and the reincarnated sword Shishou quickly grow to be compelling protagonists in a mutually beneficial relationship, and the two act as foils for each other in a way that covers both of their weaknesses well. Fran's impatience, curiosity, and innocence befit her age, and her simple actions and reactions to various situations are incredibly endearing and often funny. By contrast, Shishou's cool headedness, intelligence, and perception allows him to keep Fran on-track and out of trouble. The core cast size of the series is small and tight-knit, with only four characters, which allows for more focus on them, but this unfortunately makes the remainder of the cast seem flat and one-dimensional. \n\nAction scenes feel appropriately tense compared to the enemy's threat level, often feeling like either side could win at any time and that both have options available to them. The world incorporates RPG game elements, but besides learning and using skills, stats feel largely meaningless. With such a solid foundation set by Fran and Shishou and only a few things holding it back, *Tensei Shitara Ken Deshita* puts itself in a great position for its upcoming sequel.",

Ainz and his floor guardians from Nazarick return to the center stage this go-around, for a much-appreciated return to the show's roots.\n\nVisually it doesn't feel like *Overlord* has aged well, with both newer and older CG monsters that clash heavily against the show's backgrounds and 2D characters. In addition, environments are generally barren and visually repetitive, failing to make each environment feel lived-in or interesting. A lot of the world-building appeal comes narratively through what characters say they can do rather than seen through action.\n\nHowever, there is a lot of good to be said about *Overlord IV*'s story and cast, which make a clear effort at improving comedic banter, chemistry between floor guardians, and development among the already established characters. This notably includes Shalltear and other floor guardians acting and thinking more independently, but especially with Ainz himself in a particularly well-executed scene towards the end of the season that sheds a new light on his motivations. The visual flaws and weaker world-building compared to previous seasons bring *Overlord IV* down, but there is no mistaking that it is a satisfying experience for those that like dark fantasy.",

          "writeup": "*Ousama Ranking* is a heartwarming journey filled with courage and betrayal that serves to be the start of something greater. Its strength lies in taking fantasy tropes and making a compelling narrative by subverting them, not allowing characters to be judged by their appearance. The prime example is the main character, Bojji, who is introduced to the audience as mute, deaf and unable to defend himself. However, he proves to be a fantastic hero despite these limitations.\n\nIt is not just our protagonist who subverts traditional character tropes. For example, when Hilling and Daida are introduced, they both initially appear cast in evil roles, including their appearances. The art in *Ousama* feels like it came out of a story book, and Hilling looks like your typical evil step-mother. However, as the story progresses, we're shown that Hilling cares for Bojji, and Daida does want to be a good king. And of course, we have Kage, the shadow who goes from taking the literal clothes off Bojji's back to being the greatest ally the young Prince could ask for. \n\nThe most divisive element of the show is the execution of its ending. While the conclusion itself should be expected given the show's themes of forgiveness and acceptance, characters feel too ready to move on from previous conflicts, regardless of their personality. Despite this, *Ousama Ranking* is a show with a beautiful world, compelling narrative and unique characters that come together to make one of the best adventures of the year.  ",

In addition to the new perspective, the OVA also features its own special, silhouette-animated start to the episode which uses its unique style to introduce a character without any dialogue.\n\nAlthough the OVA stays true to Eris's character, it doesn't feel like it utilizes Eris's perspective well. Instead of using the opportunity to develop her character or otherwise challenge her, she and the newly introduced Cliff end up focusing on Rudeus, with Eris's dialogue largely just being already established praise for Rudeus. Eris's tsundere reactions are also in character but too predictable by this point, making several punchlines fall flat.\n\nAs a result, Eris the Goblin Slayer's short runtime doesn't feel as well-utilized as it could be.

Much of the focus is on the extraction process itself, with repetitive action scenes as the team handles the opposition. This time could have been spent adding depth to the characters, or delving further into why things are the way they are. \n\nWhile these issues limited the show's appeal relative to the other nominees, *Estab Life* is still an upbeat, creative romp that doesn't fail to entertain.

And how the girls overcome their problems during these arcs is often where the show shines. Kyouka's arc in particular, and her realizations about herself, makes her a very compelling character. \n\nSome of the other arcs are more mixed however, particularly in the later half where the motivations of Yukine and Momiji are not entirely believable. Haru's conflict can also be somewhat unrelatable. Additionally, the more individual character focused story structure of *Shine Post* means there is less chemistry between the cast. Even in these weaker parts, though, *Shine Post* carries a tight narrative, and each plot twist has a significant amount of foreshadowing.\n\nPerformances are make or break for idol shows, and *Shine Post*'s have several things going for them. The 2D and 3D elements blend well enough that the 3D is hardly noticeable. Other little things go a long way, such as Haru compensating for Rio's poor dancing abilities causing the choreography to be out of sync at times. The songs are the weakest part of the performances; while they are all fine individually, they don't particularly stand out. The exception is \"Yellow Rose\", a highly emotional ballad that acts as a strong climax to Rio's arc.\n\nWhile the quality isn't consistent throughout, the focus *Shine Post* puts on its characters makes you want to root for your favorites and cheer along with TiNgS' concerts as they progress towards their goal.",

          "writeup": "With strong presentation that makes the cast feel effortlessly matched to their surroundings, *Gyokou no Nikuko-chan* tells the heartwarming tale of a mother and child's experience moving to a remote seaside town. Detailed indoor environments create a welcoming atmosphere, and the idyllic town becomes familiar to viewers and characters alike through repeated shots of recognizable buildings and street corners. Town events stand out via vibrant and distinctive color palettes, with the sound design emphasizing every action, from the clinking of chopsticks against bowls to echoey footsteps on the metal bridge.\n\nThe portrayal of Nikuko is remarkably endearing. Despite enduring tough times in the past, she maintains a positive outlook, with an infectious enthusiasm that captivates the town's inhabitants. Kiku's reserved personality stands in contrast to her mom's cheerful disposition, as she struggles to find her place amongst new surroundings. Her attempts at navigating messy friendships and her growing anxiety about their uncertain future adds some tension to the otherwise calm showcase of daily life. \n\nThe cartoonish depiction of Nikuko's obesity is likely to raise some eyebrows. Her alarming eating habits are often displayed front and center, yet the movie shies away from acknowledging her lifestyle as unhealthy. Additionally, an extended and somewhat unrelated flashback sequence in the midst of the climax leaves the ending feeling slightly incomplete.\n\nDespite a couple of shortcomings, Nikuko-chan's conclusion re-contextualises the snippets of Nikuko and Kiku's lives that we witness throughout the hour and half to be something meaningful beyond the sum of their parts.",

The two seasons also present a more in-depth look at the Empire while expanding on already established characters. The introduction of the planet Fezzan adds a new perspective to the intergalactic war, and the show does a strong job balancing the ideologies and wants of the three nations as well as the conflicting feelings of the people who live in them through engaging dialogue supported by excellent voice acting. \n\nThe battle scenes, on the other hand, were a mixed bag, as the three-dimensional nature of space is not always used effectively and some battles are not as engaging as others. Still, the strategic prowess displayed from multiple parties makes the battles enjoyable.\n\nWith rock-solid sequels to a character-driven and politically charged space drama, *Die Neue These* aptly builds on elements from its previous seasons and presents a deeply satisfying continuation.",

The film dives into the next chapter in the stage girls' story and explores how change impacts their relationships\n\nKaren and Hikari's relationship serves as the crux of the film with the former reaching rock bottom and needing to be built back up as a person. A variety of poignant flashbacks are used to recontextualise their relationship, to great effect. The other pairings all get their fair share of development as well, whether it's Maya's arrogance versus Claudine's desire to be seen as an equal rival or whether it's Kaoruko and Futaba's somewhat messy and toxic relationship. Everyone has their moment in the spotlight. \n\nEvery aspect of the film's production takes full advantage of the medium, providing one of the most complete experiences in anime. The unique set pieces and their impeccable boarding are in perfect harmony with the crisp animation during the revues and the attention to detail put into the sound design. The soundtrack is a joy to listen to, and each of the different inserts tie into the revues both lyrically and musically setting up the perfect product. \n\nAn excellent film on all fronts and one that will surely be remembered for years to come, it makes perfect sense for *Revue Starlight: The Movie* to take home the victory.",

          "writeup": "*AoAshi* lives up to its seinen tag with its mature depiction of the trials and tribulations of competitive soccer. The show never downplays the sacrifices Ashito makes or the unjustified hostility he endures to follow his dreams. Improvement has to be earned through hard work, and trust through performance. Ashito's moments of frustration and elation are presented front and center in the story of his growth, with his shortcomings and eventual learnings clearly illustrated by the show's approach to the matches.\n\nThe anime presents a strong vision of soccer as a game of strategy, sacrificing some of the exhilaration of the fast-paced sport in favor of meticulous detail regarding tactics and coordinated plays. The contrast between the anime's emphasis on teamwork and Ashito's single-mindedness regarding scoring goals becomes an intriguing source of development. Over-reliance on still shots is made up for by the focus on explaining exactly what's happening on the field, which makes the action easy to follow.\n\nThe supporting cast aren't neglected in the slightest, and Ashito's teammates are particularly fleshed out with well realized personalities and mindsets. Unrest often arises thanks to these clashing viewpoints, with mutual compromise paving the way towards resolutions.\n\nCombining a focus on the strategic aspect of soccer with themes of camaraderie, *AoAshi* showcases tangible effects of the cast's interactions through the matches, and presents a cohesive and engaging narrative with an astonishing amount of soul.",

While this installment does less to advance the story's central narrative than might be expected and feels more like set-up for the future, this season does a great job of giving depth to *Vanitas*' memorable cast of characters and connecting their individual stories together.\n\nVanitas himself remains the show's lynchpin, brought to life by Hanae Natsuki's charismatic performance, and his complex partnership with Noe and simmering romance with Jeanne are captivating as ever. The entire cast gets moments to shine, and Dominique in particular gets some long-deserved focus, which pays off handsomely.\n\nThe high production value of the show remains a highlight. *Vanitas*'s aesthetic is characterized by detailed and fantastical settings, vivid colors, and a steady stream of dramatic shots and visual effects. This is all complimented wonderfully by Yuki Kajiura's beautiful, moody soundtrack.\n\nOne aspect of the show that doesn't work as well is its over-reliance on flashbacks and tragedy to facilitate character development. Constant shifting back and forth between flashbacks and real-time action hurts pacing, and the sheer weight of the tragedy in the characters' backstories can be overwhelming.\n\nAll that being said, *Vanitas no Carte Part 2* uses its strong cast and unique aesthetic to great effect, delivering a captivating work that is equal parts charming and harrowing.",

Myne remains as endearing a protagonist as ever, surrounded by a charming cast of friends and allies. Myne's close relationship with her family, and the role it plays in the season, stands out in particular. \n\nThis season's narrative is a mixed bag. The overarching conflict centers around Myne being in danger due to her own exceptionalism and facing consequences for demonstrating power and ability—a refreshing take for an isekai. On the other hand, antagonists like the High Priest are one-dimensional and cartoonishly evil just for the sake of it, and the way the season's conflicts were resolved was both confusing and unsatisfying. \n\nWhile the show's colorful, cheerful aesthetic cuts an interesting contrast to the dark reality of its society, the overall production leaves much to be desired. For a fantasy world, it fails to evoke much of a sense of wonder with its limited animation and plain backgrounds and environments. Outside of the playful chibi sections, it struggles to keep the viewer visually engaged.\n\n*Honzuki no Gekokujou* maintains much of the same charm that endeared it to its fans previously, but frustrating weaknesses in its narrative execution and production ultimately hold it back.",

Even among this stacked field of nominees, a perennial heavyweight in *Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai* separated itself from all challengers, exhibiting undeniable quality in all areas of storytelling and production to claim the title of Best Romance in a year that truly was… *Ultra Romantic*.

          "writeup": "A single animated episode in a wider anthology series, *Modern Love Tokyo* #7 tugs at one's heartstrings with its brilliant direction working in tandem with its narrative to convey a plethora of emotions from loneliness to nostalgia and hope. \n\nWith little dialogue, the physical movements of the characters convey the bulk of the narrative instead. Its use of live-action camerawork with shallow depth of field and chromatic aberration during flashbacks deliver a strong sense of nostalgia. Coupled with its storyboards cutting between the past and present as Tamami reminisces on her regrets, the full weight of her loneliness becomes apparent. \n\nIts clean sound design emphasizes the diegetic ambiance as silence permeates moments of vulnerability which allows the chirping of birds in the background or the shuffling of feet to stand out. This adds a great sense of intimacy to many scenes, while the upbeat music played during Tamami's decision to take that risk for something she loves leaves the entire work with a hopeful feeling.\n\nBeing just one episode is both a strength and weakness. It tells a focused standalone story, but also feels ephemeral compared to its peers that had a chance to deliver similar highs more frequently. Overall though, *Modern Love Tokyo* #7 expresses its themes of love for passions, people, and oneself through its effective direction and sound design that convey feelings of loneliness and nostalgia in adulthood, as well as the joy of reconnecting with what was once lost.",

From pretending to be a tengu to hide one's gender in a hot spring, to fighting off castration aliens with a condom focused magical girl. Even if ecchi humor is usually quite off-putting, the sheer creativeness and absurdity put on display makes for an entertaining watch. \n\nWhat really sets *Renai Flops* apart however, is when everything is flipped on its head and recontextualised, going from a comedic harem to a tragedy brought about by a desire to escape reality. Using a genre that is typically associated with being a wish-fulfillment fantasy, and turning it into a story about facing tragedy head-on makes the subversion of *Renai Flops* all the more impactful.\n\nUnfortunately the creativity behind the humor or the script of *Renai Flops* doesn't carry over to its production. In a category where most of the competition is knocking it out of the park, the production in *Renai Flops* doesn't stand out in any meaningful capacity.  \n\nIn the end, *Renai Flops* is not a self insert fantasy, but is instead a deeply personal journey about moving on. *Renai Flops* is a show that is hard to talk about or appreciate until completion, but it more than leaves a lasting impact.",

With an early confession from Sasaki, *Sasaki to Miyano* sets itself up to be a story with a focus on Miyano figuring out how he really feels about Sasaki as they continue to bond with one another.\n\nMiyano slowly but surely questioning his feelings and his sexuality is endearing, as is Sasaki being patient with him despite having a hard time waiting for an answer himself. While there is a lack of particular standout moments, it is more than made up for by keeping progression constant and noticeable the entire time. The series goes the entire way from friends to lovers, through that touchingly awkward and worryingly uncertain middle ground. In exchange for having more obvious turning points, *Sasaki to Miyano* focuses on telling a more grounded story. By the end of its run, *Sasaki to Miyano* comes together to form one of the most relatable and personal stories of the entire year. \n\nThere are some noticeable issues with the presentation however, such as rather stiff animation and inconsistent proportions for the show's entire runtime. The animation issues combined with the slow nature of the show can make it hard to get into for those who aren't immediately interested. Despite these initial shortcomings, *Sasaki to Miyano* is a very enjoyable time for those seeking a more grounded romantic experience.",

Anzu embodies the role of Anti-Heroine to the fullest, with her eccentric, energetic and infectious personality leaving a lasting impression that rivals the other female leads in the category like Marin Kitagawa and Kaguya Shinomiya. \n\nThe show follows Anzu after her life has been transformed into one akin to the reverse harem dating sim she plays, and the only way for her to turn her life back to normal is to fall in love with one of the men that start showing up in her life. Her headstrong rejection of a forced romance leads to constant escalation by the magician Riri, which moves the story at a quick and engaging pace that rarely slows downs. When it does, the show takes its time in creating genuine and sweet character moments that deepen its characters and their relationships, with the last arc in particular being a prime example of this.\n\nWhile Anzu is the shining star of the show, the same can't be said for the rest of the cast. The male characters are little more than established tropes from the reverse harem genre that lack meaningful character development, with Tsukasa being the only exception. Anzu's best friend is also given little time to participate in the show's antics and is sadly cast by the wayside.

With an established couple from the outset involving individuals from opposing institutions, it leans into its sentai parody and Romeo and Juliet situation to tell many fun, silly, and interesting stories. But, it's Desumi and Fudo's characters that makes this show shine. Desumi's adorable personality beneath her evil facade and Fudo's simple-minded thinking makes for many hilarious yet endearing moments. \n\nHowever, its unique premise isn't utilized fully as most scenes occur within Gekko's dorms and headquarters which makes it easy to forget that this is a Sentai show. While it has its characters using their powers within these settings, it often ends up merely acting as the context for otherwise regular romance scenes. Coupled with the lack of focus on Team Gelato, it's easy to forget that *Koiseka* has something special in its premise for us.\n\nTwo of Gelato's members do get explored, but it pales in comparison to Gekko's princesses. The latter's interactions with each other deliver hilarious moments which inspire Desumi while building on the absurdity of Gekko as an organization while the former do little to expand on Team Gelato besides adding humor \n\nWhile *Koiseka*'s lack of commitment due to its variety lessens its highs compared to its competitors, its ability to deliver fun and refreshing moments consistently makes it a worthy nomination.",

The requirement to fall in love to become a vampire forces both characters to do some self-discovery, and they begin to care for one another rather than focus on their original desires. Their romance doesn't resonate with everyone however, as their age gap is a sticking point for some. Kou's youth is an important part of his character and innocence compared to those around him, but that doesn't change the discrepancy in years between them. \n\nIts wide cast is another stand-out element, with each of the characters Kou interacts with bringing something to the table. Each of the vampire characters tackle a unique aspect of what eternal life would be like enticing Kou to join their ranks. While the human characters pull Kou in the opposite direction, such as when he meets a vampire hunter who confronts his idealistic desire with grim reality.  \n\n*Yofukashi no Uta's* fantastic atmospheric presence, strong cast and endearing sense of discovery deliver a beautiful romantic journey into the night.",

Their relationship isn't defined by their social hierarchies, leaving room for honest interactions and a genuine friendship to develop. Misunderstandings are resolved at the moment, giving the characters the chance to develop and progress naturally. The show explores themes of beauty, authenticity, and friendship through these interactions, the hina art, and the cosplay.\n\nThe creative staff took care in bringing the characters to life by altering their appearance when cosplaying and giving various outfits beyond the school uniform. The art style differences can be seen through the hina dolls, which are drawn in a finer style with a thinner outline, the characters eyes, which change style between cosplay, and the animation style of the in-show games/anime. Lastly, the color pallet is vibrant and bold, giving a cheerful and calming feeling throughout the watch.\n\nThere are still seinen romance clichés present such as body shots, ecchi gags, and sexualization of underage characters. Also, compared to other shows in the category, no specific scene leaves a lasting impact as the peaks aren't that high or unique. Beyond the flaws, *Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru* was still enjoyable to watch and the animation and character interactions were enough for a nomination.",

          "writeup": "The *Kaguya-sama* series is no stranger to these awards, and it continues its dominance over the romantic comedy genre, building on all that's come before to offer up its finest installment to date in *Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Ultra Romantic*.\n \nThe cast and their chemistry together remain superb, featuring an abundance of strong group dynamics, compelling one-on-one relationships, and an expansive supporting cast that make Shuchiin Academy come to life. The relationship between Kaguya and Shirogane particularly shines, as their personalities and insecurities are explored in greater depth, re-contextualizing their ‘War of Love' as something much more compelling than a mere power struggle. Among the supporting cast, Hayasaka and Ishigami have well-developed personal arcs, while Chika and Maki are bountiful sources of entertaining jokes and gags. The narrative is meticulously structured, seamlessly weaving all the characters' individual arcs, relationships, and activities together to keep events fresh and unpredictable.\n \nThe creative staff behind *Ultra Romantic* take full advantage of anime as a medium in its production. It's well animated, and packs each skit and scene to the brim with visual and audio gags, memorable cinematic frames, and pop culture references. The voice actors all do a fantastic job, bringing their characters to life in delivering the show's sharp, fast-paced dialogue.\n \nBetween its engaging cast of characters, intelligent storytelling, and standout production, *Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Ultra Romantic* blends the series' comedic and romantic elements together better than ever, delivering an experience that is both hilarious and heartfelt.",

Many didn't quite make it that were nonetheless quite successful in their own right. The uniquely surrealist *Pop Team Epic Season 2*, the ill-fated *Isekai Oji-san*, the endearingly stop-motion *Pui Pui Molcar S2*, and the 2022 premier Ecchi show *Futoku no Guild* all impressed, but weren’t able to get one of the few nominations.    In a year where far more than ten shows managed to be entertaining, high quality, and unique, what made the chosen nominees stand out are thorough, compelling character dynamics. Specifically the ways that the shows were able to tell a meaningful story about the different sorts of positive, impactful relationships we can have with each other. These relationships took many forms, from the found family narratives in Spy x Family and Akiba Maid War, to the deep friendships at heart in Machikado and Bocchi the Rock, to the literal family connecting it all in Chimimo. Humorous though they all are, it was the top nominees, the headliners of the comedy shows who set up the punchline for these compelling stories of meaningful relationships.",

          "writeup": "*Chimimo*'s bright pastel colors and bold outlines give the show a pleasant and distinct visual identity, elevated through strong use of traditional Japanese instruments accompanied by simple and cute sound design. It didn't take long to fall for the heartwarming found family between Jigoku-san and the Onigami sisters, as well as the Chimimoryo spirits' marshmallow-like bodies enhancing their cartoony shenanigans.\nThe comedy is centered around validating the little personal hells of everyday life, where the issues may seem small like the Chimimoryo from an outsider's perspective, but can be a real pain-in-the-butt to experience first-hand. The cast effectively tackle a wide range of relatable events based on their age and life-situation. Jigoku-san showcases the struggles of foreigners working abroad, confused about the culture and customs of modern Japan, while failing to meet the expectations of his boss to create hell on earth. Mei's pressure from social media was also explored competently, connecting with the younger viewers. Mutsumi had an important role of carrying the pressure of adult responsibilities at work and home, but was sadly a bit underutilized compared to the other sisters. Hazuki is a positive standout; though she's a drunkard and constantly engaging in money-making schemes to fund her next dopamine high, she's still a source of infectious joy to those around her.\nDue to the crudeness of certain sketches taking away from its pleasant atmosphere, and its minimalism at times leaving something to be desired, it falls a bit short to its contemporaries. However, its strongly themed relatable comedy and found-family aspects still made this hidden gem something special.",

          "writeup": "*Love Live! Superstar!* picks up where the first season left off with the idol group Liella continuing with their goal of achieving victory at the Love Live. \n\nThe already strong cast were greeted with a new cohort of students to join the idol club, each with their own funny personality quirks that left lasting impressions. Whilst not as impressive as some of the original Liella members, the dynamic the new cast members offered were worthwhile with the differing skill levels between the respective generations forming the crux of the dramatic beats. Sumire and Keke's bickering continued to be a highlight with their comedic chemistry whilst also growing as a pair as a result of the main conflict.   \n\nThe performances were pretty inconsistent. Liellla's concerts weren't as well choreographed and the songs lost some of the charm that made them unique compared to their predecessors. The show makes up for this with Margarete's breathtaking concerts, which are standouts not just in the season but in the entire *Love Live* franchise. \n\nThe pacing of the ending left a lot to be desired and some of the developments felt unnecessary, but the loveable cast and well realized character interactions made the overall experience still worthy of a nomination.

Additionally, it shines in even the more mundane episodes, with vibrant background art as well as using cartoony character expressions and sound effects to enhance the comedy.\nWhen not focused on comedy, the main plot of S2 largely revolves around Karyl and her relationship with the guild versus the rest of the cast. The overarching plot feels weak and drags out, especially near the end, hurting the show even more as it could have used that time to flesh out a sub-par main villain or a few of its numerous sides (possibly too numerous). Karyl's emotional climaxes stand out amidst this though, providing some wholesome moments between her and the Guild and doing a lot to improve her as a character. These combined with some solid character-of-the-week comedy in the first half bring S2 to what can be considered an overall success of a sequel.",

New cast members such as Lico and Manager Shirosawa add new interactions and shake up some of the comedy. Mikan gets thrown into the limelight and has her backstory explored. These moments of character development are aided by the main cast providing support to each other and showcasing the strength of having others help one another. This season's robust thematic backbone of protecting and helping everyone, demon and magical girl alike fosters the heartwarming spirit of the show and provides for emotionally resonant moments. \n\n*Machikado* features clever usage of its art style and sound design. Quick and pointed animation communicates the energy of the show with fast-paced humor. The sound effects being both audibly and textually communicated boosts the show's lightheartedness and comedy. While Machikado had effective comedic beats and compelling character development, it struggled with its pacing. The final arc was a let down when compared to the mid-season finale and left the series feeling somewhat incomplete. While its fast paced nature works great for its comedy, sometimes it can hurt the flow of the more emotional scenes  *Machikado Mazoku: 2-Choume* is an excellent addition to the franchise that expands on the promise and strengths of the first season.",

          "writeup": "Maids being gangsters in a gruesome, underground, yakuza-inspired battle for dominance is a premise that nobody expected, but impresses out of the gate. The outrageous premise is bolstered by how the show commits to it. The first episode sets the tone by juxtaposing bloody messes over the happy entertainment provided by the industry. Comical over-the-top parody scenarios highlight dark comedy that keeps things fresh and original. It's a world where the characters simply accept that this is how things operate; removing rivals and competition for the most petty reasons is fair game.\n\nAs the show expands to focus on the big picture of the war itself, the characters themselves leave much to be desired in terms of camaraderie and chemistry. It feels as though the maids of Oinky Doink were loyal co-workers rather than close friends, and the apparent lack of true bonding prevents them from being more likable than those in other nominated shows. Much of the supporting cast feels underutilized and doesn't make an impact outside of their focus episodes.\n\nWhile the violent nature of the show and its insistence on the war's overall progression over character development may be divisive, its originality and dark comedy raised enough attention to earn a nomination.",

          "writeup": "*Ya Boi Kongming* was an unexpected hit, highlighted by a great main duo turning a silly premise into something both amusing and endearing.\nKongming himself carries most of the comedic weight, confounded by the marvels of the modern world and reusing two-thousand year old battle tactics to win over the crowd at a nightclub. He also provides motivation and a steady hand for the other main, Eiko. In addition to playing the straight man to Kongming's shenanigans, she drives the plot forward with her dream of becoming a musician. The positive but not overconfident energy that she carries makes it hard not to root for her, bolstered by the fact that the musical talent behind her is quite solid (even if they use the same songs a bit too often).\nHowever, the show runs into some problems in the second half as it goes to explore some other side characters. Kabe's arc dragged on a bit too long, while the Azalea arc seemed to abandon a lot of what made the show stand out previously. Kongming is relegated to mostly a background character as it moves to a more dramatic tone, and while the criticisms it has on music production companies are valid, it goes too far on them with some cartoonishly evil industry members. Both arcs had their highlights such as the Kabe/Kongming rap battle and some heart-to-heart between Kuon/Eiko, but they still were a step down and ultimately kept *Kongming* from a higher placement.",

          "writeup": "*Spy x Family* starts off on a very strong note, establishing an endearing 3-way ‘found family' dynamic that the entire show revolves around. The heartwarming moments between the Forgers are what made the Forgers stand out as a family, such as seeing Lloyd make an effort to learn how to be a better parent or when Anya pushes herself to do a good job in the exams for the sake of the mission. Lloyd is adorably protective of Anya, who in turn loves her awesome spy dad. Yor is a big softie for Anya, who starts off scared of her but for whom the affection is deeply meaningful. Lloyd and Yor have the classic ‘marriage of convenience' but they end up being surprisingly compatible which makes their later romance more believable.\nThe Big Band soundtrack compliments the show with its alternatively jazzy and high energy vibe, layering the show by framing the otherwise mundane, everyday activities of a family as humorously intense. Anya's secret mind reading powers are well utilized in the story. Anya generally remains the star of the show, consistently having the funniest skits, particularly later on once the relationship between Anya and Damien is established. The beginning of the show creates a captivating family dynamic compared to the status quo that is established by Season 2, where much less emphasis is placed on developing relationships and character growth and as a result the show felt somewhat engaging as a result. Nonetheless, with its standout soundtrack and well-executed plot elements the show succeeds at creating a memorable and engaging ‘found family' dynamic.",

Despite her condition being core to the show's comedy, it remains relatable as it feels like the audience is laughing with Hitori rather than at her.\n\nThe comedy is not carried by Hitori alone. She is joined by an entertaining side cast throughout the story with contrasting personalities and good chemistry with one another. Their interactions with Hitori's anxiety are positive; rather than trying to force her to change, the band accepts her in her current state while still being supportive of her efforts to break out of her shell at her own pace. Hitori being the center of the story means less spotlight for the other characters, resulting in the rest of the cast leaving less of an impression, but they are still a positive presence in her development. \n\nThe visual strengths of the show enhances the delivery of jokes. The consistent and expressive character animation and creative use of mixed media to highlight Hitori's emotions in her fantasies provide variety to the jokes while furthering themes of social anxiety. Be it melting when put on the spot, being ‘trapped' in a game of life where the choices don't matter, or seeing herself as a monster, the visual direction of this adaptation is nothing short of amazing. The journey of Hitori and Kessoku Band is hysterical, filled with good music and technical prowess, and tells a relatable, heartwarming story that captivates the audience. ",

The mascots introduced in this season, which for the most part felt like unnecessary and ear-grating additions to the cast, didn't develop much as characters, and took away focus from more well-liked characters and their performances. The formulaic nature of the show was also splitting, with the repetitiveness of running gags and performances as well as references to earlier entries to the Pretty series mostly appealing to long-time fans instead of a general audience.\n\nWhile the divisiveness of *Kiratto Pri-chan* holds it back from being for everyone, the strong new music performances and light-hearted, cheery atmosphere is well worth it for those that make it this far into the series.",

Along with these ideas, questions about what makes art special and the merits of technology versus magic are raised especially when it comes to Matsuri and Auru. *Waccha PriMagi* balances these ideas well between the different members of the cast and expands on them throughout its episodes.\n\nThat said, while the long runtime helps tackle these issues multiple times it does mean that the best parts of the show can be somewhat spread out as the time isn't utilized the best. The production is also mixed. The songs are generally strong, but  each performer only having one song means that the songs can get repetitive after a while.

In particular, Aika and Akira receive the bulk of the screen time, with their relationship serving as the core of the narrative. \n\nHard work serves as the main foundation of their relationship, with both progressing through the undine world as a result of hours of work put in to overcome the gap in skill between them and other undines. Watching Akira go about her career is originally what inspired Aika to become an amazing undine, and this film plays on this relationship to show that Akira was similarly inspired by Aika when both were younger. This multifaceted relationship is what makes the film so special, and the depiction of how both of the girls continue to inspire and push the other onwards through healthy rivalry is really well executed. \n\nThe character designs do a great job at depicting the characters as they have aged, with their more angular features giving off a mature feeling. The backgrounds breathe life into Neo Venezia and set the atmosphere through the usage of beautiful night skies. The buildings are full of character through the usage of a variety of different shapes and sizes, creating a city  that feels lived in. \n\n*ARIA the BENEDIZIONE* is the perfect finale to a beloved franchise, expertly tackling themes of effort vs talent, the passing of the torch from generation to generation, and never giving up on your dreams.

The vibrant colors of backgrounds and lively music create comfy and warm natural environments that are a treat during the mountain climbing segments. Its animation style, focused on minimizing the amount of detail on models to emphasize character movement, shows how effectively emotion can be transmitted without dialogue or facial expressions, not to forget how goofy the style can be for comedic expressivity.\nCharacteristic of a slice of life story, there are many other individual adventures that happen on the road to the finale. It'd have worked better to have the new content be more focused on the preparation for the second ascension of Mount Fuji, but these episodic skits were still decent on their own. With so many new interactions between characters, funny and emotional moments, and the payoff of a long journey, *Yama no Susume* made for one of the better slice of life experiences of the year.",

          "writeup": "*Deaimon* is a gentle, relaxed Slice of Life story centering on an adopted/found family relationship coming together in a traditional Japanese sweets shop. The show's warm, watercolor art style breathes feeling into the backgrounds in a way that's perfect for the relaxed pace and atmosphere of the show. Watching the two leads develop the somewhat odd, strained relationship at the start into a genuinely supportive, caring one by the end is a heartwarming tale, especially when watching the standoffish and overly critical Itsuka grow into a less suspicious, more age-appropriately childlike personality.\nHowever, the show is weighed down by a number of issues. The art style, while very fitting and beautiful, animates stiffly, and while the relationship of the main leads is the show's strong core, the character of Nagomu himself isn't all too compelling outside of that context. While the supporting cast is varied and receives adequate attention, their lack of individually compelling traits along with a tiring tendency for many of them to nag or berate Nagomu for seemingly inconsequential things leaves them feeling insufficient to the task of carrying the rest of the show. And, above all else, *Deaimon* lacks any standout, unqualified strengths to distinguish it in a year of stacked competitors for the genre.\nAll that said, *Deaimon* undoubtedly succeeds at what it set out to do, and the simultaneous novelty and skill on display makes the show an enjoyable affair and worthwhile time even despite its flaws.",

          "writeup": "A slice of life fan favorite, *Yuru Camp* returns to the awards in surprisingly different fashion: the characters are older and leading professional lives. Instead of a carefree, relaxed time of high school friends enjoying the outdoors, *Yuru Camp Movie* is an exploration of maintaining distant friendships, a discovery of the changes of adulthood, and a journey to find new purpose in old hobbies. A highlight is the seamless and natural dialogue that pervades the film, adding familiarity, maturity, and meaning to every conversation. Add onto that outstanding music and voice acting and you get a movie that sounds even better than it looks.\n\nUnfortunately, in chasing these new themes, the movie has shifted from what the TV anime is known for. The addition of conflict and drama is disorienting for a series devoid of it to date, and the forced nature of the resolution makes it feel unnecessary or ill-planned. The movie aims to be relatable to a specific audience group of young professionals living away from home; for viewers who have not experienced this struggle, the movie falls flat and its merit is diminished. On a technical note, the visuals of the movie are unchanged from the TV series, disappointing considering the larger budget and more focused development that anime movies often have.\n\nThe *Yuru Camp Movie* is a bold attempt to take the series to new and unexplored territory. While not everyone appreciated the attempt, it's an exciting and refreshing look that still delivers a comfy time.",

Having drifted apart from her childhood friend, the protagonist Yua Serufu is introduced into the world of *DIY* handcrafting.\nThroughout the series Serufu explores her new passion, gaining new friends and reconnecting with her old friend Purin. Although it took its time to reach its climax, the reconciliation of Serufu and Purin was endearing to see develop, and emphasized the power of bonding through a shared hobby as intimate as *DIY*. Serufu's carefree nature and Purin's pouting never got old, and in terms of side characters, Jobko's smugness and her ‘engrish' shticks were funny highlights. Despite the other characters leaving less of an impression, they still added their unique flavor to their scenes, like Kokoro's zany antics or Rei's chill and controlled attitude to her work.\nThe production quality was one of the show's biggest standouts as it used its visuals to perfectly capture an engaging atmosphere. The backgrounds reminiscent of a handcrafted painting, Purin's adorable facial expressions, how the energetic movements of Jobko and Kokoro feel akin to their personalities, and the art style in Serufu's fantasies feel like opening a children's picture book.\nDespite its plot being nothing revolutionary, it was still a captivating anime thanks to its laid back cast and technical aspects that all work in harmony to create a soothing and beautiful experience.",

Beautifully animated and well-written, the show goes the extra mile to capture breathtaking moments and dig deep into the thoughts and emotions of the cast.\n\nThe show starts off on a strong note with Akebi's dilemma of having the wrong school uniform custom made, and is representative of how relatable and poignant the storytelling is throughout the show. The show ends with a finale that both showcases the progression and growth of the cast as well as presents an uplifting conclusion to the strong themes of the show. In between and throughout, *Akebi's Sailor Uniform* features beautiful animation and painted stills that overflow with artistry, giving the show distinct identity. The soundtrack and voice acting are also standout features, resulting in a polished, high-quality production that does not fail to impress.\n\nNot everything is as sunny as Akebi's personality, however. The show portrays its characters in detailed intimacy which can feel uncomfortably voyeuristic. The large cast means some characters are under-utilized, and apart from episode 1, Akebi's role in the show is largely that of a perfect Mary Sue type of character. Despite this, the show's powerful and emotional highs easily shine through and make this show a memorable and worthwhile experience.",

While the shortlisting process went by mostly without incident, there were some notable shows that were a surprise in not making the final nominee cut, like *Kyoukyuu no Karasu* and *Chikyuugai Shounon Shoujo*. Unsurprisingly, once the final public and jury nominees were decided, with this variety of show types and jurors with equally varying tastes, there weren’t any clear front runners to take the gold. As discussion barreled towards the finale, conversations turned to ever-more specific topics and particularities as, with the entries being as strong as they are, the rankings hinged on issues that might never have come up in other years, such as the execution of CGI or the relative effectiveness of OSTs in specific important scenes.  As a result, the ultimate rankings were unknown until the final vote was cast… And what could be more Suspenseful than that?",

This movie continues the fun of mashing Cute Girls Doing Cute Things with *James Bond*-style spy antics in a steampunk Cold War setting. The series's strong focus on production continues in this entry, with dynamic action sequences and good incorporation of CGI elements in the movie. In addition, *Crown Handler 2*'s story is paced perfectly; events don't pass by so quickly that viewers are confused about what's happening, but neither do they feel drawn-out or boring.\n\nUnfortunately, its faults are similarly apparent—judged as an individual entry, the plot of *Crown Handler 2* fails to garner much emotional investment. While both movie installments set up the mystery of the overall arc, the first movie *also* tells a standalone story. In contrast, this entry appears to only set up elements and plot points for later installments. The events of this movie feel akin to filler. Even if the threats to the characters and world are supposedly real and the consequences weighty, the narrative doesn't treat them as such. When the entire *Crown Handler* arc is completed, perhaps these issues will be less noticeable. But as an individual entry, they're only too apparent.\n\nUltimately, however, *Princess Principal: Crown Handler 2* is a compelling reminder that “suspense stories” need not always be told with a priority on serious tone over entertainment value; a well-executed story can be suspenseful *and* fun.",

          "writeup": "*Yojouhan Time Machine Blues* is a unique entry in that it shows an endearing cast of college students fooling around while laying the groundwork for a subtle romance story among the cast. It would seem like a simple romantic comedy if it weren't for the added time-travel twist. And it's this added feature that allows for various hilarious outcomes, as the characters set out to avoid creating a paradox by undoing whatever changes their foolish buddies did when they traveled to the past. This premise not only delivers good jokes, but also establishes a sense of mystery—what new twist might lie ahead in the next episode?\n\nHowever, despite unique character design, creative use of color palettes, and engaging dialogues, *Time Machine Blues* feels lacking compared to the other nominations, as these elements don't necessarily compensate for a rather static setting: characters talking in a hallway. Another aspect to highlight is the style of storytelling. The story keeps the viewer interested with visual cues, but the excessive dialogue may put off some, as it can feel like a reading marathon for those not used to such a fast pace. \n\nOverall, even with the bizarre yet interesting twists, this is still the story of a group of friends that just wanted to record an indie movie in their backyard. If the goal is just to relax and watch the fun unfold, *Time Machine Blues* is a great choice.",

          "writeup": "This season of *Shadows House* does a great job of building the mystery and suspense of the first. A strong aspect of the show is how it balances light and heavy tones. The mystery pairs well with the setting, and there's an impressively diverse cast of characters. Each one has their own color, personality, and design that incorporate symbolism such as flowers. For instance, Kate is red to signify her passionate personality, while Shaun is blue to denote his calm demeanor.\n\nOne critique of the show is that the mystery and reveal are predictable, mainly because the show's ending and opening songs give away too much about the culprit. Certain characters also don't see as much screen time this season, which is a shame. There's a larger cast this season so as to shift the focus to figuring out who is behind creating more enemies. Unfortunately, with so many new characters, the main cast fades a little into the background, specifically anyone that isn't Kate. \n\nThis season also has some fairly great production and animation. There's an impressive amount of attention to detail, care, and consideration put into it. The soundtrack also is on point, it fits the series. It's atmospheric and really well suited to a story set in a mansion. \n\n*Shadow's House* is building a story worth following. On top of its mystery and fleshed-out characters, it deserves praise for the way its setting and story are so unique.",

The production quality is a notable strength, potentially among the strongest here when solely considering the synthesis of the audiovisual aspects. This is noticeable during both the engaging action sequences and the slice-of-life moments that pay careful attention to developing the show's atmosphere. *Lycoris Recoil* also features standout voice acting performances among Suspense nominees, with Matsuoka Yoshitsugu's Majima and Anzai Chika's Chisato being well-realized.\n\nHowever, the hybrid slice-of-life/suspense nature of the story ultimately proves to be a double-edged sword. While the daily life aspects are enjoyable and keep the overall show light, the shifts from those scenes to action are sometimes jarring. The lighter mood can sometimes feel like it's undercutting the serious topics and events that comprise the main plot. In addition, how normalcy is restored after the events of the finale breaks the suspension of disbelief. It makes an otherwise satisfying happy ending feel forced as if realism was forgone so as not to ruin the lighter tone of the show.\n\nAll that said, the ridiculous premise, over-the-top action, and heartwarming character interactions still make *Lycoris Recoil* a highly enjoyable show worth checking out, especially for fans of suspense that might enjoy a side of slice-of-life or for those in search of strong character-centric stories.

The world-building plays well off this situation with the introduction of a new group of explorers as the abyss's atmosphere becomes more vast and dangerous.\n\nAlthough *Made in Abyss*'s use of gore and other uncomfortable elements may be too much for some, it intensifies the harrowing conditions and encounters the cast face in the Abyss. The show tells a unique story amidst all the pain.\n\nRegarding art direction, the unique style present in season one carries over here. The rich and detailed backgrounds beautifully illustrate the varying environments in the Abyss. Some CGI elements awkwardly stand out from the 2D animation, but the rest of the production is solid. In addition, the OST remains stellar. It embodies the Abyss's mysterious nature, emphasizes the cast's interactions in unknown territory, and complements the dramatic or emotional encounters throughout the journey. The track during the moment where Faputa confides in Reg that she felt left alone is a good example.\n\nWith the continued descent into the Abyss, the second season marks a significant development in the story through its impressive overall production quality, compelling character interactions, and careful handling of weighty themes.",

Its newest entry expands on the topics of war, racism, violence, and moral ambiguity introduced in the first part while bringing about new conflicts and tying together mysterious plot points into a satisfying and exciting revelation. *Season 4 Part 2* continues to juggle its expanding cast of characters and show how the harrowing situations around them challenge their beliefs and mindsets through tense interpersonal moments and energetic action scenes.\n\nEren's development is especially impressive. In true protagonist fashion, Eren drives the story forward, and his controversial actions allow the audience to see the fallout of these choices and how it impacts the world around him. How his past experiences contribute to the extreme decisions he makes in the current season is explored well, and it feels like the culmination of four seasons of buildup. \n\nWhile Eren receives a good amount of focus this season, the much smaller presence of other prominent characters from previous seasons, particularly Mikasa and Armin, raises the question of whether the focus of characters was adequately distributed. The production quality falters in certain areas as well. While the overall visuals and fight animation are impressive, the CGI integration feels jarring in a few scenes, and the OST is sometimes underwhelming.

          "writeup": "*Summer Time Render*'s most appealing aspect is its strong and captivating start. While murder mystery stories aren't a new concept, the show's plot structure creates a strong sense of mystery and suspense that builds up along the way. The beginning bolsters a dark, harrowing setting and reveals information in a manner that makes it exciting to attempt to piece together the clues along with the rest of the characters. With many surprising twists, a high-stakes conflict, and mysterious antagonists that offer the main cast a vigorous challenge, the first cour keeps its viewers on their toes.\n\nDespite its strong beginning, the second half feels lackluster in comparison. The show's tonal shift from the initial mysterious atmosphere to a more action-oriented one feels too far off from the show's opening mood. Sudden, new plot developments coupled with unclear character decisions also cause the second cour to feel less engaging.\n\nProduction-wise, however, the visuals are capable and consistent and pair well with the deliberate sound design of the show. It adds a creepy and ominous atmosphere, matching the tone of the show. A moment in episode 12 exemplifying this is when the characters face one of the main antagonists for the first time. The sound of dripping water and a whistling, unsettling wind surrounds them, which adds a feeling of apprehension to an already tense encounter. Although *Summer Time Render* has weaknesses, the show's solid production and thrilling first half carry the momentum to make the series a worthwhile watch overall.",

          "writeup": "*Cyberpunk Edgerunners* stood out both as a visually astonishing, action-packed anime, and as a bleak, bittersweet story. It is set within a futuristic yet decadent and downright dystopian setting, so aspects like income inequality and discrimination are a constant within the story and implicitly lay the groundwork for future events. The protagonist's main motivation early in the series is to rebel against this society in his own way, even if it's futile. In the end, they're just pawns being used in the proxy wars between megacorporations.\nIn line with the show's setting, the cast is composed of vibrant characters whose designs convey the outcast feeling of someone willing to risk their lives in their line of work. Alongside this, the show stands out by showing some of the most impressive animation sequences within the category, which are complemented with BGM that enraptures the viewer and reinforces the impact of each scene.  \nFinally, one of the show's major strengths is its portrayal of each character's emotions. It shows not only anger against a cruel society and the hopelessness that comes with a character losing their sanity, but also the sense of belonging to a group that is accepting, as well as the joy of loving the person they hold dear. Through this mix of emotions, the show stands out as the viewer shares the characters' happiness, sorrow, and yearning for a bright future that seems out of reach. ",

Transitioning from a historical separation of the “Main” and “Supporting” character categories, the Dramatic Character category this year aimed to intentionally consider nominees that weren’t necessarily the headliners of their shows. Despite this, the most captivating characters this year were those who made paths for exploring the casts of their shows and made strides in their own growth.   Questions of self-identity and the passions of nominees were critical factors for their effectiveness at connecting with the audience this year.  Discussion was centered on how nominees engage with and share experienced traumas alongside the relatability of their responses to personal circumstances. This becomes especially effective through the commonality shared between shows and their relationship-centric narratives. Chisato and Shinpei find themselves grappling with their motivations for self-sacrifice and hope but are propped up by friends new and old. Vanitas and Faputa question the importance of home, identity and purpose as they question the origins of their core beliefs. Facing hopeless futures, Yang and Boji encourage looking forward and believing in the best humanity has to offer.   The elements of voice acting, character design, soundtrack leitmotifs, dialogue, and story direction each had varying degrees of impact to the successful utilization for the nominees. The commonality of dealing with trauma brought these ideas together for all of these characters, and the way they grew in the face of it was valued in particular.",

          "writeup": "Akebi Komichi is the face of controversy, from “favorite of the decade” to a “travesty of a nomination”, she's the very definition of a “hit-or-miss” character. Manatsu Murakami skillfully maximizes the appeal of Akebi's adolescent voice through deliberately exaggerated pitch and tone variations, while it elevated her to another level for those who love her, her VA similarly enhanced the main issue surrounding her controversy, as a completely unrealistic and perfect genki-girl.\nWhile Akebi can be seen as an underdeveloped plot-device, her role as a catalyst for her classmates is undeniable. Facing everything with confidence and a smile, Akebi inspires growth and explores different facets of her classmates' insecurities and passion, creatively mirroring and contrasting with her classmates, while making a clear separation between the role of “the observer” and “the observed”. From body insecurity and viewing all human traits as equal (not just traditionally masculine or feminine traits), to isolation and weaponized individuality (presented with a sailor uniform in a sea of blazers and uniformity), a wide range of themes are explored through Akebi, with the importance of human connections as the centerpiece of her character.\nPresentation is where Akebi excelled: through her unflinchingly intimate perspective and expressive character animation, the viewer is invited to observe her with an inquisitive mind. Akebi's emotions are brilliantly conveyed through unparalleled compositional awareness and application of melodic variations.\nLove her or hate her, Akebi's role as a perfect catalyst inspiring growth in others makes her a worthy nominee.\n",

          "writeup": "*Vanitas no Carte Part 2* is a tremendous second season that introduces both new sides to the titular character as well as explores the base laid out in Part 1. In particular, Vanitas's growing relationship with Jeanne is outstanding, unveiling honest and genuine emotions in him that were unseen in the more playful and teasing dynamic between them in Part 1. Most notably, the relationship becomes complicated by his feelings about himself in the face of someone who accepts him for who he is. This denial of emotion within himself contrasted against the accepting and excited Jeanne creates a fresh dynamic very rarely executed so well in anime.\n\nRegardless of the work put into making him more accessible to the audience, Vanitas is still quite the mystery compared to other nominees, particularly regarding his motivations and the rest of the journey which made him into who he is. History and theories regarding his character that can only be speculated over still rest at the forefront, despite the beginnings of a commitment from the narrative to give him more concrete traits and details to fill in the mysteries. \n\nThe production behind him remained strong as well. His design, perfectly Victorian with a mysterious black and blue color scheme, and mannerisms, flamboyant yet always holding something back, add greatly to the mystery of his person. Along with another outstanding voice acting performance and the aforementioned exploration of his character, these are certainly enough to call him one of the best characters of 2022.\n",

          "writeup": "For 2022, no character compared to the renown held by Yang Wen-li. Hailing from the remake of a beloved series, Yang was a major point of discussion for the first time, and he made a big splash thanks to the adaptations of two major storylines. Fortress vs. Fortress was the first, in which his frustration and impatience with the government are expertly portrayed in a way that brings about refreshing struggles for a seemingly perfect man. The second, Operation Ragnarok, introduces an entirely new side to his character. Being torn from his adopted son, Julian, and shown a universe where democracy is defeated, the writing behind Yang as a duty-bound man despite his fatherly instincts is incomparable to his fellow nominees in its depth and humanity. Despite the streamlined storytelling of the remake, Yang's outstanding character remains wholly intact through his trials. \n\nFor the first time during *Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu: Die Neue These*, Yang feels like a truly relatable man. His struggles with fatherhood are extremely down to Heinessen for such a brilliant and, at times, otherworldly character. Additionally, constant strain is placed upon his morals and ethics by corrupt bureaucracy, even as he fights to protect it on the basis of freedom. The portrayal of his arrogance when cornered during his trial is superb, combined with how Yang himself is beginning to lose patience in the same scene, despite the situation being a contradiction he encourages. This outstanding writing serves as the basis for Yang's ascendance,  firmly cementing his place among other great figures in 2022.\n",

          "writeup": "*Summer Time Render*'s time-manipulating storyline has brought it wide acclaim, and this is in no small part due to Shinpei Ajiro. Throughout the emotional peaks of the show, Shinpei consistently provides the viewer with an objective, yet believable, grasp of the situation he and his friends find themselves trapped in. Despite his sole responsibility for progressing the plot, it was refreshing to have a main character that doesn't have all the answers and is forced to rely on the abilities of the people around him. \n\nDeath is a recurring plot device throughout the show and impossible for Shinpei to escape. Through moments of tension and tragedy, Shinpei is never numb to this reality, with his humanity and sanity continually being tested but holding firm. This was especially important as a point of contrast for questions surrounding humanity within the show, regarding the “shadow” cast fulfilling a primarily antagonistic role. Furthermore, Shinpei exhibits admirable bravery and compassion for his family and friends, based in his motivations to keep them safe by whatever means are required, as their lives are threatened in the apocalyptic setting. \n\n*Summer Time Render* relies heavily at times on monologues from its cast as exposition for their inner mind, and Shinpei is not an exception for this approach. The show's writing would benefit in exploring alternative writing devices as the monologuing can become tiring, but their content is nonetheless impactful for Shinpei's emotional expression throughout his challenging story.\n",

          "writeup": "The introduction of Faputa in *Made in Abyss* brought an outstanding moral conflict to a series already full of nuanced dilemmas and confrontations. She's a vengeful creature that can only view the world in black or white suddenly confronted with a morally gray reality that tests her will. Her journey from raging vagabond to guardian of her victims is a natural progression for a character who embodies childlike naivety. With a design and vocal performance befitting such a curious character, familiar cues are used to mirror her with her mother, such as the usage of \"jewels” hearkening back to Iruumyui's necklace. This intentional design gives the audience an immediate attachment as a surrogate for Irumyuui, before ever knowing Faputa herself.\n\nHer dynamics with other characters were generally strong, although Reg's amnesiac nature caused some of their interactions to fall flat. Much praise is deserved for the strong parallels between Faputa, who overcame her mother's perceived wish and became her own person, and the journey of Riko, who still follows along in the footsteps of Lyza. For Faputa, breaking free of the \"curse\" of revenge meant seeing things from a different angle. It meant learning she was not created solely from the hatred Irumyuui harbored, but also from the love hidden in her heart for Vueko, something Faputa herself was never allowed access to. This story of a child escaping the shadow of their parent, a consistent theme of *MiA*, made Faputa one of the strongest characters of 2022.\n",

          "writeup": "Boji sits firmly in the center of events in *Ousama Ranking*, to embody the themes of kindness and forgiveness encapsulated within the show's plot. Boji's merits as a dramatic character rest in his integral role in exploring the show's cast and the quietly regal confidence he exudes as he journeys to reclaim his crown. \n\nBoji is uniquely distinct as a character through his communication disabilities of muteness and deafness, yet these are not treated as drawbacks to his character. Unfortunately, later on in the show, the writing uses Kage as a direct mouthpiece for Boji, removing agency already owned by Boji finding his own voice through other means of communication. This was especially disappointing, as character design and soundtrack production elements were skillfully manipulated to provide Boji with alternate means to interact with the viewer.\n\nAs he extends his hand to the cast at large, Boji's character arc relies strongly on being the underdog deserving of support. Cast from his own home for lack of faith in his abilities, he quests for a means to prove himself and to protect his family and kingdom to live up to the belief his father instilled in him. Boji's removal from the center of events serves as an excellent point of inflection to the cast at large, providing him opportunities later on to redeem those who pushed him away. \n\nBoji's journey and overwhelming positivity at times sends conflicting messages when compared to darker themes integral to the show, but he is nonetheless critical to showcase its emotional highlights as well.  \n",

She was inspired by her savior into making the world a better place by giving anyone a second chance at life, similar to how she was given a second chance herself. Whether this is vapid or compelling depends on your preferences, but her ideals are put to the test both physically and mentally, and her principles inspire change in those around her.\nOnce the curtain is pulled back and her enigmatic character is fully explored, the intriguing personality and mysterious backstory ended up feeling a bit sloppily executed in comparison to the charming first half. The expository presentation of the Alan/Terrorism plot line was particularly sloppy, where the core moral dilemma was dragged out with an unsatisfying conclusion. Luckily, her role as a catalyst for others remained handled with utmost elegance in regards to her interactions with Takina. Their chemistry together was some of the best of the entire year - it's a true joy seeing Takina's cold exterior warm up over the course of the show, through Chisato's endearing attitude and the found-family at LycoReco.\nHer top-notch fashion sense with a large range of brilliantly color-coded outfits (episode 4 date outfit being a favorite), and the organic banter-y dialogue where Chika Anzai masterfully highlighted her sarcastic and teasing nature, made her a worthy nominee.

The fact of the matter is that the show would not work if we didn't come to empathize with and cheer David on. The show accomplishes this by allowing us to see his daily routine and trials and tribulations and then showing him undergoing loss and his very understandable emotions stemming from that. Even beyond dealing with loss, David's want and need to be special is a universal emotion. This connection is critical - for this story to ultimately work, we need to be able to connect with David and hope for a different outcome even as he heads towards his inevitable destiny.\n\nUnfortunately, while David is likable, he isn't as charismatic and doesn't draw the audience's attention like some of the other characters in the crew, which serves to emphasize his flaws as a character by immediate comparison. This could just be a consequence of his youth and inexperience and makes him easier to bounce off of as a character for the others. Still, it can mean he is overshadowed by Maine, Rebecca, or Lucy, who all have hints of backstories we only get glimpses of but could be equal to if not more interesting than David's somewhat tropey story. Even if not as major a draw as the characters around him, David's struggles and heart make you want to cheer for him, even until the bitter end.",

This season served as a reminder of how much freedom is a guiding light to Eren's actions as a character not only shedding light on events earlier in the story but also context on Eren's more recent turn as a character.\n\nSome of Eren's strongest moments as a character this season are comparing him as a foil with Zeke, his half-brother. Zeke's goals are just as much oriented on taking away choice as Eren's are about freedom. It is his offering someone a choice, freedom, after a long period of servitude, in direct opposition to Zeke's forceful ordering based on his royal bloodline, that is one of Eren's strongest moments in the whole story, much less this season.     \n\nEren's strongest moments as a foil betray his role as being more a tool of the larger series than as his own character. The spotlight on Eren in *Shingeki no Kyojin: The Final Season Part 2* mainly serves to explain his actions and motivation over the course of this season and the last. His actions are consistent based on previous seasons, but his direct involvement this season is too minimal, and that affects his placement considering he's judged only for the eligible season. His overall influence over the course of the show is still rather praiseworthy however, and lands him a well earned nomination.\n",

From a boy who had locked his emotions away out of shame, he has become a young adult who has come to accept himself, warts and all. Shigeo's tale shows clear growth and transition from meek and timid, to a more aware and confident person. In fact, seeing him as a relatively normal teen with the kinds of personal issues many teenagers deal with already having to deal with these powers is also a strength to Shigeo and his story.\n\nOverall, this season wraps up Shigeo's story and those of his supporting cast. Shigeo shines in several moments during the season, but apart from the final arc he is not the center of attention. The final arc focuses on Shigeo having to deal with the parts of himself he had locked away, but it is also not as strong as previous arcs in the story. It takes too long to reach its conclusion; as the finale of the entire series, it feels the need to give most of the story's important players one final moment, and consequently the arc wears out its welcome. Once we finally reach the conclusion though, it is still a strong and cathartic ending which sees Shigeo come to accept all of himself and have the confidence to put himself out there as a person. Ending the show seeing him laugh is the perfect way to not only show how much he has grown but the bright future awaiting him.",

But despite this scheming nature and her efforts to make her cuteness look effortless she is a hard worker who will pick up the slack of others if needed. Even with her being so self-centered she is the most aware of what others are doing of the friend group. Her confident cute persona at times feels like a mask for her self esteem issues. Her character growth is compelling as she learns to believe in herself and be who she really wants to be.\n\nMiruki is also the driver of a lot of the comedy in *Waccha Primagi!*. Her exaggerated reactions to the silly antics of the rest of the cast never get tiring, thanks to the contrast between her over the top reactions and her sugary cute persona.

In particular her interactions with Yui Yumekawa are highly enjoyable, with the two like minded characters causing chaos wherever they go. Maria's relationship with Rabbily is also very sweet and heartwarming, with Maria accepting her as a young and inexperienced mascot, and inspiring Rabbily to grow into what she wants to be. \n\nHowever, the simplicity of her character was also a double edged sword, with other characters in the category feeling more impactful with their fleshed out character arcs.

This is then turned into strong character growth, as she becomes more comfortable around humans, and she begins to cherish her time spent with the rest of the group, allowing her true self to come out.\n\nLaura plays an important role in the cast; in particular her relationship with Manatsu is dynamic, with Laura's tsundere traits bouncing off of Manatsu's endless energy well. When Laura isn't the focus of an episode she plays an important supporting role in the rest of the cast's arcs and helps keep the show lively and lighthearted. Whilst her arc is compelling, after the conclusion of it her role in the show grew stagnant along with other nominees boasting more relatable and personal story beats. Still, her impressive characterization along with accomplishing a complete and satisfying arc earns her a very well deserved nomination. ",

Karyl thrives as her more logical and careful nature heavily contrasts with the rest of the group's hijinks. Whenever chaos ensues and her friends rush straight into danger, Karyl is left to her own devices, where her brittle self-confidence and scaredy-cat behavior make her an adorable character to watch.\nHer ongoing conflict of choosing between her new found family and her master clash this season. Karyl goes through endearing growth as she comes to appreciate the simple pleasures of life and her friends. And rather than choosing one or the other, she tries to sell her master on this new lifestyle that she has come to love.\nKaryl also is by far the most expressive character in what is already a great production. The ample range of reaction faces and derpy character animation add a lot to her comedic distress and slapstick humor. Coupled with a very appealing design, and great acting work that perfectly captures her exaggerated reactions, Karyl is always a stand out whenever she is on-screen.\nWith such a well-animated character with a heartwarming growth, it's no surprise Karyl ends up being one of the most enjoyable characters of the category.",

From her more endearing scenes with Momo, to playing a great supporting role in Mikan's story arc, to her humorous moments with the cast of *Machikado Mazoku: 2-Choume*, Shamiko is always entertaining to see on screen. Watching her grow from constantly scheming and failing in Season 1 to choosing to get stronger so she can help her friends with their problems is a delight. This turns Shamiko from just another slapstick character into something more than that which works greatly in her favor.\n\nShamiko also stands out with her unique character design, the prime example being how her tail is used to showcase her feelings in the moment. *Machikado S2* utilizes simple visuals to great effect when animating Shamiko as a whole, allowing her to have a plethora of laughable moments throughout. Her voice actress, Konomi Kohara, does an excellent job enhancing Shamiko's comedic moments. Kohara seamlessly transitions between excitement and frustration to match Shamiko's sudden change in emotions; from shouts of determination to exhausted grunts when actually doing physical work. Kohara's emotional changes in her voice do the most to bring out Shamiko's humor. All in all, *Machikado S2* does an excellent job developing Shamiko as a character while still using her for amazing comedic moments!",

It doesn't matter whether it is a  porn game or a children's magical girl show, she finds a character she loves and enjoys cosplaying as them.

She ends up being a strong example of a Manic Pixie Dream Girl with her fun mannerisms and cause for growth in Gojo as well as from her natural chemistry with him.\n\nWhile Marin's spirit works well for fun moments the comedy around her is less appealing. Too much it relies on her being put into awkward situations with Gojou that mainly just titillates the audience. This fanservice is detrimental to her themes, which hurts her character a bit. Even if her humor is not as strong as some other characters, Marin's charisma and passionate energy make her a strong character in her own right.",

It is a formula that continues to deliver great comedic moments thanks to the cast of side characters that allow her to show multiple facets of her personality.\nKaguya benefits the most from the anime's visual presentation, as it constantly bombards the audience with great facial expressions and visual gags. This is combined with Aoi Koga's rangeas an actress, able to portray Kaguya's ice cold and condescending side just as well as her silly side, going on rapid fire rants and distressed ramblings that always gets a laugh regardless of the context.\nIn terms of character growth this season, Kaguya finally starts having doubts about her approach to getting a relationship with Shirogane and decides she should make the first move. While Kaguya being more honest about her feelings is a very welcome development, and the season ends in a very cathartic way, her role in it is disappointingly passive. The climax in the final stretch of the season occurs mostly thanks to the build up from Shirogane's part, leaving Kaguya as just the romantic interest that needs to say ‘yes' rather than something she worked to get, leaving doubts on how impactful her development is. Regardless, Kaguya remained a strong comedic lead with an amazing payoff to her character arc.",

Ai, being a veteran of playing similar characters, brings her energetic voice to Power, and utilizes that energy to bring out Power's more insane comments over the course of the show, making the statements more humorous in the process. \n\nYet, while Power is an entertaining character, her gimmick is all she really has. Power lacks depth, and all her actions and dialogue seem to exist only to enforce her insanity. These moments and spoken lines do not do much to contribute to other potential character traits that Power may have. In spite of this flaw, Power still is an enjoyable character and a comedic highlight of *Chainsaw Man*! ",

Her personality and desire to try her best to help out her father is admirable, and it's heartwarming to see how much she cares for him and how Loid learns to reciprocate. \n\nBeyond just reacting, her childish innocence is great for humorous moments of her own, making silly decisions and saying silly things that draw out the absurdity of using Anya in Loid's secret mission. She drives many of the funniest moments of the show such as getting Loid to perform a James Bond impression or her interactions with the other school kids. It also helps sell the strength of her parents' care for her as they try to be a happy and supportive family in spite of the absurd situation they find themselves in. \n\nHowever, unlike other characters in the category, she plays second fiddle to Loid and Yor who are equally strong characters that also contribute to a lot of the great moments in *SPYxFAMILIY*. Anya generally lacks depth and feels repetitive at times. Despite that, the fun that Anya is able to provide for the show was much appreciated and makes her a top character of the year.",

Whether it is her paranoid fantasies or her absurd attempts at communicating with others, Hitori's anxiety and the comedy surrounding it is always amusing. Despite the often surreal portrayal of her behavior it still found a way to be relatable.\nIt can't be overstated how much the writing of Hitori's anxiety goes hand-in-hand with the visual presentation of the anime. Her consistently expressive character animation helps the delivery of her jokes. But it is Saitou Keiichirou's creative direction that really gets across how Hitori is feeling. Her fantasies are so divorced from reality that switching to a different animation style or using mixed media like paper cut-outs or real life footage fits perfectly. It is inferred that she can't stand being questioned when her facial features melt like ice cream, or that her self-esteem is so low that she often pictures herself as a slug. On top of all that, an amazing performance from Aoyama Yoshino nails the trembling speech, uncomfortable giggling and unhinged rambling to truly convey the communication and awareness issues of Hitori. \nThe adaptation of Bocchi The Rock goes through great lengths using the audiovisual nature of the medium to deliver one of the funniest characters of the year.",

Like the Chimimoryo, these issues may seem small from an outsider's perspective, but can be real painful to experience first-hand.\n\nJigoku-san serves the role of foreigner working abroad, failing to meet the expectations from his superior and confused about the culture/customs of modern Japan. The Onigami sisters serve as a found family for Jigoku-san. Jigoku-san has different relationships with each of these sisters: he acts as a father-figure for Mei, a mischievous brother for Hazuki, and a tenant & sometimes trustworthy caretaker with Mutsumi. While Mutsumi was mostly underutilized, Hazuki provided many infectiously fun moments despite annoying her castmates through chasing money-making schemes and alcohol.\nMarshmallowy bodies allow the Chimimoryo spirits to squash and morph, where cartoony shenanigans ensue as they glide around with hilarious sound effects accompanied by a mischievously pleasant OST. Bright colors with thick outlines and minimalistic detail, make the designs charmingly goofy, especially when contrasted against the sketchy pastel backgrounds.\n\nThe supporting cast does not stand out, outside of Senpai. Her hip, gyaru attitude, coupled with several traits borrowed from the Onigami sisters (Mei's social media obsession, Mutsumi's bossiness, and Hazuki's carefree nature), made her a joy to watch interact with the surrounding cast.\nWhile not having the highs of its contemporaries, *Chimimo*'s brilliant character chemistry and its merging of relatable comedic and wholesome family moments, result in a very deserving cast nomination.",

In the series we see Akebi go into middle school and excitedly face the prospect of getting to know her new classmates. As Akebi obsesses over how she will fit into the class and how she compares to others, it's unveiled that many of her classmates struggle with the same things. Through this class of 16 characters the series tackles a wide array of ‘coming–of-age' themes such as tackling your own negative self-image, the struggle between fitting in and standing out, or being allowed to feel attractive.\n\nThe show's wide diversity of character designs makes each character feel unique. The animation breathes life into these characters as each of them is given a distinct body language and way of moving. Even when characters are not the focus of the scene, we see them interacting in the background, developing friendships between each other, and being a part of the classroom in a way that is incredibly enriching to the cast experience. Not a single character is left behind as a faceless, nameless background feature; every single one of them has their own distinct, fleshed out personality, friendships and place in the class. *Akebi's Sailor Uniform* is a masterclass on the small things that make a character feel real, fleshed out, and compelling.",

          "writeup": "Part 2 of *Vanitas no Carte* carries forward its tremendous aesthetic from Part 1, though with a greater focus on exploring the depth of its cast. With Vanitas himself acting as the centerpiece, characters are explored through flashbacks and real-time events, meaningfully fleshing out the show's large cast. From Vanitas' and Astolfo's mirror-like journeys to healing and violence respectively, to the tumultuous and codependent relationship of Noe and Domi, the present and past often collide in order to present multiple sides to the cast. Vanitas and Jeanne's budding romance is endearingly cute, with the genuine turn in a relationship that had been built on teasing and foreplay a welcome addition to a cast that struggles to be honest with each other. Their care for each other and stumbles into first love were refreshingly sweet, and their date episode was a highlight of the season.\n\nHowever, *Vanitas* is occasionally held back by an overreliance on flashbacks to illustrate character development. Such an overused storytelling mechanic necessitates originality and ingenuity in order to shine, and *Vanitas* does not always meet that requirement. Astolfo, who struggles to stand as more than a parallel to Vanitas with his backstory of loss, and Mikhail, whose flashbacks serve mostly to further a conflict between Vanitas and Noe, stand out as poor examples against the brilliant usage of flashbacks for Domi. The show took great strides in its second season, but the cast still has unexplored room for growth.",

          "writeup": "To be the sequel of a beloved anime brings with it much baggage. \"Where does it go from here? How can they expand on a complete story?\" Such questions may be asked. For *Yojouhan Time Machine Blues*, the answer can be summarized like the riff from a *Seinfeld* episode: nothing has to happen when all is really needed is to spend more time with the characters and experience their fantastic chemistry. *YTMB* manages to explore new sides of its entire cast in a short runtime that completely recontextualizes its parent show. No longer is the world seen only through the jaded and pessimistic eyes of Watashi. Instead, the cast is shown through a more objective lens, and their quirkiness is brought down to Earth. Jougasaki and Akashi are two of the best examples of this. Where Watashi portrayed Jougasaki as a perverted and domineering jock, he is shown as the ideal straight man of a wild and wacky friend group in *YTMB*. Alternatively, Akashi's mysterious and distant visage is unraveled after being taken away from Watashi's expectations. She is instead presented as a levelheaded, occasionally goofy, girl.\n\nWhile the film's rowdier characters (specifically Higuchi and Hanuki) received more muted praise, they still retained fantastic chemistry with the rest of the cast. Even Ozu, his gremlin-like nature still intact from the parent series, gains a straightforward facet for his character in his genuine support and friendship with Watashi. These new sides to beloved characters give *YTMB* one of the best casts of 2022.",

Loid plays the straight-man to the air-headed Yor and ball of chaotic childish wonder that is Anya,  making for easy comedy in any number of situations. The main negative in their dynamic is the lack of development in Loid and Yor's relationship, as their attachments are primarily to Anya as parents, and not to each other.\n\nYor's treatment in particular is disappointing, specifically in how imbalanced her role is compared to Loid. While Loid's role as a spy and his missions are always prominent, it's easy to forget that Yor is supposed to be a feared assassin when most of her time is spent on trying to become a dutiful housewife.\n\nThe side cast is a mixed bag.

Characters like Yuri and Nightfall, however, are either highly enjoyable or intolerable depending on if their gag clicks for the viewer.\n \n*Spy x Family*'s cast members have plenty of personality and room to grow, but haven't yet been utilized to their full potential.",

This fact is reinforced throughout the series as the characters' questionable motivations are revealed. \n\nThe series balances the intricate story of characters like Aki or Himeno with the unhinged carnal craziness of Denji and Power in a way that creates a compelling dichotomy, equal parts humorous and poignant. However, while the main trio functions well as a group and Himeno is a great character to explore in this first season, the majority of supporting characters feel underdeveloped. Kobeni, Kishibe and Arai feel largely one-dimensional, and while Makima's mysterious allure is compelling, she never truly gets fleshed out much as a result. That being said, by the end of the series *CSM* establishes a strong narrative foundation through its main cast and offers glimpses of new characters that will undoubtedly be developed in future seasons, making for an exciting future for the series and its cast.",

Each member of the core cast develops their personalities and relationships with each other, and the wide variety of supporting characters are utilized to great effect.  The cast bounce off each other perfectly in a variety of combinations thanks to sharp writing and excellent voice acting.\n\n*Ultra Romantic* puts Shirogane and Kaguya to center stage, changing their dynamic by forcing a sense of urgency and deepening their relationship by diving into their insecurities. Ishigami and Iino continue to come into their own by throwing themselves into activities and relationships beyond the Student Council, and the culmination of Hayasaka's personal arc of breaking out of Kaguya's shadow was perfectly executed. The lone static character, Chika, requires no significant development as she's already perfect in her role as a catalyst for much of the show's comedic gags.\n\nMaki makes her introduction this season as an instant favorite. Her spunk, vulnerability, and lightning-fast switches between those two modes make her uniquely endearing among tsundere characters, and her dynamic with Shirogane and Ishigami is delightful. Other standout relationships include Kaguya's mentorship of Ishigami and Shirogane and Hayasaka's burgeoning friendship.\n\nBoth individually and as an ensemble, the cast of *Kaguya-sama* remains one of the very best in anime as the series continues to explore its characters in exciting ways.",

          "writeup": "*Bocchi the Rock!* is a marvel among the crowded releases of CGDCT slice of life shows. In familiar fashion, the four-girl core of Bocchi, Nijika, Ryou and Kita captivate viewers through their strongly individual personalities clashing together in their amateur band. *Bocchi* distinguishes itself among these shows through the heartfelt exploration of social anxiety, with Bocchi doing her best to avoid center stage. \n\nWith undeniable comedic prestige, light-hearted banter, and hard-hitting truth punches, Kessoku Band brings warm feelings of inclusion and encouraging affirmations for the anxious Bocchi. Nijika and Kita's roles as foils to the failed extroversion of Bocchi ground the series in realism, as people that honestly move to connect with people isolated in their own worlds. Furthermore, Nijika and Ryou's existing friendship is well-utilized as an example of an attainable type of relationship for Bocchi. Ryou's cheekily skeevy nature is effectively used to cement bonds, and Nijika's desires for success as a band work in partnership to bring out the best parts of Bocchi.  \n\nOutside of Kessoku Band, characters such as Seika and Hiroi fulfill a supporting role for nurturing their musical prowess. As adult figures they provide mooring points for their dreams as a band, and the directions they can go in the future. Bocchi's family are additionally great supporting characters, who never fail to haphazardly carry her through struggles with humor and warmth.  \n\n*Bocchi the Rock!*'s cast is an eclectic mix of personalities, effectively brought together through the show's comedic elements.",

While not having the depth of Fall’s offering, the rest of the year doesn’t fall short either, with the twin Cloverworks offering of *Akebi-san* and *Bisque Doll* in Winter as well as *Priconne S2* being standout highlights. Given such a strong slate, it was only befitting to increase the slate of production nominees to an expanded list of 10. This also made choosing the final nominees a breeze with only *Orbital Children* and the aforementioned *Bisque Doll* falling short of being nominated.\n\nMoving onto final rankings, the discussion came down to the perennial value judgements of variety versus consistency. However, another pertinent argument this year was the value of character acting as a means of expressing a character’s personality, rather than just imbuing weight to day-to-day activities. Keeping these in mind, the top two shows stood head and shoulders above the rest of the pack as they excelled in both variety and consistency.",

For example, when [Aoi and Kasumi are walking up Takao](https://i.imgur.com/Usk3uIp.mp4), Kasumi's belabored walk cycle feels surgically in line with her evident struggle, while Aoi, the seasoned climber she is, plods forward with ease. Masami Mori's animation emphasizes a throughline of growth, showing a tangible contrast between Aoi and not only a less experienced hiker, but also herself in the past. Another example is [Hinata's mom's pent up tension](https://i.imgur.com/XkXEMtY.mp4), being brought to life by Yusei Koumoto's detail-oriented supervision, that is ultimately released in a [glorious fury of loose animation](https://i.imgur.com/l2XWQOP.mp4). \n\nWhile the season features many solo key-animated half-episodes, Norio Matsumoto's effort [stands out](https://i.imgur.com/8jLB8Gp.mp4) with its [thorough](https://i.imgur.com/KttKup5.mp4) presentation of a [rigorous](https://i.imgur.com/D26pxSK.mp4) running [regimen](https://i.imgur.com/NCF7clT.mp4).

There are also fun highlights in the cold opens of the recap episodes, in particular, [Hisashi Mori's kinetic roller-coaster scene](https://i.imgur.com/Pk6AHMP.mp4).\n\nIn the end, *Next Summit* briskly climbed to the top of the category on the back of its talented crew putting out the most consistently charming production this year.",

          "writeup": "*Do It Yourself*'s charming, expressive character animation immediately set a high standard for itself. One of the strongest points of praise is not just the animation in isolation, but how the character acting depicts the cast's unique quirks. Each character's distinct personality is demonstrated in their body language, like [Serufu's airy wandering](https://i.imgur.com/juuWqFJ.mp4), [Shii's energy](https://i.imgur.com/bfa7LCO.mp4), or [Takumi's timidity](https://i.imgur.com/h4amGUs.mp4). Another recurring high point is the show's namesake DIY projects, which get special attention via [tool and craft animation](https://i.imgur.com/ppzaBGf.mp4). The detail and accuracy of the tools' mechanical movement, resin's slow flow, and [the girls' precise handling](https://i.imgur.com/uZK92Ye.mp4) give an authentic representation of projects large and small.\n\nWhile the animation excels in the first half of the season, the same cannot be said for later episodes. Coming off of an extremely strong episode six, episodes seven onward immediately lose both quantity and quality. Stills and simple movements become the norm and even the bright spots in character animation are more mechanical and less lively than before. Another noticeable loss is that [Serufu's delightful dream sequences](https://i.imgur.com/oDBep6j.mp4) are barely present in the second half. Thankfully, the last two episodes are able to make a comeback and end the series on a high note.\n\nAll of this animation is enabled by excellent character designs by Yusuke Matsuo. *Do It Yourself*'s animation peaks include both [realistic, weighty movements](https://i.imgur.com/Wk5s8D5.mp4) and [exaggerated, cartoony poses](https://i.imgur.com/yphNib2.mp4) and the designs help these two extremes feel right at home.

However, given *Cyberpunk Edgerunners*' overly polished nature, these influences are  downplayed compared to the studio's back catalog. Nevertheless, there are still notable occasions where their usual style stands out, such as [the chase in episode 3](https://i.imgur.com/i9RD9mq.mp4), which culminates in an [insane four-way battle animated by Ichigo Kanno, with dynamic poses, geometric sparks, and an incredible cut showing off an idiosyncratic blood spray](https://i.imgur.com/LPvaiLc.mp4).

          "writeup": "*Chainsaw Man* took on an ambitious challenge from the outset. The show wasn't content to be another action spectacle like Mappa's previous shounen megahit, *Jujutsu Kaisen*. Instead, it also aimed to be a character acting clinic, deliberately reducing the expressivity of manga-inspired facial reactions in favor of carefully considered body language and subtle gestures to convey the characters' personalities and emotions in any given scene.\n\nInitially, this approach worked spectacularly well. Moments like [Aki's thoroughly depicted morning routine in episode 4](https://i.imgur.com/CZI9qTi.mp4) did a fantastic job of making the characters more relatable. However, it soon became too much for the crew to handle on their dangerously tight schedule, resulting [in a series](https://i.imgur.com/ttWUY9H.mp4) of [“broken” episodes](https://i.imgur.com/FFYyegu.mp4) as it [came to a close](https://i.imgur.com/OXHQUVj.mp4). This ultimately led to climactic moments like [Aki's emotional breakdown in episode 10](https://i.imgur.com/25XTGNo.mp4) being an ugly mess where the inbetween frames awkwardly morph as they desperately try to keep up with the motion indicated in the keyframes.\n\nThe action side of the show fared much better with this crunch in schedule, with only the [Katana fight in the finale](https://i.imgur.com/7isvdfU.mp4) being relegated to a weightless CG set-piece. Otherwise, even late-game fights like [Kishibe vs Power and Denji](https://i.imgur.com/0o09KvF.mp4) stood out with their snappy timing and use of triple takes to increase the visceral impact.\n\nDespite the show's shortcomings, the staff's clear ambition and their ability to achieve a large chunk of what they set out to do makes *Chainsaw Man* an exciting watch from an animation point of view.",

The character designs can bend and form into any desirable shape and still retain their identity, aiding in depictions of Bocchi's mental state as a sort of visualization that extrapolates the anguish she feels in each interaction.\n\nOne of the best depictions of realism comes from Nijika comforting Bocchi that shows the [delicate weight of her hand movements and how she carefully bows before running off](https://i.imgur.com/yCrTn5Y.mp4). While there is some incredibly fun exaggeration in another scene where [Nijika runs off and Bocchi is left in a state of disarray](https://i.imgur.com/jwOIVAw.mp4), the smears in both of their expressions are extremely heavy and amplify the comedic tone of the scene.\n\nThat being said, *Bocchi* has a few struggles when it comes to concert sequences, where some of the 3D-assist and rotoscoping are [stiffly executed](https://i.imgur.com/orIy22z.mp4), and background mob animation notably suffers later in the season.

          "writeup": "The main appeal of *Kimetsu no Yaiba*'s animation has always been its strong inbetweening work, which facilitates its crazy rotations, and its uniquely stylized effects work, which are the series' core identity. Continuing this tradition, effects specialists like Nozumu Abe and Makoto Nakamura deliver some [great work](https://i.imgur.com/ZOPJMfW.mp4) here as usual. However, the animation is somewhat less exciting compared to the franchise's previous highs, often being sandwiched between [poor CG iterations of the established breathing techniques](https://i.imgur.com/zdHbO4i.mp4) or [the CG fabric of Daki's obi](https://i.imgur.com/kGZoCS2.mp4). In addition, the stock [composited fireworks for Uzui's sound breathing](https://i.imgur.com/VIKhd1F.mp4) are notably inconsistent with the rest of the franchise's aesthetic, detracting from the overall quality of the animation.\n\nJust like the previous iterations of the franchise, this season is also plagued with stiff character acting. Important scenes like [Shinjuro's emotional breakdown over Kyojuro's final message](https://i.imgur.com/JFLGXhp.mp4) or the [touching reconciliation of Gyutaro and Ume](https://i.imgur.com/R44wluX.mp4) are presented rather ineffectually, particularly when compared to the acting chops that the rest of the nominees display here.\n\nDespite these faults, the show deserves praise for presenting a continuous fight spectacle for six straight episodes. A bevy of in-house ufotable regulars like Masayuki Kunihiro, Mitsuru Obunai, and Go Kimura feature their talents throughout this showcase. Keeping consistently solid drawings has endeared the studio's output to a broad and loving public, and despite  the daunting workload of this season of *Yaiba*, they certainly don't disappoint in that department.",

From the watercolor stylings of *Deaimon* and *Maiko-san Chi no Makanai-san* to the thick impasto of *Baraou no Souretsu*’s paintings. The one exception being *Ousama Ranking* which uses a mix of scanned analog paintings done with nicker paint alongside digital recreations of the same picture book style. Another notable trend here was the usage of backgrounds dominated by singular color schemes being a hallmark feature of both *Cyberpunk Edgerunners* and *Yofukashi no Uta* as well as the night scenes of *Do It Yourself*.  Amongst the bevy of original titles mentioned above was also the return of two juggernaut franchises in *Made in Abyss* and *Yama no Susume*, both of which have made their name in large part with their spectacular backgrounds. Given such a strong field of contenders, the task of narrowing down the rankings was incredibly difficult. We chose to examine the nominees on both aesthetic and thematic grounds as well as their consistency and variety in both regards. Under this lens, *Deaimon* and *DIY* emerged as the near unanimous top two picks for the jury. The bottom three choices were also fairly well agreed upon with only minor quibbles about their exact rankings ensuing. The real battle was choosing between the fantastic middle pack this year with all five excelling in different avenues while suffering in other ones.",

          "writeup": "With little else going for it visually, *Baraou no Souretsu*'s backgrounds shoulder the weight of the storytelling—a daunting task. *Baraou* rises to the challenge with a [unique, oil-paint-inspired style which provides texture and artistic detail](https://imgur.com/a/gXR9TbZ). It abstracts enough to place focus on the emotional conflicts that carry the series narratively, especially those of Richard. Our protagonist is often in a dark place emotionally, and the [backgrounds reciprocate](https://i.imgur.com/xK918zB.jpg). Black prevails in most frames, generally accented by a single color—purple, red, brown. Occasionally the backgrounds step explicitly into the storytelling role, illustrating an emotional state, like [Richard wrapped in thorns](https://i.imgur.com/Qe0mcec.jpg), or a sequence of events, like [the river scene in episode 4](https://imgur.com/a/b5GZMb3). Naturally, [gorgeous shots of roses](https://imgur.com/a/ZwkVE5T) abound.\n\nWhile an overall gloomy palette may not appeal to everyone, the [scenes with Richard's “Joan of Arc''](https://i.imgur.com/0KSBSrM.jpg) are bright and garish in all the wrong ways. Other weaknesses are found in scenes with [CG background assets](https://i.imgur.com/ThXyoIM.jpg), the imperfect filtering of which makes for awkward-looking edges. Also, while many scenes are rich in terms of unique backgrounds, some, such as the battle scenes, are left lacking, with similar shots of sky or forest predominating. Episode 3 is an exception,\ninterspersed with [impasto-heavy paintings of Richard fighting](https://imgur.com/a/SPU0wyc).\n\nOccasionally rough around the edges, *Baraou no Souretsu* strengths ultimately lie equally between its [richly textured, faux-paint style](https://imgur.com/a/LaHm4ij), and the way in which it leverages this to carry both [surface-level storytelling](https://i.imgur.com/an0KNFw.jpg) and the [mood of scenes](https://i.imgur.com/Za4iDHb.jpg).

A firm grasp of color, texture, and depth allow it to depict the [raw beauty of Kyoto](https://i.imgur.com/b02G9Wb.jpg), particularly [its foliage](https://i.imgur.com/5J8WWiU.jpg), throughout a variety of seasons. \n\n*Deaimon* asks the same of viewers that the Wagashiya ask of their customers: a careful and attentive eye to the measured, concise package it delivers. The [white outlines on objects](https://i.imgur.com/ZQkdAgE.jpg) allow for careful organization of elements by depth and a sense of overflowing light, creating highly readable and bright backgrounds. Small tonal touches like [defining shadows underneath leaves using flourishes of cangiante azure](https://i.imgur.com/GIi30ZC.jpg) retain a sense of form without introducing muddiness through desaturation. *Deaimon* crafts [verdant landscapes](https://i.imgur.com/8x6U3or.jpg) with clarity and colorfulness that other series would struggle to acquire a fraction of. If the show does falter somewhere, it's often in the interior layouts, which struggle to match the level of the nature shots presented in the show.\n\nBeyond inventive use of color and layering, *Deaimon* integrates its foliage thematically - as the Wagashi are attuned to the seasons, so does *Deaimon* gently visually sweep us, from [spring greens](https://i.imgur.com/MxSFd0E.jpg) to [autumn reds](https://i.imgur.com/V1La9ZC.jpg). [Ripe chestnuts](https://i.imgur.com/gCroJAn.jpg), [sakura blossoms](https://i.imgur.com/I32x4xD.jpg), [orange maple leaves](https://i.imgur.com/tyhWqHP.jpg), and [blooming hydrangeas](https://i.imgur.com/R0j0LaZ.jpg) form important seasonal pillow shots that connect the passage of time within the show.",

          "writeup": "*Yama no Susume*'s fourth season covers more of Japan's scenic mountain ranges than ever before, with thirteen distinct climbs in its eight-episode run. This season not only features more mountains, but also boasts an improvement in the quality of their depiction, with the art capturing the [verdant forests](https://i.imgur.com/8YDDHzv.jpg), [glistening streams](https://i.imgur.com/0TG7tqm.jpg), and [rocky outcroppings](https://i.imgur.com/DpMqE1M.jpg) that define mountain landscapes in richer detail and texture than ever before.\n\nAyumi Miyakoshi's team of background artists use a wide variety of techniques, including [processed photographs](https://i.imgur.com/IiiIIzP.jpg), [digitally-painted illustrative lighting](https://i.imgur.com/4dDu1zZ.jpg), and [strong multiplanar layering](https://i.imgur.com/iRxGXm1.jpg) of elements; all of which create a rich visual style that immerses the viewer in the natural world. However, such a wide pool of techniques also causes issues with consistency, with the application of photographic backgrounds, in particular, ranging from the [perfectly processed ones](https://i.imgur.com/ih32jxW.jpg) in episode 7 to the [poorly filtered ones](https://i.imgur.com/6ceX0BP.jpg) in episode 5.\n\nIn addition to the issues with consistency, the show's indoor shots are typically presented in a plain, unembellished style. However, the vast majority of this season takes place in the natural world, which is regularly strikingly portrayed, mitigating this issue.\n\nThe finale is a notable showcase of the series' backgrounds at their best, capturing all phases of Aoi's emotional journey through Mt. Fuji and [culminating in one](https://i.imgur.com/1pSA52b.jpg) that perfectly caps off the peak of her character arc.",

          "writeup": "Like [illustrations straight out of a picture book](https://i.imgur.com/m1jqhDp.jpg) *Ousama Ranking*'s backgrounds are able to showcase its fantasy world with childlike wonder. And this painterly style, a hallmark of its art director Yuuji Kaneko, allows for the backgrounds to be [simple texturally but imply more detail](https://i.imgur.com/n8LpZCR.jpg) than is actually there.\n\nThough even with the show's strong art style the latter half of *Ousama* is set in very few locations and even within them there is hardly any diversity in their environments with the vast majority being set in the [castle's courtyard](https://i.imgur.com/WIIyL6O.jpg). In addition, the show doesn't attempt anything that would help alleviate this problem such as using a variety of different angles or lighting. This makes the second half of *Ousama* a big step down compared to the first half which is really able to sell the adventure nature of the show with a [good variety of backgrounds](https://imgur.com/a/GfuBI6l). The [underworld kingdom](https://imgur.com/a/HnWzFKL) contrasts well [when compared](https://i.imgur.com/NN2Wi1Q.jpg) to the more typical [fantasy architecture](https://i.imgur.com/tMPRtnj.jpg) on display at the very start of the show. And then there are strong backgrounds closer to home in the castle, for example the [snake cave lit with glowing crystals](https://i.imgur.com/QprBt5Z.jpg), and areas under the castle such as [the dungeons with the ominous frozen monsters](https://i.imgur.com/Ev9Cvuq.jpg).\n\n*Ousama Ranking*'s backgrounds do effectively convey Bojji's journey throughout the show, so despite the lack of variation, they are able to stand out as potent art that forges the show's core picture book theme.",

These fades not only give the show a unique aesthetic, but also visually convey its themes of the value of handmade art, where slight imperfections only add to their charm. The show furthers its already strong visual identity by having distinct color schemes for different times of day, with the [violet nights](https://i.imgur.com/1YGM36K.jpg) and [chartreuse yellow dusks](https://i.imgur.com/o0gkr2D.jpg) making for vivid backgrounds.\n\nThe backgrounds further convey the show's themes by creating striking contrast between [YuuVoc's technologically-advanced and GataGirls' traditional schools](https://i.imgur.com/2QyzIMF.jpg). The show is also able to create [authentically lived-in rooms](https://i.imgur.com/cwSGj5r.jpg) for its primary cast - [Jobko's ninja scrolls](https://i.imgur.com/Sq7ARQP.jpg) are a particularly fun highlight.

One of these is [Yua's imaginary sequences](https://i.imgur.com/43EQH6h.jpg), which allow the in-house art team at Pine Jam to experiment with art styles beyond the show's usual toolbox. The other is the beach in episode 6, which gives the art team a different locale to depict in the show's style.

[The club](https://i.imgur.com/JKYqdyS.jpg) especially gets a lot of attention in this respect, which is a boon given how many scenes are set here. When the show *does* illustrate backgrounds from scratch, as it does in some of [Hitori's fantasies](https://imgur.com/a/zXyKzuz), they tend to look quite nice, and the infrequent nature of these moments means they're always a treat.\n\nThe principal weakness of *Bocchi*'s backgrounds is that they are artistically plain. Clearly the real life locations in [Shimokitazawa](https://i.imgur.com/cfC516V.jpg) were visited and photographed, but there's neither a huge amount of locations present in the show nor is there much impressive about how [they've been processed](https://i.imgur.com/ZCJqfCb.jpg).\n\nIn the end, it's not that the background art does a poor job. Rather, it's outshined by nominations that both fit their show aesthetically or thematically, and also flex their artistic prowess in the process.

There's also pretty lazy reuse of these assets, be it for indoor shots like the [uniforms adorning the cafe breakroom](https://i.imgur.com/81wnJwX.jpg), or all the [anemic foliage on the streets](https://i.imgur.com/u0xPw7G.jpg) which barely seem to be impacted by the dominant color scheme of a scene.\n\nThe color scheme, which is the show's chief asset, is limited to three major tones - [electric yellow](https://i.imgur.com/3ZT1TEd.jpg), [royal purple](https://i.imgur.com/CZ7eT7P.jpg), and [night blue](https://i.imgur.com/Tv7M9xJ.jpg). It's a heady combo which, in serendipitous moments, provides a remarkable vision of nightlife that is as alluring for the audience as it is from [Kou's perspective](https://i.imgur.com/CaB30WI.jpg). Sadly, a lot of the time, the show swaps between these tones almost randomly, with no real narrative impact. There is one major exception to this trend in [Anko's introduction](https://imgur.com/a/DhVj1EM) in episode 11, wherein the show saps all color from the backgrounds for a second and then turns it up to sepia as Anko enters the scene. The buildings also become silhouetted to add to the contrast with her commanding figure. It's a perfect example of purposefully changing the color scheme of the background art to better tell the narrative, and the show's art would be greatly improved if it applied this care regularly.",

Nominees were evaluated based on multiple criteria. Some of the most important ones were: animation friendliness & expressivity; how these static design sheets are translated into animation; suitability of the designs for a character’s personality and their ability to inform the narrative; and aesthetic qualities like coloring, diversity of shapes, line-art, and overall strong visual identity. While the solid joseimuke designs of *Fuuto Pi*, the variable weighty line art of *Bucchigire*, the creatively implemented technology of *Chikyuugai Shounen Shoujo*, and slick faces & ovoid eyes of *Vampire in the Garden*, had to unfortunately be cut, even their strongest supporters felt we were left with a line-up of strong nominees. Furthermore, despite no sequels making the cut, they were not ignored. *BLEACH: Sennen Kessen-hen*’s transformative designs, *Princess Connect! Re:Dive Season 2*’s variety of new characters, and *Yama no Susume: Next Summit*’s playful deviations from its design sheets were all shortlisted and discussed. *CYBERPUNK: EDGERUNNERS* idiosyncratic shape-language and *Ousama Ranking*’s adorable cartoon style impressed. The brilliant color-coded fashion of *Lycoris Recoil* and the intricately crafted cosplay of *Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru* further made the final rankings uncertain due to the sheer variety of quality designs. The only exception to this tight race was *Do it Yourself*, whose pleasant visual identity and distinct expressivity received universal praise.",

Pretty Cure* is an exceptional entry in the *PreCure* franchise in many ways, from the main Cure, Manatsu, having a rainbow color scheme instead of the traditional pink to even the mascot character, Kururun, getting a cheeky henshin.\n\nAll five Cures have strong designs with distinct silhouettes and solid motifs that match their theme. Cure Flamingo stands out with elements like her winged shoulder pads and fishnets that show off her maturity while honoring the flamingo theme. Laura is another standout both in her mermaid form and her Cure form, which gives her legs while keeping the illusion of her tail with the pattern of her stockings and platform pumps.\n\nThere are a lot of monsters due to the show's monster-of-the-week nature, but many of them are simple objects with faces and limbs tacked on. Similarly, the side cast is plain. There are notable exceptions though, like Yuriko, who serves as a good counterpart to Asuka with their contrasting red/blue color coding, or the villains with their sea creature-inspired designs.\n\n*TroPri*'s designs stand out from its base design sheets through its commitment to a fun design philosophy, simply asking its animation directors to create as many funny expressions as possible. Ken Ueno, in particular, stands out in this department with his distinct usage of variable line weight. However, it's not all just good cartoony fun, as the designs can turn up the intensity when the occasion calls for it, notably in the penultimate episode which prominently features Yuu Yoshiyama's unhinged shading.",

          "writeup": "*Akebi-chan no Sailor Fuku*'s contrast between realism with an immense focus on well-defined anatomy and exaggerated facial shapes with distinct droopy eyes, is brilliantly adapted into animation designs by Megumi Kuono. While a bit fetishized, its adolescent cast isn't limited to conventional anime beauty, featuring a variety of body types through delicate line-work, intimately communicating their personalities through detailed mannerisms. The distinct facial and eye shapes accentuate their uniquely expressive visual identity, but can sometimes seem alien & weird, despite effectively conveying the awkwardness of its adolescent cast. Highlighting important moments with beautified make-up shots has mixed results, at times edging towards the uncanny valley. Outside of episodes 1, 7 and 12, most episodes fail to capture the full potential of their designs. \n\nAkebi's sailor uniform serves as a cathartic transformation from a child into a beautiful girl. Its striking imagery in a sea of blazers beautifully expresses isolation versus individuality, while also working as a nostalgic baton embracing the past and sprinting towards the future. There is an impressive devotion dedicated to depicting the fluttering of hair & clothes, but the unrestrained self-indulgence of fabric wrinkles was inconsistent, at times abnormally emphasized and others barely noticeable.\n\nKuono's idiosyncratic designs receive mixed reception, where a lackluster casual wardrobe made up of many single colored t-shirts, place *Akebi* below its contemporaries, despite excelling in specific aspects.",

The thin lineart and flat colors help accentuate distinct shapes, giving an interesting bit of angularity in the models. The low line count and limited detail help the characters move in energetic ways, and the fun expressions and variations on the designs keep everything fresh throughout. The show even plays with the shadows of the hair, giving them  contrasting colors to the primary hair colors  for added visual flair.\n\nEach character's design gives a strong impression of their personality. They all have significant but not overwhelming color identities, most interestingly in Shii's tricolor color scheme which also matches her Sbai.  Each character's outfits embody who they are, both in their uniforms and their casual clothes. Purin and Takumin's uniforms are always proper, while Serufu and Rei are more messy, with Serufu never having her shirt completely tucked in or Rei never wearing a ribbon.\n\n*Do It Yourself* not only has stellar designs for its main cast, but also its supporting characters.The parents' designs give a sense of lineage to their children, but remain distinct and interesting on their own. Serufu's pets' designs ooze personality. There was even a conscious effort to differentiate characters that only show up for a scene or two.\n\nOverall, *Do It Yourself* distinguishes itself as one show to not miss.",

          "writeup": "*Spy x Family*'s design appeal lies primarily in the spy and his family. Loid, the spy, is meant to be a fairly unremarkable ikemen by design, but the addition of a rounded jawline by adaptation designer Kazuoki Shimada gives him a distinct charm over run-of-the-mill protagonists. His wife, Yor, perfectly encapsulates 1960s mod fashion in her regular wardrobe, making for an intriguing contrast with her thorny assassin persona. However, the star of the show is definitely their daughter, Anya, whose design is made rounder by Shimada to enhance her cuteness and perfectly sell her plethora of now-iconic faces including her unwittingly haughty smirk.\n\nThe side cast has hit or miss designs. Characters like the Handler, with her hat providing a distinctive silhouette, and the Housemaster, with his ridiculously long mustache, exemplify the appeal of the show's designs at their best. However, a lot of other cast members like Yuri, Yor's colleagues, or the Campbells, are fairly milquetoast. Additionally, the design supervision is rather one-note, with the exception of some dramatic moments, touched up by Kyoji Asano, which increase the sharpness of the designs for greater impact.\n\nThere is a lot to love about the show, with Anya as its flag bearer in her gold-trimmed uniform, which is why it is a worthy nominee in a strong field.",

          "writeup": "As a show about cosplay, *Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru* spends an inordinate amount of attention and energy capturing the realism of the deluge of outfits presented within. These include the firm boning in Shizuku-tan's cancan, which makes her outfit fluffy; Black Lobelia's stiff shoulder pads, studded epaulets, and ornate brocade corset; Juju's Black Lily cosplay with its flowing cape and regal gold trimming; and the B Holder bra that Shinju wears for crossdressing. The show completely nails each of its major cosplay outfits while highlighting the work required to create these diverse looks. Additionally, the lovely homage to Yoshihiko Umakoshi's work in the designs of the characters of the in-universe mahou shoujo *Flower Princess Blaze* does a good job of establishing the show's endearment, not just towards cosplaying as a hobby, but also the works that inspire them.\n\nFurthermore, design traits like the stray pieces of dyed hair, which provides eye-catching highlights, and the slightly crooked line often used to draw Marin's mouth or her nails,  give the show's character art a unique appeal beyond its outfits. Gojou and his grandpa being too aesthetically dull, despite the narrative justification, is the show's Achilles' heel. This is nonetheless made up for by the show's malleable supervision, which is not purely beholden to realism and can go off-the-rails for comedic moments, allowing even Gojou to elevate his appearance during his outbursts.",

This design diversity allows characters to have strong silhouettes; Bojji's in particular stands out due to the way in which he wears his crown. The characters look good in motion during fight scenes, with the bulkier characters in particular showing an impressive amount of volume.\n\nDespite these strengths, certain designs are rather forgettable, particularly Ozen's uninteresting armor. Clothing in general is rather plain, although it does have good basic colorwork. The show is also severely lacking in monster designs, with only one type of monster appearing in the show. One highlight in non-human designs, however, was Kage, whose cat burglar mask design creatively showed the shadow clan's abilities.\n\n*Ousama Ranking*'s character designs have a few weaker areas, but its strengths make for a charming and memorable cast of characters.",

The *Lycoris Recoil* designs are satisfyingly varied, both in terms of distinct silhouettes and making everyone feel instantly recognizable. The color coding is healthily balanced, primarily with the red and blue combinations in both of Chisato and Takina's cafe and DA uniforms.These aspects are enhanced by the show's varied and pleasing wardrobe even outside of those uniforms.\n\nCharacters like Chisato, thanks to her bright bold colors in clothing and hair, or the natural inclusion of black representation with Mika's character were met with acclaim. However, many other characters in *LycoReco* feature conventional and popular body types that don't differ much from standard anime tropes we might see elsewhere. For example, Takina's archetypical bishoujo long black hair appearance is one that's very popular in anime, and the show doesn't do enough to differentiate her too significantly from its contemporaries. Even if *LycoReco*'s consistency with this particular art style is admirable, the lack of variety in its animation direction is disappointing when compared to other entries in the Character Design category. \n\nThat being said, this consistency is what managed to make *LycoReco*'s designs so popular in the anime community.

The Devil Hunter uniforms are plain but sleek, and they are sufficiently varied. For example, Power's hoodie and Denji's rolled up sleeves do a good job of distinguishing the troublemakers. Kobeni is also a surprising standout, being quite bland (by design) but the way she carries herself and reacts like she is constantly full of anxiety and insecurity was perfect. There were a lot of small visual elements that were given a lot of care, like Aki's meditative routine or the attention given to the characters' eyes (Power and Makima in particular).\n\nThe Fiends and Devils themselves were at the extreme end of the highs and lows within the production. The Fox Devil, Tomato Devil, and the Angel Fiend all had a striking visual identity, but many like the Eternity Devil and Future Devil were less remarkable. *Chainsaw Man* also falters with its occasionally stilted facial animations, with a commitment to realism that often stifled much of the facial personality of the characters. There are some exceptions: Power is hilariously expressive when discussing the nuances of her Economic Policy.\n\n*Chainsaw Man* absolutely has magnificent standouts even within the entire category, but the hit or miss nature of nearly every design element of the show is a disappointment.

Bocchi's pink tracksuit and blue and yellow hair tie successfully work as an instantly recognizable design. The rest of the main cast, as well as some side characters like Hiroi, all feature very distinct choices when it comes to their hair, silhouettes and base outfits (especially the meme power of Nijika's dorito ahoge). The show also did not shy from freely morphing its main character into different shapes as means of enhancing comedy.\n\nAll this said, *Bocchi* generally doesn't utilize its designs in properly fun ways outside of that. The simple straightforward linework of the characters gets tiresome during more uneventful scenes.

          "writeup": "With legendary animator Yoh Yoshinari at the helm, *Cyberpunk Edgrerunners* exhibits some of his wildest and most appealing character designs yet.\nThe cast features a wide array of designs: unique angular designs with good shapes, strong silhouettes, and good color design that aid their distinguishability.\n\nMaine and Dorio's boxier designs give them a more hulking presence, while Lucy and Kiwi's lanky rectangular designs accentuate specific features like their legs or hips. Rebecca's more pear-shaped build shows the imbalance between her stature and movement.\n\nThe color choices are excellent at visually distinguishing character personalities. Lucy's silver hair demonstrates her lone wolf personality, and the hues of blue in David's popped collar showcase his sincerity and earnestness. This can even extend to character rimlights such as bathing Faraday in hot pink to give him a domineering aura when speaking to Maine.\n\nWhile the designs exhibit a lot of personality, clothing variation/body modification are mostly nonexistent aside from David and Rebecca's modifications that structurally change their shaping. There also exists some overlap in body shape between a few secondary characters such as Pillar and RipperDoc.\n\nDespite these minor issues, the designs are also quite adaptable to variations from several animation directors. Perhaps the most engaging of which is Kai Ikarashi's radical departure from the show's more orderly shapes and neon-adjacent rimlighting, towards a heavily angular and highly saturated approach to reflect the severity of cyberpsychosis.\n\nOverall, *Cyberpunk* features some of the most highly distinguished and fun designs of the year, making its diversity in shape philosophy a highlight in the category.",

So much so that no single nominee quite demonstrates the full spectrum of what 2022 had to offer.  Fall was the strongest season of the year, with long awaited sequels in *Mob* and *Yama no Susume*, surprise hits in *DIY* and *Bocchi the Rock*, and a less surprising hit in *Chainsaw Man*. In fact, only two nominees, *Kaguya* and *Healer Girl*, were from Winter, Spring, or Summer proper. *86 Part 2* was mostly last year, and *YTMB* and *Cyberpunk* were late summer streaming drops.    This selection puts action, drama, slice of life, and comedy shows side-by-side, all with their own styles of cinematography to highlight their strengths. The category covers a variety of material, from lighting and color design to shot composition and editing, and strong examples of each element are easy to find:  - Creative and comedic storyboarding was a huge part of the category this year, perhaps most notable in returnee *Kaguya* and first-timer *Bocchi the Rock*. - Meanwhile *Mob*, *Chainsaw Man*, and *Cyberpunk* featured their own flavors of action and dramatic boarding side-by-side. - *Time Machine Blues*, *Cyberpunk: Edgerunners*, and *Do It Yourself* are all examples of excellent lighting and color design, but all in completely different ways. - *86: Part 2* was the king of symbolism and blocking, while *Healer Girl*, *Yama no Susume*, and *Bocchi the Rock* all employ complex layouts with great ease.  None of these examples are exhaustive, instead they all point to the breadth of cinematographic elements we looked at this year and how much each of these nominees has to offer.",

          "writeup": "*Yama no Susume: Next Summit* distinguishes itself with incredible commitment to its various settings and well-constructed emotional moments throughout. The season serves as the final victory lap for Aoi's development, elevated through the scope of a plethora of cinematographic techniques.\n\nAnalogously to previous seasons, each episode of the show takes on a unique visual flavor depending on the episode director, resulting in a veritable cornucopia of styles and techniques. From Keiichiro Saito's [harmoniously lit New Years' sunrise](https://i.imgur.com/L2UgXtG.jpeg) that elevates Aoi's determination in 7a, to Yusuke Yamamoto's awe-inspiring use of [perspective](https://i.imgur.com/Pg6c5sc.jpeg) and [the bubbles signifying transience](https://imgur.com/a/0NoKXbP) in 6a, to *China*'s [ethereal compositing](https://i.imgur.com/Ga1zDkZ.jpeg) and [novel framing of a flashback](https://i.imgur.com/IsZRpvx.jpeg) in 7b, the show is a treat for the eyes from start to finish. Furthermore, the storyboarding itself often allows an [incredible amount of depth](https://i.imgur.com/bZhkw5p.jpeg) to be displayed in the environments. Characters move believably through the densely-composited scenes. These more intricate settings are ultimately juxtaposed in the final episode's [sparse layouts conveying the motif of the sky](https://i.imgur.com/ESPIKRf.jpeg), as the finally clear-headed Aoi ascends to the summit.\n\nDespite this, the show presents a few visual inconsistencies. Notably, episodes 8 and 11 feel as though they are a cut below the rest with some duller storyboarding and a more lackadaisical composite accompanied by the filtered photo backgrounds. *Yama no Susume: Next Summit*'s strengths far outweigh the few negatives though, providing a satisfying cinematographic experience throughout.

          "writeup": "*Do It Yourself* leverages the sum of its consistent parts to create an aesthetically- pleasing product that impresses with a multitude of different cinematographic techniques. Much of the praise for *DIY* lies within its incredible attention to [composite](https://i.imgur.com/WUViQMr.jpg) and [color-matching](https://i.imgur.com/5PvHks5.jpeg) throughout, with which it is able to carefully craft the tone of a scene. True to its namesake, *DIY* implements a soft, almost [“crinkled paper” texture](https://i.imgur.com/lSCEj53.jpeg) on its backgrounds, further lending to the show's themes of the beauty in little imperfections. \n\nDespite the strong attention to the handcrafted aesthetic, *DIY* certainly doesn't skimp on visual symbolism or bold creative endeavors.For example, Purin's reflection on her attitude in episode 4 was conveyed with [intimate framing](https://i.imgur.com/L6FtmSs.jpg) throughout and her tsun personality began to melt as the walls hushed further in. Further, the show is peppered with ambitious shots throughout, such as the [dramatic use of shadows](https://i.imgur.com/SvfZz1K.jpg) to shroud Shii in mystery, the incredibly intricate layouts present in several of [Yua's daydreams](https://i.imgur.com/3LRz0LF.jpeg), or the stunning compositing that allows [Ren Onodera's idiosyncrasies](https://i.imgur.com/7xB4JJJ.mp4) to flourish onto Yua's bicycle ride.\n\nPraises being sung, the show slows down in the latter half with more standard shot-reverse shots and a shortage of key visual motifs like the aforementioned daydreams.

          "writeup": "*Healer Girl* is the latest passion project from Irie Yasuhiro and it reflects his growing penchant for musicality. Channeling his enthusiasm, Irie actually storyboarded all twelve episodes by himself. Therefore, it's no surprise that *Healer Girl*'s strength lies in its storyboarding and layouts.\n\n\nThe show regularly utilizes complex layouts that [emphasize depth and interesting perspectives](https://i.imgur.com/yttO3IW.mp4). The shot composition easily frames the cast from natural angles that focus on clarity and readability. In addition, [sequences of clever cuts](https://i.imgur.com/aCw4tPI.mp4) will deftly lead the viewer through the setting, with an uncommon sense of continuity. Similarly, *Healer Girl* features a [strong sense of tempo and musicality](https://i.imgur.com/VLQmXDO.mp4) in the editing, punctuating comedic bits and dramatic beats alike, perfect for a show about singing.\n\nUnfortunately, the production as a whole did not always impress. The composite generally reinforced the variety of layouts, but was less successful at bringing together the characters, effects and backgrounds into a cohesive whole. Similarly, the color palette was fairly pedestrian; the characters and settings occasionally clashed, while the colors during the healing images were frequently garish and distracting. At the end of the day, while the baseline for storyboarding was decently high, *Healer Girl* doesn't have many memorable peaks. That high baseline however, represents a diligent emphasis on storyboarding fundamentals that many shows could emulate. ",

          "writeup": "*Yojouhan Time Machine Blues* picks up from where its cult classic predecessor left off. Its [core aesthetic](https://i.imgur.com/q4QksDF.jpg) of flatly-shaded characters presented atop distinct monochromatic backgrounds is made for casually delivering striking shots with stunning contrast and visual clarity. While there's not a lot of motivated lighting, what is there is impressive; the [textured gradient of the book-fair lights](https://i.imgur.com/p12D1rO.jpg) is simply lovely. Even with the more limited setting compared to the original, *Time Machine Blues* keeps things fresh by constantly switching up camera angles to present its locations. This comes in handy when the gang visits locations that are also inhabited by their past versions, as it can have oblique wide shots that accommodate the present and the past at once.\n\nWhile its static compositions are consistently gorgeous, the show doesn't rest its laurels on that aspect, as it also features some dynamic camera work. The frankly absurd [tracking shot of Watashi running out of a closet](https://i.imgur.com/j8d6QFr.mp4) is the biggest highlight in this department. Another standout feature is its usage of surreal compositing to deliver jokes, notably the [straight-up live-action prop of the dirt-covered packaged air-conditioner remote which they dig out of a swamp.](https://i.imgur.com/DIUXM65.jpg)\n\nThe final epilogue episode is a distinct highlight even amidst the show's high benchmark as it runs a unique visual metaphor for the friend group: train tracks disconnecting as they feud and reconnecting as they make up, ultimately seeding the impetus of the events of the first five episodes.",

This season, he was more active than ever, having storyboarded a whopping six and a half episodes.

Yuzuru Tachikawa and Yoshimichi Kameda's absence from central positions on the product contribute towards the beloved eccentric presentation and splash frames taking a back seat this season.

The lighting is similarly standout, featuring rimlighting that effortlessly gels with the overall aesthetic and further serves to create meaning throughout the work, most clearly seen in the [kiss scene in episode 4](https://i.imgur.com/uz5mNAn.mp4) and the cold open that links [David](https://i.imgur.com/SHSSEY9.jpg) and [James Norris](https://i.imgur.com/d7U8JUL.jpg).

There are some incredibly effective montages, particularly the paired montages of [David's walk](https://i.imgur.com/tsXg0tI.mp4) to and from home in episode 1. The edit uses both clean transitions to create thematic or narrative continuity between scenes and jarring transitions to emphasize weakening grasp on reality as characters [lose themselves to cyberpsychosis](https://i.imgur.com/1YAL7Ts.mp4).

          "writeup": "*Bocchi the Rock* may primarily be a comedy, as evident by its many out-of-the-box gags presented in diverse styles. However, its director Keichiro Saito, also sees a potent bildungsroman at the heart of this flamboyant exterior; he consistently frames Bocchi within [spatially deep layouts](https://i.imgur.com/BI7yeI0.jpg) that emphasize her anxiety and isolation at every moment. Visual symbolism, such as [Bocchi's ball falling out of her class' pack](https://i.imgur.com/0VUmx1T.jpg) or the physical manifestation of the gap between [a loner like Ryo](https://i.imgur.com/byxrC13.jpg) and [an outcast like Bocchi](https://i.imgur.com/IF2IYgD.jpg), furthers this examination of her anxiety in an effective manner.\n\nBesides Saito himself, two other storyboarders made a splash with their work on the show. The first was Yusuke Kawakami, who was also the show's live performance director. He made it his mission to present the concerts in the most glamorous way possible, from the [guitar head-mounted GoPro shots](https://i.imgur.com/6LpK7J3.jpg) to the [stylized lighting in the street performance](https://i.imgur.com/OlBepw1.jpg). The second was Yusuke Yamamoto, who was responsible for the most outrageous mixed media gags in the show: [Bocchi's identity balloon popping](https://i.imgur.com/6LpK7J3.jpg), the [popsicle Greek chorus](https://i.imgur.com/n14M2r0.jpg), [Darwin Kita](https://i.imgur.com/XsMDnLP.jpg), and [Bocchi's devolution into a Blender model](https://i.imgur.com/YhsvtRx.jpg).\n\nUnfortunately, the show begins to lose steam after the high of the band's first concert in episode 8. Hiroi's concert in episode 10 puts on an unconvincing psychedelic act, while episode 9 has severe issues in [compositing its photographic backgrounds](https://imgur.com/a/iTiRNyy) and a lack of creative gags. This lackluster last third hinders what was otherwise one of the most avant-garde productions in recent memory.",

The changes in these scenes hammer home the difference in mood between the two parts with their [contrasting visual metaphors](https://imgur.com/a/gGzGB3m).  \n\n*Part 2* loses the dichotomy between Lena and the Spearhead Squadron in its storyboarding present in the first season. This season however does carve out an identity for itself with a number of strong conversations mostly featuring Shinei, namely the ones with [Frederica](https://i.imgur.com/roTKVZr.jpg) and [Raiden](https://i.imgur.com/8K6gM8L.jpg), in episodes 15 and 20 respectively. These scenes utilize meaningful blocking and lighting to enhance their impact. But even with these highs, an equal amount of scenes don't use these tools to the same level.\n\nThe show's [action boards](https://i.imgur.com/HxRftDs.mp4) also leave much to be desired. They are overly frenetic in their pacing, with blindingly fast jump cuts and pivots that severely hurt the readability during fights. There are also a number of compositing issues with the CG smoke, spark effects and even the robots themselves, all of which hurt the readability even more.\n\nEpisode 22, which was handled by the series director Toshimaso Ishii himself, is the best of the entire show with its [innovative usage of aspect ratios](https://i.imgur.com/0ficSGv.mp4) and [strong color identity arising from its use of flowers](https://i.imgur.com/hR10Iwo.mp4).

          "writeup": "*Chainsaw Man* famously goes for a “cinematic” approach, but that is a fairly broad term. It can mean the fast cutting and dynamic lighting found in grindhouse works, which Tatsuki Fujimoto uses as touchstones, or it can mean the more realistic approach to lighting and muted color grading commonplace in modern blockbusters. Ryu Nakayama interprets the word as the latter, and it does work to a degree. Scenes like [Aki's morning routine](https://i.imgur.com/Pvfjoyk.jpg) in episode 4 have involved lighting that creates a fantastic reverie or the amorous tension between Makima and Denji's in episode 5 which is captured by the [intimate closeups to their hands](https://i.imgur.com/IRH3ji9.jpg).\n\nHowever, most of the time, the show just [haphazardly applies shallow depth-of-field](https://i.imgur.com/Y2haiTn.jpg) to every shot, to the point where even [shifting racking focus](https://i.imgur.com/e0s576C.mp4) stops commanding attention. The handheld camera movements are ambitious, even if their execution is inconsistent, like [episode 5's goofy hallway chase](https://i.imgur.com/2biuYDD.mp4). Furthermore, the show's palette is overwhelmingly gray except for welcome respites like the blue color grading for Himeno and Denji's night-out.\n\nThe action boarding can be messy, with fights like the dimly lit [Denji vs Infinity Devil being hard to read](https://i.imgur.com/5KgCV1N.mp4), or the climactic [Denji vs Katana with its wonky perspectives](https://imgur.com/a/dAPtBKx). But there are notable exceptions to this trend, with the fights boarded by Tatsuya Yoshihara standing out thanks to their usage of triple takes that emphasize their visceral impact.\nOverall, *Chainsaw Man* showcases an ambitious, if flawed, attempt to capture cinematic stylizations in anime, which has earned it a lot of deserving fans.",

These include the soundtracks of *CHIMIMO* with its whimsical contrast between idyllic tracks featuring naturalistic timbres and heavy metal, *BLEACH: Sennen Kessen-hen* with its reimagining of classic tracks and new orchestral peaks, and *Healer Girl* with its unique premise as an anime musical.  Every nominee in the category excelled in very different ways and the jury considered a wide range of aspects when discussing soundtracks. *Chainsaw Man* and *Edgerunners* both had great action tracks, but their approach to the more ambient and dramatic music was very different, with *Edgerunners* recontextualizing trashy pop songs and *Chainsaw Man* being far more eclectic. With the opposite approach, *Yama no Susume* had extremely low-key songs that were so perfectly mixed that they felt grafted onto the show themselves. The biggest factor for the top nominees this year was how effectively the soundtracks elevated the themes of the shows themselves, with *Edgerunners*’s songs resonating with themes of individualism and general ‘punk’ vibes, and *Chainsaw Man*’s OST accentuating the emotional depth of its dramatic characters.",

          "writeup": "*Akebi-chan no Sailor Fuku* is unparalleled in widespread instrumental simplicity, predominantly featuring only piano and strings across its original soundtrack. *Akebi*'s OST greatly assists the character exploration of the titular Akebi Komichi and the cast, through the compositional variations of “Komichi's Theme” that are prevalent through a majority of the OST tracks. The tracks borrow melody lines, rhythmic phrasing, harmonic layering, all in creative arrangement hearkening to baroque era composition. This further characterizes Akebi's multifaceted self, in that through her evolving experiences, her identity of self is more strongly reinforced.\n\nTo further complement the instrumental simplicity, the leading role within OST tracks is not dominated as a whole by piano, nor strings. This creates an engaging experience, as well as an effective flow throughout the show, when combined with frequent application of call and response. Further balance is attained through pensive piano and strings solos, in moments of quiet introspection. These instrumental factors combine well with Erika's musical repertoire being diegetically matching. \n\nDespite the compositional excellence the *Akebi* OST exhibits, its setbacks come from its tailor-made approach for the work. The specificity of tracks to align with events on screen create strong musical remnants tied to the narrative in memory, but as such can leave less of an impression should these moments fail to resonate with the viewer. \n\nNonetheless, *Akebi*'s uniquely *Akebi* OST is a pleasure to experience while watching and rewatching.

For *Ousama Ranking*, MAYUKO took these elements and elevated them in various ways, bringing forth a product that is still quite reminiscent of these settings, while also crafting its own defined experience.\n\nAs expected from TV anime production soundtracks, *Ousama Ranking*'s boasts a wide variety of tracks, varying from emotional and general mood setting tracks, to character specific themes, as well as a plethora of thrilling action pieces. These all work wonderfully in the show, tightly mixed within their scenes to elevate the material without retracting from the vocal performances. Having worked alongside the likes of Kenichiro Suehiro; a previous Awards favorite, their trained experience in creating strongly guiding melodies shines through, particularly in the highlight character themes such as Bojji's “King's Sword”, Hiling's “Determination Concerto”, or Ouken's “Shivering”.\n\nWhile *Ousama Ranking* excels in its depiction of the setting and establishing of moods, it lacks in significant risk-taking endeavors and eccentric elements that help craft a distinct and truly exceptional experience. Despite that, *Ousama Ranking* still holds up incredibly well all things considered, delivering a grand and fantastical experience that would make anyone want to join Bojji and his friends along on their epic journey.",

          "writeup": "The supernatural world of *Mob Psycho 100 III* is weird, quirky, confusing, and often uncomfortable or downright scary, and throughout every season the OST is one of the primary ways this is communicated. Even within the wide variety of soundtracks this year, the focus on Japanese traditional instruments like the chimes, Hyoshigi, and Koto are both unique and resonate deeply with the unmistakably culturally Japanese supernatural elements. \n\n\nProbably the strongest way that the OST is used within the context of the show is how it establishes the foundational vibe of Reigen. The common faux-intensity of many of the tracks (fast paced and heavily percussive) does a great job of emphasizing his general ‘trickster' persona and vaguely sleazy vibe.\n\nOne of the drawbacks of *Season III* is how there are a small amount of new tracks. Even if the new ones are all strong, the majority of tracks were reused from previous seasons. There are some scenes where this reuse was handled perfectly, like when they tie in the OP from the first season during a climactic moment involving Reigen and Mob, but many of the tracks are not used in particularly interesting or new contexts that add a lot to the show. While the reuse of older tracks feels repetitive and dulls the impact compared to previous seasons, the soundtrack of *Mob Psycho 100 III* is a crucial aspect of the show's ability to convey its weird and quirky supernatural world.",

          "writeup": "The soundtrack of *Shingeki no Kyojin: The Final Season Part 2* plays a crucial role in establishing the series' dark and intense atmosphere. The music is predominantly orchestral, with sweeping strings, pounding drums, powerful brass instruments, choral and electronic elements which lay the foundation for the show's tense and ominous atmosphere. Particularly notable is the incorporation of diegetic sounds, such as the clock ticking in Episode 7 or the metallic clink of the machinery, and the constant percussive backing of the wall titans' march. Some of the impactful tracks from previous seasons are also used to good effect, such as Sawano's “[Barricades](https://open.spotify.com/track/6iaQi9uPzHoXLMo5g490Bj?si=c3bda903a4424a85)” during a crucial battle scene.\n\nAlthough it showcases some creative instrumentation and good use of transitions, it sometimes struggles to create thematic or emotional weight. The show rarely has outrightly tonally dissonant tracks during dramatic moments, but many of the tracks during these scenes do not stand out at all and have very little impact on the scenes themselves. And although some of the individual tracks used for the more intense moments are strong, the nuance for many tracks is lost amidst the many loud sound effects and shouting. While the soundtrack as a whole does a good job of maintaining a consistent theme and has standout elements, the soundtrack of *Shingeki no Kyojin: The Final Season Part 2* falls short of the incredible musical excellence from the other nominees.

The OST also contains many synthetic overtures that magnify the emotional and dramatic moments of the series. The “Sweet Dreams” track in particular is reused to excellent effect, with the echoing sound of the bells creating a haunting leitmotif used throughout the show. \n\nThe creative tracks are not only compositionally exceptional, but are also precisely utilized to elevate the show. The two biggest standouts are the way the ethereal synths and powerful string melody combine to underscore the intense emotional connection during Power's flashback with “[Living Room](https://open.spotify.com/track/1C8sLnhckOv6cU29nwDXxQ?si=52d2008aeee14334)” or the way the haunting “[Sweet Dreams](https://open.spotify.com/track/0fDAbYbqfFzY7JXhmfJqGR?si=5f27459164e346d5)” is used during climactic moments to highlight the themes of loss and tragedy. *Chainsaw Man* also expertly uses silence to underscore key moments throughout its episodes. The show strikes a delicate balance between hyperviolence, dark humor, and character-driven drama, and is elevated beyond the sum of its thematic elements due to the soundtrack's ability to communicate complex emotions. The soundtrack is all over the place, but every place the soundtrack brings you to is a new peak.",

However, *Cyberpunk: Edgerunners* doesn't just integrate its scenes into the music perfectly, but also manages to recontextualize their usage, presenting a new gold standard for what is even possible for an anime OST to do in this regard.\n\nWhile there are some new tracks composed by Akira Yamaoka used in small doses in the series, the standouts are inserts originally used in the *Cyberpunk 2077* video game. They were found on the in-game radio, not tied to specific events, characters, or locations in Night City. That's certainly not the case now, thanks to the anime personalizing the usage of these tracks to an unbelievable degree. “I Really Want to Stay at Your House” became the anthem of Lucy and David as a couple, “Zurawie” is now forever tied to the pivotal events involving David and Maine in episode six, and “Who's Ready For Tomorrow” is an anthem for the rough everyday experiences of Night City's less fortunate inhabitants. Each track is synced up perfectly with both the animation and emotional fluctuations of their scenes, creating an essentially perfect level of cohesion.\n\nAnother strength of the OST is the colossal range of atmospheres and emotions it can cover due to featuring so many genres. Despite this, it is still brought together as one cohesive whole that isn't at odds with itself.

As with the first season, his richly-layered tracks serve as the foundation of much of the show's worldbuilding. Synths are used in a variety of ways to turn seemingly familiar instrumentation into something otherworldly, echoing the alien biome that is the abyss existing among a more standard setting. Additionally, multiple melody lines are frequently layered together to create [a lush soundscape](https://open.spotify.com/track/17zo72OcCXkmNdOyeNp0vC?si=e737397898e84142) which brings the environment of the abyss to vibrant life.\n\nWhile the tracks themselves are consistently fine-tuned to enhance the atmosphere of the series, the same can't be said about the mixing. Tracks are occasionally quickly faded out before their scene is finished, leaving the rest of the scene unnecessarily empty and less vibrant than it otherwise would have been. Additionally, some transitions between tracks are noticeably abrupt, pushing one out clumsily before it had fulfilled its purpose in the scene.\n\nFor an OST that is mainly intended to enhance the show's worldbuilding through the atmosphere it creates, it's also surprisingly versatile. Specific tracks such as [Old Stories](https://open.spotify.com/track/5FHMiH3xAfrD8TN86wgYp1?si=39a4afb5ab7849a1) and [Mallets of Abyss](https://open.spotify.com/track/381WdOo4QVOcR5Yq28UkLj?si=ab90bbbe37714df2) are brought in multiple times, always at moments of significant emotional or narrative importance, tying these key moments together.\n\nOverall, Penkin successfully manages to build on the already strong elements of the first season of the show, without it becoming stale.",

          "writeup": "*Bocchi the Rock!* offers a familiar take on band-centric slice of life shows, with phenomenal comedic timing and markers of personal growth at its core. Immediately recognisable for the original soundtrack are the inexperienced on-stage performances of Kessoku Band, and more seasoned SICK HACK. The performances of Kessoku Band effectively show their developing synergy and band identity, from clear mistakes in musical execution hampering impactfulness, to growing in competency, confidence, and identity. To their detriment, the rate of progression for Kessoku Band beggars belief - with composition quality of their original pieces sounding more similar to studio professional tracks than high-school musicians. SICK HACK's feature performance starkly contrasts Kessoku Band with a psychedelic rock song, enhanced by the high level of polish in performance.  \n\n*Bocchi the Rock!* also features instrumentation to excellently support character theming, with mellow wandering guitar riffs filling the background outside of comedic skits. These work nicely as tie-ins to the guitar-mad band members of Bocchi, Ryou, and Hiroi especially. However, their presence is overshadowed by the prevalence and wide variance of single-use comedic tracks. The music direction of the OST for comedic timing is by far the biggest asset the show has to offer. From toy instruments, to children's choir, to classic record-scratch worthy interruptions, the OST is essential in assisting the multitude of third wall breaks. \n\n*Bocchi the Rock!* falls short in replicating realism for some stage performances, but is a treat to watch for its breadth of musical exploration and comedic qualities..",

Jurors who hadn't even known of the existence of particular performances prior to the awards became some of the staunchest proponents of those nominees, and what had initially been a fairly brief shortlist page eventually ballooned with an excess of worthy nominees. This meant that many noteworthy performances didn't even make it to the finalist stage in the category, despite enjoying positive support from the majority of the jury. There simply weren't anywhere close to enough slots for all of the nominees who deserved recognition for their performances. In the end, the surplus of outstanding nominees led to the jurors coming together in multiple bouts of highly-involved discussion to form a consensus.

On top of that, the performance tends to be loud overall and tonally static if Akebi isn't explicitly trying to be quiet. Akebi doesn't really change over the course of the show, which results in a vocal performance that's static from episode one.

Kurokawa isn't a Disney villain that ruminates with unnecessary soliloquy. When he is playing cards, he is just a man having a good time. You can hear the scenes where he is genuinely having fun and enjoying himself. In these scenes he still sounds gruff, but his intonation is slightly more relaxed, with a slightly faster pace indicating his more casual attitude. He feels genuinely dangerous as a villain because he is so powerfully humanized by Tsuda's decision to portray Kurokawa as multifaceted instead of always trying to put on a ‘face' of the villain.  \nThe only significant setback for this performance is that a lot of the impeccable nuance Tsuda brings to the role falls apart somewhat during the climactic episodes of the show, sounding more robotic and missing his subtly menacing undertones. Despite this blemish, he manages to stand out as one of the strongest performances of the year.",

Her detailed acting is apparent from the start, and she adapts and grows the performance as Takina experiences tremendous change throughout the show. With a stunning finale wrought with emotion and intensity, Wakamiya shows why there are two bright lights in the Lycoris sky.\n\nIt's easy to point to Wakamiya's blow-away acting towards the end of *Lycoris Recoil* as Takina screams and cries to save her beloved friend and call it a day. However, Wakamiya approaches Takina with a lot of subtlety and care even in episode one. As a quiet character, Takina is brought to life not from words alone but through the careful inflection, breathing, and tonal choices that Wakamiya brings into the acting. The subtlety slowly transforms into clearer aspects of her character as Takina changes from an emotionless soldier to a caring friend.\n\nThat said, Takina still ends up being a second fiddle in her own show. A lot of her monotonous and quiet acting works out due to reflecting the radiant energy of Chisato, and she struggles to stand out in scenes without her partner. Her quiet persona also means that even as she's being changed by Chisato, her pitch profile remains constrained and limited to retain that personality. Though she's one of the best performances of the year, she'll have to settle for being the setting moon to the rising sun.",

Hanae maintains Vanitas' grandiose theatrical presence in *Part 2*, and further explores his character through expressive moments of vulnerability, uncertainty, and breaks in his outwardly narcissistic facade.\nHanae tailors his performance in *Part 2* to show the gradual - but inevitable - changes in Vanitas as the show progresses, especially in contrast to *Part 1*. Building on the established persona, Hanae further incorporates minor mannerisms from Jeanne and Noé as Vanitas inevitably becomes closer to them. Similarly, Hanae prompts Vanitas in another direction when conversing with the cast. Instead of solely controlling dialogue with his grandiose presence, as he did in *Part 1*, Vanitas loosens his grip on conversation this season and permits other characters opportunities to dictate its emotional direction.\nFurther growth in Vanitas' character is revealed when Hanae chooses to drop the theatrical facade for brief moments. He precisely squeezes out key phrases in a pained manner, grunts in surprise, and inserts breaths of frustration in places he would usually try to hide his temperament. Hanae shows exceptional adaptability in these instances, making these momentary drops of Vanitas' facade believable as coming from the same character who usually insists on a grandiose speaking style. \n\nIn the end, Hanae manages to consistently pull off the difficult feat of building on and elevating an already stellar performance, instead of settling for what he had already previously established.

Instead of being just a standard love interest, Suguta's Marin becomes a coequal main character who broadens the audience's view of her relationship with Gojo. We don't just witness what Gojo feels or finds appealing about Marin, we also get to see these interactions more comprehensively, thanks to Suguta's candid inner reactions for the audience.\nPart of what makes the performance so effective in its humanizing of Marin is that it consistently walks a fine line between retaining some of the surface-level characteristics of the character without reducing her to a shallow trope. Suguta's Marin is unashamed of being a gal, and isn't trying to hide it, but that's also not what she's largely defined by. There's nothing surface level about the performance though –  Suguta uses a small amount of consistent mannerisms while adding to them a wide variety of emotional expressions that flesh Marin out as a fully-realized character. Unfortunately for Suguta, Marin is offered few opportunities to truly push boundaries and exhibit the limits of her audacity, as much as other nominees were able to this year.  \nIn the end, Hina Suguta shows a lot of promise by going above and beyond in her portrayal of Marin, hopefully portending more outstanding performances from her in the future.",

Add on his cocky and unchained persona as the titular *Chainsaw Man* and you've got a performance that's a truly revolutionary piece of work.\n\nThe most distinctive thing about Denji's voice is his drawl. Toya slurs his syllables, slows his pace, and maintains an upbeat and positive tone to carve an ideal voice for Denji to sound as dumb as possible. While he's usually a bumbling buffoon, Denji has moments of contemplation and brooding which Toya slides into seamlessly. The range that Toya demonstrates going from existential pondering about groping boobs to screaming in murderous delight as he shreds into his enemies is sublime.\n\nHowever, in this cutthroat category, there are several ways Denji falls short compared to his peers. For one, Denji experiences little emotional change and never showcases genuine grief or sadness in his performance, making it tug less on the heartstrings, particularly in emotional scenes. Additionally, his unchanging personality also means his vocal performance is less reactive and does not adapt to the scene or situation - instead he sounds pretty much the same all the time. Even still, Denji's engaging and recognizable voice is enough to carve him a solid spot in our top performances of the year.",

There's no question that she deserves to be recognized as one of the best performances in 2022.\n\nFaputa is a genuine monster born from a miracle in the horrors of the abyss. Kuno goes to great lengths using various noises, grunts, and her trademark nasal tones to convey Faputa's animalistic nature. On top of that, Faputa's excitable and intense personality means that Kuno is constantly shrilling, screaming, and going all out in these scenes to convey extreme amounts of emotion.\n\nWhile she's certainly a stellar performance, Faputa also has the most glaring weaknesses compared to the rest of the category. The intensity of the performance isn't always upheld, and her normal speech often comes off as emotionless and static. The necessity of the verbal tic, aka “gobi”, means that the ways Kuno structures her sentences and specifically the options she has for conveying emotion is unvaried and repetitive. In any given scene, Faputa rarely transitions between moods and remains one-dimensional during her time on-screen.

But later in the same scene when Anya is trying to be manipulative, her delivery is much different, drawing out her words to sound cute and helpless. Tanezaki ensures Anya is not good at hiding her intentions vocally, which perfectly suits the poor lying abilities characteristic of young kids. \nUnfortunately, her performance takes a while to find its groove. There are definitely standouts early on, but she does not fall into a consistently comfortable delivery in the show until the second cour. Another problem was with Anya's limited dialogue, where she participates mostly in fractured conversations with a lot of silence.

Examples include eating lunch on the train with Takina, the way she answers her phone in episode six, and even during the more emotional dialogues in the last few episodes. \nAnzai integrates Chisato's professional life with her personal life seamlessly, keeping her vocal mannerisms consistent in both worlds. Her ability to change tone and inflection within conversation elevates Chisato from being merely a high energy “Genki Girl”, to always coming across as effortlessly charismatic and never annoying.

This can be seen in the picture freakout scene in episode four, as she goes from: letting her voice trail off recounting Bocchi's limited experience with having her picture taken; to increasing the speed and pitch of her voice when Bocchi likens herself to a mythical Tsuchinoko; to recreating a static whine in a way almost beyond plausibility for the human voice.\nAoyama's intricate applications of vocal control persist throughout the show, as Bocchi's over-the-top reactions and noises never become stale. One particularly effective tool she employed to keep the reactions fresh was her consistent breath control, as variations in her breathing were a large element of portraying the nuances of Bocchi's social anxiety. Sometimes squeezed out in defeat, in other instances added to words to emphasize her excitement, Aoyama's breaths were consistently a telltale sign of Bocchi's emotional state at any given point\nIn the end, Yoshino Aoyama's highly technical performance as Bocchi allowed the character to be both sympathetic and relatable instead of falling into simple tropes regarding severe social anxiety.",

Various topics such as composition, referential imagery, lyrical integration, chord progression, foreshadowing, narrative cohesion, and credit integration were judged over the process of the awards, which is well reflected on the wealth of support opening director Shingo Yamashita received through three of his entries receiving nominations. Other standouts within the category included the boarding and character animation of ”Omoi Nochi Hare”, the efficient exploration of the anxiety in ”Seishun Complex”, and the shifting aesthetical styles within ”Mixed Nuts” along with the relevance those styles hold for the opening’s narrative.  Each of the nominations had their advocates, but it was clear early on that the three Shingo Yamashita productions were going to stand atop the category. Ultimately the adventurous and emotional epic of ”Hadaka no Yuusha” charmed the jury with its beautiful production values and multitude of coinciding storylines, transcending the striking referential imagery of ”KICK BACK” and the character exploration of ”Aiue”.",

From Toshiyuki Satou's incredibly [dynamic cut of Hinata](https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/976044cb427e02dd5020c0c7645d0cc8.mp4), Ryousuke Shinkai's [boisterous cut of Koharu](https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/a8dc41645b35b2641a0053d1b48e3b33.mp4), toYuuta Kiso's [point-of-view shots](https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/a34f99a67777e6489cb5ef601b4d4257.mp4), the opening steps on the gas pedal and doesn't let off for the entirety of its runtime. In addition to this careful attention to visual production, the opening also features meaningful thematic relevance in its visuals. Modest shots such as Aoi's walking stick from her incomplete Mount Fuji climb take on entirely new meaning within the narrative importance in the show.\n\nWhile there are many impressive visual details, the opening feels shallow at points with sequences of Aoi simply walking home with her friends.

The second half is also less impressive in that aspect, for the tonal shift breaks the allure of the visuals that it held in the first half. Though *DIY* remained less impressive in these regards, it is anything but makeshift as the OP welded together its mechanical precision with its colorful adolescent determination—fitting as well as Serufu and Purin.",

It is only fitting that for a reboot with such a strong legacy behind it, that Lum's return is announced like she had never left at all. Just one viewing of “Aiue” makes it abundantly clear that Lum is inescapable for Ataru but also inescapable for the viewer.\n\nAlmost every shot that doesn't feature Lum has her taking it over later on. From retro games like Space Invaders to modern apps like Tinder, she takes center stage everywhere. Sequences such as the endless staircase or roller coaster push Lum's inescapable presence even further, as she continues up in scale to take over a concert too. In every shot, Lum steals the show with her infectious charisma. Amidst fully lit neon cityscapes, Lum is still at the center of attention.\n\nThe song is upbeat and catchy and does a good job at reeling it in before letting loose once Lum takes the stage. The visuals do go a bit overboard at times however, the lighting in particular has a few shots that go beyond stunning and into blinding. Despite some fumbles with the execution, every single aspect of “Aiue” catches your attention and refuses to let go, and is rightfully fitting for the great return of *Urusei Yatsura*.",

          "writeup": "Much like the show itself, \"Mixed Nuts\" combines action-packed espionage with domestic slice of life to make a compelling case for why that concept works. By employing a diverse spread of visual styles, this opening is able to showcase a wide range of moments, from explosive car chases to quiet family outings, in a way that is both engaging and at times uplifting. Combined with the bass-heavy, jazz-infused instrumentation and strong vocal performance of the song, the entire experience takes on an air of adventure and mystery that synergizes perfectly with the show.\n\nHowever, while this opening's broader concept is definitely appropriate, it has issues with its execution that are difficult to overlook. In particular, there is an overall imbalance in how much screen time each art style receives, with the lengthy \"picturebook\" sequence following Anya seeming to disproportionately dominate the opening's runtime. This leaves many of the other art styles underutilized, such as the high-contrast noir scene at the start, and risks making some moments appear disjointed from the rest rather than complimentary. As a result, this opening becomes a bit of a mixed bag, with many fantastic individual parts that become less so once you put them together. Still, despite these issues, its many visual and musical strengths remain apparent as effective reflections of the show in general.",

          "writeup": "”Daten” has quite a few things going for it, namely: the aesthetic being top notch, the emphasized words popping up into the foreground of the opening, and the song being insanely catchy and memorable. The lyrics “Falling, Falling” are continually stuck in your head, and the opening provides you with a narrative throughline as the characters quite literally are falling through a good portion of the opening. The transitions between sequences and music synchronization are also top notch, easily some of the best of the year. Color choices are great and it is animated relatively well, with slick choreography during the dance moves and very smooth lineart quality. The backgrounds are also quite attractive and change relatively frequently as sequences transition.\n\nThe biggest issue for *Daten* was inarguably due to the middle portion of the opening being a bit too drawn out and long, with not much happening as the two main characters float around in the sky.\n\nThe third wall gets broken down, as it shows the cast watching the opening being created before they start falling down in line with the structure of the opening previously. The character introductions during this portion of the opening were quite slick, and is overall a nice inclusion for the nominees this year.",

          "writeup": "“Seishun Complex” combines a suitably excellent rock track performed by the cast, with solid visuals to create an approachable opening that nearly everyone can appreciate.\n\nAt first glance, the opening appears reminiscent of many music-oriented shows, especially ones that focus on a small cast of female characters, but both the introduction and later half move in a more introspective direction. From direct cues - such as Hitori Gotou's awkward expressions and body language - to more subtle touches - such as showing her on stage alone while the other three appear together during the performance - the viewer is given a glimpse of the anxiety and isolation she experiences throughout the series.\n\nThe on-stage performance at the chorus is sharply directed, making full use of its color palette and animation to immerse the viewer in both the song and show while ensuring screen-time for the wider cast as well. Of particular note are the transitions to the shaded style during the first verse, or the close up of Hiroi Kikuri's face which both have really smooth motion and stand out with captivating colors.\n\nUnfortunately, though the opening is well constructed, there are times where the pace suffers. The initial character introductions are a main offender, and as a whole it could stand to differentiate itself more from the openings of other band-themed shows such as *K-On!* or *White Album 2*.",

          "writeup": "“The Rumbling” is a solid opening for fans of the *Attack on Titan* franchise that aims to match the despondent tone of the final season, with more intensity and urgency than its preceding opening, “My War”. The heavy-metal instrumentation by SiM is engaging and is a good fit to the tension and relevance of the Rumbling as it occurs in the show. Certain moments, such as Ymir rising up The Coordinate and flashes of Eren at different stages in life, are highlights for their synchronization with the music. Furthermore, details within the character-establishing shots of the titan shifters, especially Zeke's, are good reflections of the mental states of characters and plot beats throughout the show, despite the scenes being too short to discern any nuance in character personalities.\n\nUnfortunately, the visual composition of most sequences in the opening is largely inconsistent, with negative elements such as simple panning shots and characters that don't mesh well with backgrounds present. Screamer segments from SiM's vocalist Manabu Taniguti aren't auditorily pleasing, and often feel like they clash with the pacing and momentum of the song as well. All in all, while “The Rumbling” is inconsistent in a variety of aspects, the audiovisual highlights and interesting tie-ins to the plot help it stand out as a solid opening. ",

The balance of interpersonal moments, amongst the grand sense of scale the visuals bring forth strongly complements Vaundy's wonderfully invigorating instrumentation and evocative vocal performances. Yamashita's understanding of light comes forth tenfold here, offering appealing aesthetic approaches - such as rim-lighting and gorgeously composited effects - all the while featuring thematic significance layered within, reflecting the light and dark divide featured prominently within the show.\n\nThe opening as a whole is a visually soothing yet equally striking experience. It conveys impactful aspects of the narrative while creatively obscuring details, whilst transitioning from sequence to sequence through a cohesive and elegantly timed flow. No frame is put to waste, featuring intricate and captivating perspectives, with many instances finding new meaning as the show progressed. ”Hadaka no Yuusha” is a masterful achievement, perfectly encapsulating the experience of the parent series through both audio and visual strengths alike — it is an opening that has absolutely carved a spot among the very best.",

          "writeup": "“Chiki Chiki Ban Ban” takes a rather unique approach for an opening -  it centers everything around a fairly niche and nearly decade-old Eurobeat song from Hungary. A cover of Jolly's “Bulikirály” performed by QUEENDOM provides the core of the opening, tweaked slightly to fit the show's setting. The original Hungarian lyrics and accordion backing are replaced by Japanese lyrics and more traditional East Asian instrumentation. This decision imbues the opening with an infectious energy that fits the Japanese club scene that Kongming finds himself dropped into. It also links well with the genre of music that Eiko is attempting to forge a career in, giving the song choice a thematic tie-in that further improves its fit with the series.\nWhile the bright colors fit some of the crowded clubs shown, the opening is hit or miss in finding the right approach for applying the same effect to the wider scenes of the city. Additionally, the sequences portrayed can become a bit repetitive and lose some effectiveness later on in the opening with repeated viewings.\nDancing is the main focus of this opening, and it does so with highly detailed movements portrayed by the characters. Particular attention is given to the clothes the characters are dancing in, as the fabric bunches up, smooths out, and exhibits a wide array of other realistic tendencies that greatly add depth to the moves being performed.Overall, the opening does an excellent job of realistically capturing the appeal and energy of dancing.",

As is the case with their other nominations this year, Shingo Yamashita's direction satisfactorily delivers, and then some.  \n\n\nOne of the most recognizable aspects of this opening is its many movie references ranging from *The Big Lebowski* to *Attack of the Killer Tomatoes*. These shots are links to *Chainsaw Man*'s many western film homages and the author's Tatsuki Fujimoto's own love of movies, while also making connections between the characters and these movies. The visuals are packed with details, including symbolic references to character dynamics and motivations, and even a flashback sequence within the opening itself. All of this is delivered with fantastic animation and composition, though some usage of CG and fade transitions made a few scenes look clunky. The ambition and effort put in, however, are clear as day.  \n\n\nKenshi Yonezu's catchy song matches well with the humor and playful aggressiveness of the opening. It is matched effectively with the tone and tempo of the shots. The opening presents itself with confidence, which it certainly deserves as one of the best openings of the year.",

Although not every single one was equally noteworthy, a majority of them still received dedicated discussion and each had a strong possibility of being nominated. Since only up to two endings could be eligible, one from the jury and one from the public, this became its own form of ranking as well. Consequently, discussion often came down to how an ED compared against other *Chainsaw Man* EDs, rather than where it placed overall. This isn't to say it would have dominated the nominations were it allowed to, but it's definitely a testament to the quality of some of the endings that unfortunately had to be left behind.  The competition for this year was not taken for granted, and this is reflected in the final results. As each nominee excels in different aspects, there was a broad range of elements to consider when comparing them. From the immaculate visual style of \"Cobalt\"; to the heartfelt narrative of \"Tobira wo Akete Bell wo Narasou\"; and even the raw chaos that is \"Hawatari 2-Oku Centi\"; there was plenty to discuss. While it was clear early on that \"Hawatari\" was a strong frontrunner, the remaining candidates were evenly matched and it was difficult to tell which ones would come out ahead before the results were finalized.",

          "writeup": "“Tobira wo Akete Bell wo Narasou” seeks to detail the nature of the relationship between Kaede and Yuuka through the motif of hair. The ED telling a self-contained story of its own - a rarity for EDs this year - is a particular point of praise. This motif of hair is the anchor tying together the narrative, displaying the dynamics of Kaede and Yuuka's relationship with the former's brazen free spirit and the latter's pragmatic care for her friend. The ED finally reaches a harmonious conclusion where the compromise between the two is made and Kaede ties her hair in a way that is uniquely her own.\n\nThe entire ED is painted in Kou Yoshinari's idiosyncratic style. Foregoing traditional linework, his lineless style allows for some incredibly interesting animation techniques, such as the use of [dimpled edges](https://i.imgur.com/16iE43M.jpg) of the designs to convey movement rather than standard line smears. The character animation is excitingly nuanced throughout, with focus on little folds in fabric, movements such as Kaede [straightening herself](https://i.imgur.com/Jt9aTrg.jpg) after Yuuka's badgering or Yuuka's [teasing little jump](https://i.imgur.com/2RsDXGd.jpg) before she runs away at the end of the ED. These intricacies work as tone shifts for the flow of the girls' relationship - they are ultimately playful in the way they act, but still deeply care about one another. \n\nThough there were minor complaints about the repeated use of the same song for every ED, there is nothing but praise for the depiction of the ebb and flow of the girls' relationship.",

Accompanied by MOB CHOIR's inspiring performance, Miyo once again showcases their expertise in paint-on-glass animation techniques to bring forth a constantly evolving and visually stunning ending sequence which plays off of “Refrain Boy” from the beginning of the series.\n\nAptly titled, “Cobalt” is an absolutely gorgeous work, illustrating the vast potential that is available through alternative animation techniques within the medium. Thanks to assistant animation by Chiyoko Ueno, the final product is much more refined and clean in approach. This result is rather fitting, considering the focal shift from Reigen in the previous ending, to Mob here. The emphasis on deep blue colors is a nice shift in comparison to the harsher presentation in “Refrain Boy” and lovingly compliments the early morning city experience. The transition into Mob's morning jog, with his perspective filled with warmth and color, is an especially gorgeous sight to witness.\n\nThe extent of the thematic heights of the ending were a main limiting factor in its overall success compared to other nominees.

In *Chainsaw Man* fashion, this ED is a companion piece to the episode it aired with and serves as a stylistic retelling of the previous events. As a result, the ED's thematic focus of chaos, infinity and inescapability fit all too well.. \n\nThis theme is further represented by the art of MC Escher, whose work embodies similar concepts, as well as further portraying *Chainsaw Man*'s world and characters in the form of classical art. Similar to the OP, the horses featured here reference to *The Horse In Motion*, a series a photographs that led to the development of motion picture films, further weaving the creators' love of cinema into the DNA of *Chainsaw Man*'s iconography.\n \n“In The Backrooms” can be busy to a fault, however. It could be argued that it didn't really need to be quite so busy. The artistry displayed to evoke the sense of chaos is to be appreciated, but on the other hand, the ED as a whole feels overwhelming and disorganized.\n \nFor fans of media analysis, this ED is the gift that keeps on giving. It holds secrets that will be rewarding to return to on later viewings, especially for anime-only fans.

          "writeup": "“Let You Down” is a poignant and well-executed story of loss that works beautifully in concert with the parent series *Cyberpunk: Edgerunners*, but falls short of excellence in a competitive year for endings. The lighting is standout – featuring striking neon lighting set against the dreary grays of Night City – and doubles to impart nuanced character messaging. The framing evocatively characterizes Night City as the prison Lucy views it as. The illustrations are detailed and gorgeous and the animation is solid – particularly the slumping walk cycle – but it fails to match the pure spectacle of other entries.\nThis ending also lacked the ambition of other entries. Ultimately, the narrative is somewhat archetypal – a deeper dive into a character that demanded further treatment than the show offered. While it captures Lucy's character exceptionally and fills in some of the blanks – both emotive and narrative – it doesn't attempt anything more.\n\nThe wistful, plodding pacing can also be off-putting – particularly considering it opens with the two longest-running cuts. Taken holistically, it works fantastically – the slow burn of the visuals drag the viewer down into Lucy's introspective and pained mindset, and the haunting song offers chilling lyrics delivered in an unmistakably pained and resigned fashion, to gel flawlessly with the emotive visuals. It's an indisputable tour de force in conveying the despondent, melancholic emotive core of the series. If capturing the atmosphere of the parent series is an important function of an ending to you, then “Let You Down” will be a truly unforgettable experience!",

These lyrics allow for a surprising amount of introspection, as well as depictions of internal struggle that the show usually wouldn't treat the viewer to. The ED is oddly frank about how the characters both confront and run from their struggles. “Can't keep shrouding your heart in cosplay” was especially standout as both an amusing bar and a markedly in-character moment for Chika.\n\nAside from the lackadaisical implementation of credits, this ED impressed on every level thanks to rising star Vercreek's directorial debut. From his [hyper realistic](https://i.imgur.com/14fhPU2.jpg), [intense](https://i.imgur.com/GER4B0H.jpg) take on the show's character designs, to his [use of color](https://i.imgur.com/UcnTUEv.jpg) to portray the [back and forth](https://i.imgur.com/ft3kMr6.jpg) conflict between the boys and the girls, to his constant use of [light and shadows](https://i.imgur.com/yMpK4gh.jpg) to portray internal struggle, to his [snazzy transitions](https://i.imgur.com/BVntAu3.jpg) between [each side](https://i.imgur.com/V76g4PO.jpg) of the rap battle, the praise for the ED's visual technique is truly endless. In addition to this, the stiff, almost robotic, style of animation used for the breakdancing is perfectly juxtaposed by the smoother, more nuanced character animation in the latter half of the ED, feeding into the show's theming of “letting yourself be vulnerable” or “having your walls torn down.” \n\nDespite this ED only being shown for a single episode, it leaves a lasting impact on the viewer due to its creativity and incredibly thorough approach in craftsmanship.",

          "writeup": "Despite the title translating into ‘comedy', ”Kigeki” is surprisingly heartwarming. This ED is a relaxing and pleasant watch with a beautiful lo-fi vibe, lyrically exploring Anya's character and the coldness of the life she led before meeting Loid, in contrast to her current warm life. Responding to this, the colors get notably more warm, visually reflecting the lyrical progression.\n\n”Kigeki” also implements a lot of referential imagery to reflect the era in which the story takes place. This is especially clear with the usage of Mondrian paintings that were popular in the mid 20th century, along with the neon representations of era-specific interior design, such as Arne Jacobsen's “Swan Chair” or Eero Saarinen's “Tulip Chair” from the late 50's.\n\nUnfortunately, one of the biggest flaws of ”Kigeki” is the lack of interesting narrative cohesion, as the visuals touch on the story beats surrounding Anya at a surface level. As a result, it was hard to engage with the ED comparatively to the higher ranked entries.\n\nHowever, what ”Kigeki” lacks in regards to narrative appeal, it makes up for in spectacular background composites and the exceptional atmosphere that it creates, well fitting for the show. Alongside all the aforementioned strengths, the final product is befitting of the best of the year list.",

          "writeup": "More than pretty any much any other ED, “Hawatari 2-Oku Centi”  just gets its parent show *Chainsaw Man* - a chaotic and exhilarating work that revels in its own excess, yet somehow comes off as focused and endearing. Having unique endings every episode, *Chainsaw Man* is afforded surgical precision in capturing the essence and mood of an episode, and in no place is this clearer than here. While the music can be off-putting (which arguably works to further its goals), it undeniably fits the visuals - the song features a variety of progressions that keep it in perfect lockstep with both the wildly frenetic visuals during the glitchy, grindcore breakdown and the more relaxed portions accompanied by more upbeat J-rock. \n\nOf course, the music is only part of the winning equation – this ending also boasts some of the most impressive production of the year. Whether it's the striking color design that utilizes vibrant - almost neon - hues, gorgeous and evocative illustrations, or detailed and vivacious character animation, there's something impressive competing for your attention at all times. And yet, inspired storyboarding ensures these elements work in concert to create a uniquely visceral yet oddly comprehensible experience.\n\nAs if all that wasn't enough, there are some cool bits to dig into that provide insight into the characters, particularly Denji and his various relationships with the other characters. We see his view of Makima and the calming presence she exudes for him, the bizarre sense of normalcy he feels around his colleagues, and even to the influence Pochita still exerts.",

Composed mostly of stills, the ED tries to capture the viewer with its song, colors, and lighting, as well as the appeal of Nazuna's characteristic charm and design.  \n\n\nImages of Nazuna messing around coupled with nightlife colors and lights seems apt for *Call of the Night*. Unfortunately, the flashing lights can be irritating, and the approach relies too heavily on the usage of stills, lacking in animation compared to fellow nominees. The inclusion of the credits left some disappointed, with little work done on integrating them into the visuals. This simple visual concept, however, allows the song to stand out more. Creepy Nuts delivers a banger track, with its upbeat tone combining well with the mood of the visuals and Nazuna's revelry, especially with the latter half's more emphatic tone.\n\n\nA funky vibe and Nazuna's character design are what brought many to watch *Call of the Night*, so it's fitting that an ending matches that with its focus. Facing tough competition from the other nominees, this ED did not meet their level in quality, but earns a spot thanks to the memorable song this series was named after.",

There was also a great range of visual styles, from the painstakingly animated stop-motion of *Molcar*, to the beautifully drawn *Hisuian Snow*, as well as the charmingly hideous *Kendama Master Ken*. Just on the outside were the *Dongitsune Commercials*, also praised for their strong animation and soundtrack. All of that, along with diverse and creative anthologies like *Pokétoon* and *Animist*, meant that Short Series truly had something for everyone this year.  With such a relatively small pool of entries, the jury was able to choose the nominations with relative consensus, but ranking them was more challenging. In such a diverse category, it was difficult to find a one-size-fits-all set of criteria for judging the entries; the only thing that some of our entries have in common is that they’re both short and they’re both series. In the end, the creative breadth of our two anthology series helped to catapult them into the top two spots.

          "writeup": "By just about every reasonable metric, *Kendama Master Ken* is a terrible show. It looks eye-bleedingly bad. The compositing is abysmal. The CGI sticks out like a sore thumb. Half the time it feels like it was animated in MS Paint. The plot makes no sense. The characters do not behave like real people or even like caricatures. And yet, taken together, it's one of the funniest short series of 2022.\n\nBecause the dreadful production value and helter-skelter writing is the point, the show itself is the punchline. *Kendama Master Ken* artfully weaves together the worst of everything to craft a product that's intentionally bad but that knows exactly what it's doing and how to find the humor in it. It takes a lot of effort and heart to make a show look this bad, and that effort and heart are appreciated. The usage of mixed media, referential and meta humor, and over-the-top soundtrack creates something that transcends the bottom of the barrel to become a solid comedy.\n\nIt won't be for everyone. Some viewers may not be as amused by its self-aware, so-bad-it's-good shtick, and even those who do find humor in it may find that the show wears out its welcome as it drags on. And without that appeal, *Kendama Master Ken* is simply two hours of content that doesn't look very good. But for those it does click with, there is much mirth to be found.",

          "writeup": "*Hanabi-chan* excels in being a fun, slice-of-life short series through its comedic core concept of girls that can transform into pachinko machines. Its chibi-esque, expressive art style matches the chaotic and playful tone of the series well. Hanabi, Musashi, and the rest of the cast all have distinct personalities that help to foster the numerous “fish out of water” comedic situations in each episode. The inclusion of opening animations with a different artstyle each episode is a nice touch that further reflects the series's zany nature. Azumi Waki and Mao Ichimichi (as Hanabi and Thunder respectively) bring a lot of energy to their performances that was crucial in making a lot of the comedic moments land.\n\nUnfortunately, the latter half of the series doesn't give its side characters enough time to develop or have interesting comedic moments to warrant their introduction. Furthermore, although the last episode has a nice heartfelt ending, it still feels underwhelming due to its lack of connection to the core plot line that was loosely established in the rest of the series. \n\nDespite its flaws, *Hanabi-chan* takes advantage of the short series medium well through the strength of its bite-sized humor and enjoyable, zany character interactions.",

It's hard to talk about this series without mentioning its stellar stop motion work.  Many entries in this category had difficulty clearing the simple hurdle of holding together a complete run without any visual inconsistencies or obvious quality decay.  Every single episode of this series not only clears that hurdle with shocking ease, but also has incredibly creative choreography, as well as incredibly creative use of digital effects and sound design. The series' brilliant level of execution on all levels persists despite the incredibly long run of episodes.  \n\nWhile lacking any real narrative through its entire runtime, it doesn't really need one to accomplish its goals, and its absence is rarely felt while watching.  It's especially enjoyable to check out the behind-the-scenes footage that was frequently included to see how much time and effort went into making each individual episode come to life.  \n\nThis series is ultimately a no-brainer inclusion in this category especially considering the other entries, and hopefully will continue for some time into the future.",

The main plot of the girls trying to improve the public perception of oni is heartwarming and features good running gags and solid chemistry between its characters. The use of the onipan is surprisingly charming, given the portmanteau of “oni” (demon) and “pantsu”.\n\nWhere *Onipan* is divisive is in the voice acting. There's reason for praise considering the cast of voice actresses are under the age of 18; however, this also comes with them sounding rough around the edges. The production is decent, but some moments feel like corners were cut, such as choppy action sequences. On the other hand, the main cast is stylish, with each having their own flair, such as hairstyle and choice of clothing. They also each have strongly characterized personalities that pair with their looks. The soundtrack is surprisingly good for an original series. The music feels refreshing with praise to moments like the song for the fight sequence in episode two as well as the ending song. \n\nA fun journey with a likable cast, *Onipan* stands out for not being afraid to lean into its somewhat absurd premise. Its welcoming energy and use of comedic timing makes for a show that is perfect to sit down and watch with friends and family.",

The stop-motion animation is clean and impressive as ever and the molcars are still adorable with their felt backs and goofy sound effects. The show's aesthetic is remarkable, and that stays true for season two. The soundtrack is also a standout aspect with fantastic mixing and an appropriate scale to voicing, musicality, and sound design.\n\n*Driving School*'s biggest detriment is that it doesn't add a lot to the series. It keeps the same tried and true formula of quick gags with exceptional stop motion, but this can get repetitive as the series fails to innovate itself. It's still as short and sweet as the first season, but may not have captured that same lightning in a bottle.\n\nWith that being said, it looks amazing, it's quite funny, and the cute felt molcars have brought back that same joy and passion into the second season with the same lighthearted, goofy comedy and fantastic visual flair.

Each episode of this anthology had its own director and style, allowing each of them to do something different visually and narratively. \nThe variety in stories presented is stellar. One short presents a nostalgic return to the western retro cartoon style featured in “Scraggy and Mimikyu”.  The next episode tells the story of a Panchamp attempting to defy its evolutionary path in “The Pancham Who Wants to Be a Hero”. “The Slugma-Powered Home” and “Blossom's Dream” were examples of the more traditional wholesome theme of friendship common in the Pokemon franchise while still telling their own unique story. Many episodes stood out with their strong narratives, especially “Help! I've Turned Into A Gengar.”\n\nThe visual diversity is fantastic as well. Going from rubber-hose animation in the Mimikyu short to the picture book style from Pancham makes for a unique experience in each episode.   \n\nDespite the varying directions of each short, the sound design and OST is consistently strong, especially a standout piece in  “Wait for me, Magikarp” which featured an enjoyable flute tune for its duration that integrated well into the animation of its story.  \n\n*Poketoon* successfully manages to offer an anthology that truly has something for everyone, even those who aren't familiar with the Pokemon series, making it arguably the most lovable short series of the year.",

Unfortunately, this production largely feels like a playthrough of the visual novel released alongside the YouTube series just with added voice acting. Additionally, most of the cast rarely get the opportunity to develop the characters they portray.  \n*HololiveERROR* frames itself as a horror story; but its approach to scaring its audience relies heavily on static glitching effects that largely fall flat. The story jumps from point to point too often and continually introduces new characters, with many of them having next to no lines or impact on the story.  This was definitely meant to ensure they included as many VTubers as they could, ensuring fans wouldn't feel like their favorite was missing. However, for outsiders new to the franchise, very few of them get enough characterization to latch onto. The voice acting and music is serviceable, but even the best of performances can't compensate for its lack of animation.  \n*HololiveERROR* does very little to capture the imaginations of viewers unfamiliar with its involved characters due to its unengaging story and almost non-existent animation.

A type of deeply-embedded distrust between people and Pokemon in certain locales is one of those aspects, but *Hisuain Snow* provides viewers who already love Pokemon an in-depth look at why that distrust developed the way it did, and what the obstacles to overcoming it are. In the process, it brings daily existence in Hisui to life, inviting the viewer to easily imagine themselves in the situations being portrayed.\n\nThe backgrounds in the series are the most noticeable tool at its disposal. Both detailed and stylized, they emphasize the environment that has shaped human-Pokemon relations in Hisui. Furthermore, a noticeably different artstyle is applied to scenes showing the folklore, allowing viewers to readily differentiate between myths embedded in the local culture and events actually occurring in the current time.\n\nThe series is short but sweet, although that brevity can make the story feel less than fully explored. Not every aspect is fleshed out to the degree necessary for maximum emotional resonance, so the series length of three episodes may not be ideal. Despite that, *Pokemon: Hisuain Snow* still manages to bring a new perspective to the franchise, allowing us to fall further in love with the property.  ",

          "writeup": "The *Ganbare Douki-Chan Special* is largely a straight continuation of the first season. The fanservice in the context of an onsen while the three female characters talking is interesting enough, but there is not much at all besides this. The majority of the runtime of the special is an extended scene involving the three primary girls taking a bath together in the hot tub, with practically nothing of substance beyond the well animed visual fanservice. The most engaging part of the special is the reappearance of the eyeless doppelganger. The short goes out of its way to show the doppelganger clearly blushing, which seems to imply some degree of actual agency, but unfortunately his lack of eyes remains off-putting.\nThe special lacks whatever modicum of variety and nuance the first season had, and unfortunately it is hardly a satisfying fanservice-style escalation of the main series, either. In the parent series, the lack of depth to the characters, except for Douki-chan, is disappointing, and the special does little to add to her character nor characterize the other girls. Overall the animation was very smooth, but the focus of said animation leaves much to be desired.\nUnfortunately the special avoids having anything particularly impressive within its short run time besides making scantily clad and very attractively-proportioned anime girls feel dull and boring.",

The only thing close to a blemish this series has visually are the CG openings, which were divisive in quality and also jarring compared to the traditionally-animated episodes they follow. The stories themselves are light and fun and definitely enjoyable to watch for fans of the series; each character gets their own vignette, which helps strengthen some of the lesser-seen characters in the cast like Elma.\n\nUnfortunately, even if the production levels and stories were of higher quality than other entries on this list, the fact that it's a companion piece makes it unsuitable to be ranked higher, as *Mini Dra* is near impossible to appreciate without a prior knowledge and love for its parent series. Still, it's not easy passing up more content from a beloved series, especially with the coveted quality of a Kyoto Animation production.",

Encompassing all things ranging from professional advertisements, to music videos, and even student films, each short had a different meaning and context behind it. This made the task of narrowing the selection down to just a few exceedingly difficult.   As eligible shorts continued to be added throughout the process, the jury was constantly challenged to analyze all aspects of each short to decide which ones conveyed their apparent message the best. Shorts as brief as one minute, such as the visual spectacle of *Yama Day*, and as long as 40, like the character-driven film *Summer Ghost*, were some notable entries that generated a good amount of discussion, but just barely missed the cut. The numerous music videos of Eve (*Mob*, *Fight Song*, and *White Snow*, to name a few) also garnered a lot of attention from the jury but were unable to make it in.  As the competition for placings was intense, the jury was divided. Almost all of the top ten shorts that were nominated had a decent amount of support behind them, with discussions highlighting different areas that each short excelled in. Ultimately, the smooth visuals and strong audiovisual synchronization of *Darkroom* caused it to barely edge out above the competition, narrowly beating *The Streetlight and the Cat* and *Kurei*.",

Instead, “Kurei” gets the spotlight for being a stylistic departure from their previous works, utilizing echocardiograms and 3D objects among other things to make a truly weird video. This is in addition to Waboku's trademark of incredible visual synchronicity, making lightning-fast cuts or displaying fantastic character animation in busy parts of the song, while slower sections still hold up thanks to picture-perfect framing. Each second of “Kurei” could be a compelling screenshot.\n\nWhile lacking a typical narrative structure, the emotional core of the video manages to be accessible and coalesces with the song's lyrics and tone. “Kurei” is about anger and it's depicted in shades of orange that cut through an otherwise dark video full of muted grays and blacks. This clever use of color design sidesteps clichés of similar works, as red is usually the color of danger and anger. This video would have remained one of the year's best even if the music wasn't as good as it is, but Lanndo composed a fun song that still fits into its own darkness thanks to Nanataki Ima's passionate vocals.\n\nThese individual elements all come together to create a work that is incredibly rewatchable and stands head and shoulders above pretty much every other short that came out this year.",

Dios meets those expectations head-on with the video for “Darkroom,” the first track on their debut album CASTLE. \n\n\nWhile musical prowess was to be expected, it's the mesmerizing visuals that steal the show. Fluid and ever-changing, the animation has few cuts or breaks and causes the video to essentially function as one continuous experience that echoes the emotional ebb and flow of the song. A black-and-white color scheme helps distorted shapes to still be discernible and readable while further emphasizing the emotional disconnect featured in the song. This scheme lays those emotions bare, mirroring the vocals in giving itself no bright facade to hide behind.\n\nThe vocals themselves show an enormous amount of both experience and willingness to step outside comfort zones. While much of the delivery is clearly professional, there are also moments where that polish is stripped away, with breaths inserted in unconventional places to transform consonants into new sounds and convey the rawness of the subject material. The song's story of growth is directly communicated through the lyrics, as the singer conveys the thoughts of someone realizing the necessity of exposing themselves to the outside in order to experience the \"light\" found in life, instead of shutting oneself inside a dark room.  These lyrics are what tie together a beautiful and incredible short film.",

As its title suggests, it's a heartwarming, adorable tale of a stray cat and its emotional-support streetlight. And, in a brief five minutes, it crafts a more compelling story than many shows do in a full cour. This is no mere tearjerker, nor does it revel in the saccharine to its detriment. It is a quiet celebration of day-to-day mundanity. The hero's many faces are on full display, from wild beast to tamed companion, from fierce hunter to literal scaredy cat. Such is the dynamism of life.\n\nAnimated with such heart and care, there is much to praise about *Streetlight*'s production. The charming style, strong directing, and simple but effective character animation for its feline protagonist make it a joy to watch. Sound design is also a standout, with the buzz and whimper of the titular lantern and the soft pitter-patter of paws on pavement helping to bring the world to life.\n\nSimple yet captivating, *Streetlight* is a treat for the eyes, ears, and soul. It is with such simple beauty that *The Streetlight and the Cat* finds itself near the pinnacle of this year's anime shorts.",

The watercolor aesthetic and soft linework are engaging when combined with the animation, which becomes increasingly fluid over time. There is a nice sense of pace and contrast between environments in *Diving*, with the sequence of the child struggling to breath while surrounded by darkness immediately followed by a scene of slower abstract visuals before the crescendo that is the vibrant dash to touch the seafloor in time.\n\nThe instrumentation has a nice level of depth, with the light synth at the start exuding the ambience of the sea well. Audiovisual synchronization is great as the synth gets brighter and drums get added during the final dash sequence before the sound design revolves back to the serenity of the start of the short. The transition at the end is spectacular for reframing the entire context of the short from a simple, abstract story about perseverance in the face of struggle to that of someone clinging on to their dreams and making the most of them before they wake up back to reality.\n\nWhile the audiovisual highs of this short weren't as consistent or strong as some of the other shorts this year, *Diving* is nonetheless a spectacular short for how it uses its visual presentation and sound design to convey its themes.",

You don't have to know the characters or be a fan of *ONE PIECE* to understand this short. The themes are clear and consistent. The narrative is easy to follow but not mundane, following two girls who are seemingly inseparable but with the implication that tragedy is around the bend. hinted at by  use of color throughout, with shifts between beautiful, rich fields of flowers and wilted dying ones in a dark, dim room. \n\nThe music and visuals fit together well enough but don't quite click as well as some other shorts. The pacing can feel like it's dragging on the narrative, as longer scenes lose the story.. The style is very simple but pairs well.\n\nOne aspect that is obviously the standout is the song, performed by Ado with an impressive amount of range. She has moments of powerful vocals and soft notions that melodically fit with the windy, somber, and bright moments of the animation. The visuals are crisp with line work that's smooth and animation that was produced with passion.. \n\n*Where the Wind Blows* stands on its own as a story outside of the *ONE PIECE* universe. In its short runtime, these characters are shown in never-before-seen ways.. It's a solid entry for shorts this year with a rich visual display and great choice in its music. \n",

The unique visuals and transitions, glitchy animation and a striking, moody color palette gives the film an ethereal quality that captures layers of grief and rage felt by the girl. The transitions between scenes, particularly the use of the skateboard as a screen to display backstory, are impressive. The entire short is animated so that it looks like one continuous shot which, combined with the slow, echoing vibe of the instrumentation, gives the music video a unique audiovisual identity.\nThe video employs a bold black and blue-green color scheme that creates a powerful visual impact that aligns with the underlying theme. The story delves into the poignant and intimate account of a girl's sorrow over the death of her father, which is reflected in the use of black and various shades of green and blue. The presence of red in the girl's memories on the black, green, and blue color palette emphasizes the twisted pain she now associates with these memories of her dead father.\nOverall the music was more mixed than the visuals. The echoey instrumentation and synthetic sounds fit the overall space motif well, but the vocals don't quite land as strongly. Although the music is more mixed than the visuals, Floating Girl is a beautifully crafted short film that successfully captures the depth and complexity of grief through its unique visuals and strong central themes.",

The biggest strength of the video is the way that it combines strong and varied visual elements with a solid vocal performance, all of which tie very heavily into the titular character of Marine thematically. The video has a great use of different art styles ranging from more traditional anime art styles to one that is more abstract and red, to another that is black and white with an emphasis on shading. Marine's vocals are also a big standout. Her sultry voice fits the tone of the video, but more than this there's also cutesiness, teasing, boasting, challenging, and provoking, serving to highlight the multiple facets of her appeal.\nUnfortunately, about half of the video basically consists of still frames that, while thematically relevant, are visually uninteresting. They are all unequivocally horny, but spending nearly the entire first minute and a half on them leaves the viewer unsatisfied and begging for more, even though the vocals remain highly stimulating during the entire experience. It ultimately leaves the entire production feeling split in half between a mix of genuinely great visuals across multiple styles of animation and a particularly provocative powerpoint presentation. And although the less engaging parts of the video are still accompanied by Marines' great vocals, this lengthy blemish holds it back compared to the best in the category. ",

The music video does a good job of alternating between highlighting the big climactic fights of the series with the narrative arcs of the main characters, both of which were central to what made *Naruto* so successful. *Naruto* did a great job at bringing in a whole generation of teens into watching anime, and this capitalizes at bringing all that nostalgia to the forefront by showcasing classic scenes and music to a more modern audience. A lot of the soundtracks from this time were extremely memorable, which brings back a lot of hype and sentimentality for the series as a whole.\n\nHowever, the biggest problem is that it doesn't really add anything substantial to the subject and is, in a sense, a glorified AMV stretched out to ten minutes, which may have been a bit too long. It could have also been visually upgraded, but the production values are about the same as when it aired.\n\nRemastering highlights is a good way to bring back a fanbase into a nostalgia kick, and *Road of Naruto* does a great job with its solid editing work and musical choices. It's a pleasant trip down memory lane and showcases some of the best moments while tagging on some of the series' greatest musical hits, but it falls short of other short films this year that were more substantially transformative or thematically meaningful.",

It can feel like the slow burn is taking its time with the story a bit too much. Some of the sequences feel a bit off because there are elements that feel unrealistic. The short can feel over-the-top at times with repeating narratives that can feel like it's explaining some plot points that could otherwise have more nuance.\n\n*Let You Down* pairs almost perfectly with its visuals and audio. There are moments of cinematic timing where the two line up perfectly, such as  the bubble gum in the elevator. The production, animation, and detailed backgrounds rival what you'd find in music videos with larger budgets, with shots that could easily be used as desktop wallpapers.. The song tells the story as much as the visuals do, with its melancholy and airy energy.\n\nMuch like the *Cyberpunk: Edgerunners* series, *Let You Down* is special in how ambitious it is.

A highly abstract work, *Ikuta* features vignettes that explore myriad nightmarish scenes united by threads of anxiety and absurdity. The otherworldly scenarios provide a black mirror for the audience to imprint their own interpretations and anxieties, creating a completely personal experience. This is a double-edged sword, however – while providing ripe ground for analysis, it is unrelentingly demanding of the viewer. Though the runtime is about an hour, it can feel excessive with how taxing it is to engage with, made more challenging by the disturbing visuals and production itself.\n\nPerhaps the most unique feature is the sound. Scored by Willem Breuker – or rather, his album is adapted by the film – the varied, discordant soundtrack is connected only by its haunting and ethereal nature. Sound design brilliantly helps to realize the absurd world. Most strikingly, there is no dialogue, with interludes of text substituting, in this case equally poignant and cryptic.\n\nThe visuals are also utterly extraordinary. The animation appears sparse, but delicate details abound to showcase its effort and artistry, giving tremendous character to the presentation.  The illustrations themselves are macabrely evocative, and the boarding is intentional and effective, offering framing which emphasizes the loneliness and darkness of the work and motifs that literally evolve throughout the film to match their evolving meaning. *Ikuta no Kita* is truly a one-of-a-kind work that rises to the top on the back of well-executed novelty.",

In particular *ARIA The BENEDIZIONE* focuses on the often underrepresented bond between Aika and Akira giving a lot of closure to their relationship with a heavy emphasis on how hard both work.  \n\nThe movie shows a great depiction of a relationship between an apprentice and teacher and the feelings both have for eachother. A large part of the film focuses on how they both inspire and motivate each other through their friendly rivalry. It accomplishes this through flashbacks to pivotal moments of each character's development not directly covered in the parent series to great effect. Though this reliance on flashbacks also keeps the film somewhat stuck in the past, retreading on older content, which makes the movie feel less like its own unique product.\n\nVisually the film is a mixed bag with the new character designs being adequate in showing that the characters have matured and grown, but also losing some of the charm of the original designs due to the sharper linework. But the background art works better, in particular during the nighttime scenes where it highlights the beauty of Neo Venezia. \n\nIn spite of some of its issues the film still works as a really strong epilogue for the franchise, showing off the adored cast one last time and earning it a spot with the best films of the year.",

Between dynamic camera work and fantastic sound editing, *GuP Saishuushou 3* manages to be both unfathomably cool and absolutely hilarious. It goes overboard with its tank fights concept and sacrifices all logic for the sake of making the fights themselves absurd and entertaining. *GuP Saishuushou 3* consistently remains an enjoyable ride without brakes and packs as many entertaining things as it can into its extremely short runtime.\n\nHowever, being the third installment in a series of six movies, the structure of the events comes off as rather jarring, with the movie starting off halfway through the battle from the previous entry and ending only a couple minutes into the very next one. The jungle setting of the first half of the movie gets rather tedious to look at after a while, even if it functions well as the background for different set pieces throughout the battle which utilize its environment in creative ways.\n\nWhile its structure precludes it from telling a conclusive story, it doesn't take away from the sheer entertainment value of *Girls und Panzer: Saishuushou 3*'s adrenaline pumping tank battles.",

          "writeup": "A fun adventure that explores the suppressed tales of the Heike. *Inu-Ou* dives into a mesh of historical fiction told through a rock opera, with themes of identity and self-actualization woven throughout.\n\nThe film boasts a charming presentation, with Nobutake Itou's malleable designs lending to its naturalistic animation. Tomona sees the world through pastel-colored painterly silhouettes while Inu-Oh's view is morphed by his misshapen body. A particularly charming scene is seeing Tomona's world brighten up with more saturated colors after first meeting Inu-Oh, emphasizing the importance of their relationship.\n\nAnother standout is how it communicates the dysphoria both characters experience through physical changes in its designs. Inu-Oh's body restructures on successive performances to become a more conventional performer, while Tomona changes appearance from monk and biwa player to a more androgynous rock musician. The changes throughout the film exhibit that theme of self-actualization and comfortability in bodily expression.\n\nThe music and a lot of the voice acting owes its allure to Avu-Chan's impressive vocal range and Yoshihide Ootomo's marriage of folk music and traditional instrumentation. While the background tracks in the film stick to more traditional form for the era, as the film goes on it adds modern instruments to better characterize the modernization of the artform. The vocal songs also carry this sense of modernization: using call and response dynamics between the focused rhythmic section and Avu-Chan's powerful vibrato.\n\nAltogether, *Inu-Ou* is a euphoric experience that elevates its subject matter into an unforgettable performance.",

The same team returned to *Totsukuni* and developed it into a movie that managed to expand upon its short story counterpart for better and for worse.\n\n*Totsukuni no Shoujo* the movie is as stunning visually as its short film predecessor. Kubo and Maiya both lend their styles to Shiva and Sensei's dream sequences, giving each their own unique feeling. The way Shiva blends into the painterly textures of her dreams echoes her feelings of ambivalence yet contrasts with the paint-on-glass technique used to signify Sensei's own anxieties. Though the movie does not go towards as much of a storybook appearance as its short film did, it still manages to portray the idyllic landscapes of mangaka Nagabe's world effortlessly.\n\nThe short film for *Totsukuni* did not rely upon dialogue to tell its story as opposed to the movie which inserted voices for all the characters. Rie Takahashi perfectly embodies the contrast between Shiva's daughterly naivete and her inner fears and Jun Fukuyama's voice for Sensei pairs well with hers. At times though, the movie overstates the character's emotions in a straightforward manner that feels ill fitting for an otherwise indie-lite production.\n\nNonetheless, the journey Shiva and Sensei take together as they develop their father-daughter like relationship is heartwarmingly bittersweet. Yutaro Kubo and Satomi Maiya's partnership under Wit's Ibaraki studio is definitely something to look forward to for future projects as well.",

On a surface level, the film poses that crucial question, as all sequels must, of “What happens next?” But the themes run so much deeper than that, exploring what it means to be a creator and performer as well as the viewer's relationship with the medium itself. *Revue Starlight* looks the audience in the eye and asks them just what it is they want to see on stage, and then it delivers in spades.\n\nThe *Revue Starlight Movie* is a feast for the eyes and ears alike. Throughout the film there's a meticulous attention to detail, fleshing out both the characters and themes. Excellent boarding, outstanding costume and set design, stellar choreography, and a phenomenal soundtrack make each revue a joy to watch. The use of light and color in the Revue of Competition, the emotional catharsis of the Revue of Hunting, and the rich symbolism in the Revue of Souls in particular stand out. Every instrument contributes to the symphony; every stage girl has a role to play. The film has no weak link.

The ending feels cathartic, but at the same time structurally safe. At a whopping two hours and 16 minutes, the movie both feels too long and also not long enough to justify Fuutarou's pick.\n\nA significant portion of the movie is focused on the events that occur during a school festival, which is divided into five arcs - one for each quintuplet. Some of these arcs drag on and feel unnecessary, with one of them adding in last-minute family drama. The epilogue of the movie is similarly long and drawn out, with Fuutarou again going through his connection with each of the quintuplets one by one. The structure is too safe, seeking to please fans of every sister instead of emphasizing on the girl Fuutarou finally picks.\n\nVisually, this movie is on par with season two of the series. When it does close-ups, the AD work manages to elegantly beautify the quintuplets' faces. Some scenes also have decent, dramatic lighting and compositing, like the classroom scene transitions for each of the quintuplets. In terms of animation, there is a fun idol dance bit, but otherwise the movie more heavily relies on keeping the girls looking consistently pretty and having a few nicely adapted boards.\n\nFor fans of *Go-toubun no Hanayome* though, this movie gives closure, something that is rare in today's anime landscape and worth celebrating.",

This shift in focus gives Asuna some very welcome characterization that is absent in the original, and her relationship with Misumi is also a worthwhile addition. Furthermore, composer Yuki Kajiura returns with her signature music that effectively sets the mood for each scene, creating the foundation for an enjoyable experience. \n\nUnfortunately, the film is held back by its latter half, which introduces narrative developments that undermine the improvements brought by the first half. Kirito's introduction lacks any notable additions that make him more compelling, and his relationship with Asuna is poorly developed within the film, hurting Asuna's own character arc. The film also struggles to impress in its visual production outside of the climax, and elements like the new character designs fail to match the appeal of the original's. \n\n*Hoshinaki Yoru no Aria*'s overall weaknesses in comparison to the other nominees weighs it down; nevertheless, it certainly has its worthy place within the *Sword Art Online* franchise.",

The new circumstances allow for a much needed revitalization of the formula - the characters face various problems figuring out the ways of navigating adult life, such as finding time to meet each other and reminisce about their more easygoing days.\n\nThe movie retains the distinct laid-back atmosphere of the original series with its soft humor and amiable character interactions. However, it doesn't really develop the topic of being \"older\", as the girls barely have any setbacks at their jobs and easily seek out opportunities to hang out again, which largely defeats the purpose of the time skip. Another unfortunate pitfall is the visual aspect - the background art is largely painted with muted colors with lots of gray mixed in, and the overall environments don't bring out the excitement of discovering a beautiful place to camp at, since the cast spends the vast majority of the movie in a single place. Outside of facial expressions, the movie doesn't boast expressive animation, and could use more creative storyboarding to highlight the dynamic of the characters. \n\nThat being said, *Yuru Camp△ Movie* holds tight to the successful formula of the original series, and is a generous serving to any fan of the franchise.",

Several mainstays in the show reprise their roles (such as Gojo and Maki) while also giving us some insight into Surugu Getou as an antagonist and foil to Yuuta. But the heart of the story really revolves around his desire to be free of Rika's curse.\n\nThere's a fun combination of action choreography and a popping soundtrack that matches the action on screen, such as Gojo's fight or Yuuta's fight with Getou; there's some confidence in how it creates excitement and delivers on the spectacle.\n\nThe film has issues though, such as some pretty garish art direction, compositing, and an overall confusing aspect ratio. The move to cinemascope is a bold choice to introduce more space on screen for character blocking and introducing bokeh effects, but the film rarely utilizes this aspect ratio (2.35:1) in its storyboards, instead stretching some shots out or making others feel unnecessarily claustrophobic. The landscapes selected for the background art are interesting, though the earthy color tones give them a bleakly muddy feel. The plot itself feels a bit too bare bones in its execution, not really taking the time to expand on the cast much beyond the Yuuta vs Getou rivalry.\n\nIssues aside, the film works well with its fun action set pieces and a focused character study on Yuuta, and it earns its place among the nominees.

While it is always a tough job to narrow down a list of excellent anime into just five jury nominees, and a lot of excellent titles did miss out, the most regrettable one being the final season of *Mob Psycho 100*, which fell just shy of making it in by coming sixth in both the public and jury rankings. The elephant in the room is the number of slice-of-life nominees. While it may seem like the jury’s intent was nominating as many shows of the genre as possible, there were actually deep divisions. All three of them had ardent fans, due to *Yama no Susume*’s culmination of a fantastic character arc, *Do It Yourself*’s idiosyncratic mix of CGDCT and technoskepticism, and *Akebi*’s uniquely nostalgic romanticism. These distinct flavors also meant each show had their detractors as they appeal to completely different sets of fans. *Lycoris Recoil* and *Ousama Ranking* don’t fit this neat genre mold either, being an action thriller and an adventure fantasy respectively. Shows were analyzed from every aspect: their audiovisual production, their narrative quality, their thematic value, and the synergistic sum of each show. While there were somewhat distinct tiers of preference during final rankings, there was still a wide variety in jury opinions about each nominee, despite extensive discussion. This fact only speaks to their quality and the powerful effect they can conjure if only they were watched with an open mind.",

Fuji again. Before that, she undergoes physical training which is depicted captivatingly with weighty animation, as well as emotional growth as seen in moments like her identifying her past struggles in Kasumi and giving her helpful advice. Aoi mitigating her social anxiety to open up to her class, even without Hinata's help, is another highlight.\n\nIt should be noted that the season has a somewhat awkward structure as it consists of four mini-episodes attached before recaps, ten half-length episodes, and three full-length episodes. However, most of the episodes themselves are stunning, with many highlights arising by giving free-reign to animators to put their stamp on the show's aesthetic. These aren't limited to just episodes about Aoi either, as there are stellar episodes focused on other characters, like the insane introduction of Hinata's overworked mom in 9b, or the mature treatment of Hikari's melancholic attempts to rebound in 6a. Additionally, there are the stunning endings by Kou Yoshinari which further strengthen the relationships of the characters.\n\nThe pitch-perfect finale delivers on the season-long build-up by capturing Aoi's struggles and victories in the Mt. Fuji climb equally well, cementing the franchise's theme of life being a series of peaks and valleys best traversed step-by-step. The synergistic confluence of all its audiovisual and narrative elements land the show atop our summit.",

On top of that, its character designs are extremely striking in their distinct shape design and flat coloring that uses two-tone shading to synchronize with its environments. *DIY* also exhibits some delicately crafted character animation that shows off each character's naturalistic movements and individualistic craftsmanship in creating projects. And to top it off, the soundtrack is captivating in harmonizing with the show's bubbly atmosphere that helps make certain moments feel more organic in delivery.\n\nThe cast dynamics and interactions range in reception. Yua and Purin act as foils in that Yua's desire to explore diy involves more injuries, much to Purin's chagrin, but their bonding allows Purin to become more open and honest while Yua becomes more observant. Meanwhile Shii and Rei are underutilized within the cast and their motivations feel more obfuscated. Shii, in particular, feels largely unexplored aside from her introductory addition to the club, and it affects her background interactions with characters such as Rei or Purin.\n\nWhile not every individual character is a slam dunk, *DIY* exhibits a loving relationship for a craftsman ethos with a desire for communal bonding, making its earnest sincerity a worthy entry to watch this year.",

Shingo Adachi's directorial debut is a masterclass in how to board a fight, no matter how insane the narrative might get. This insanity is a result of the show's consistent tension rising throughout the second half, which offers a lot of interesting food for thought thematically, as well as gives us entertaining interactions between Chisato and the show's main villain. Yet the show fails to make a clear stance on its own universe in a way that'd tie up all its different plot threads together. \n\n*Lycoreco* sometimes feels like it's not that interested in exploring its own story in a meaningful way, but its goals are located somewhere else. It's a show first and foremost about simply having exciting fun with its cast of colorful characters, while utilizing every buddy cop trope it can think of: rebelling against your boss, having epic shootouts and, most importantly, homoerotic undertones!",

          "writeup": "The fiercely-anticipated anime adaptation of *SPY x FAMILY* burst onto the scene in 2022. For the first time viewers got to see the antics of the makeshift Forger family, and they didn't disappoint. Three rather unique individuals with widely different backgrounds come together for their own individual reasons, and the resulting product is both entertaining and heartwarming.\n\nThe shining star of the series is young Anya. A strong performance by Atsumi Tanezaki brings the precocious telepathic child to life, along with particularly expressive facial animation. Anya's influence is strongly felt in nearly every scene she's featured in, while still making it clear that she's an inexperienced little kid who doesn't know how to properly evaluate the vast amount of information her ability gives her access to.\n\nOne issue with Anya's dominant presence so far is that it leaves some of the other primary characters less fleshed-out. Yor in particular gets sidelined for significant stretches, especially in Part 2. Additionally, Loid's primary mission (the entire reason for the Forger family coming together) receives less attention in Part 2 than would be expected for such a major plot point. The side characters were also something of a mixed bag, as the good-natured Franky adds to the series' lovable shenanigans while the siscon Yuri and Loid-obsessed Fiona are implemented much less smoothly.\n\nOverall though, *SPY x FAMILY*'s first two cours provide a compelling foundation for the series to continue to build on, with many future hijinks with the Forgers sure to come.",

          "writeup": "*Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Ultra Romantic* manages to stay fresh and exciting throughout its ultra romantic third season. Relationships are pushed to the forefront as both the main cast and its supportive characters explore a wide range of love: from the mutual love of our tsundere leads Shirogane & Kaguya, to the potential love of Ishigami & Tsubame, to the bittersweet first love of Hayasaka, and Chika's lack of interest in her own love but finding a newfound interest in BL as a love detective.\n\nThe animation is a slight step down from previous seasons and there is a clear reliance on reusing manga assets, often with lackluster implementation. However, thanks to Hatakeyama's unique sense of direction that understands the work on a fundamental level, it makes most romcoms pale in comparison to *Kaguya*'s immensely creative & energetic presentation. Similar to previous years, it sports one of the strongest voice actor lineups of the year, with brilliant delivery for both their comedic shenanigans and introspective moments.\n\nThe sketches of the middle portion are a bit inconsistent, though Hayasaka's arc and Maki's introduction are positive standouts. Nevertheless, the school festival arc is a bold breath of fresh air that provides moments of introspection that challenges the core mechanic of the work.\nDespite a slight drop in visual presentation and inconsistent middle section, it's still an immensely satisfying season of this modern romcom classic.",

          "writeup": "*Cyberpunk: Edgerunners* is an unusually true-to-genre cyberpunk tragedy, complete with the genre trappings of corporate dystopia and transhumanism in the form of cybernetics along with the accompanying fatalistic pessimism. Though the story is somewhat archetypal, blending common cyberpunk and mob thriller tropes, the personal story of David Martinez is resonant, and the vibrant cast is both purposeful to support the thematics and just plain fun. The rise and fall of David is compelling to witness. Even if the fall is predictable, it's very in line thematically and still remains engaging due to investment in the characters. The anime touches on themes of extraordinary ability and dreams, contrasting these against the aforementioned genre trappings to create a rich and engaging work.\n\nThe production consistently supports the narrative vision and elevates the material. While not boasting quite the animation associated with Imaishi, the animation is certainly above average, featuring slick action and deft character animation sprinkled throughout. The boarding features superbly stylized and meaningful rimlighting and some very solid action boarding. Transitions often accomplish more than linking scenes, effectively creating meaning between them depending on the demands of the scene. Vibrant backgrounds that feel lived in provide visual appeal in addition to supporting the theming by emphasizing the class divide from the corporates and has-nots.\n\nOf course, the crown jewel is episode 6, which features a truly gripping midseason climax and some of the most engaging and unique visuals of the year.",

          "writeup": "Between its hack-and-slash filled action scenes and gripping character exposition, at a glance *Chainsaw Man* fulfills the expectations of many for a shounen adaptation with gore and grit at its core. Beyond a glance, however, themes which feel integral to a successful execution of the work are not given sufficient exploration through the runtime. The show touches on the role and influence of the fears devils represent in society; true horror depictions from character and monster designs; and the significance of humanity in a world of monsters; but sidelines these integral worldbuilding ideas in favor of character building. Fortunately, the efforts put into character building allow for poignant interpersonal moments within the cast, providing an alternative foundation for this season. \n\nDenji is a vital link to the cast at large, and the show makes every effort to give him a spotlight role in exploring the cast. From his single-brain-cell comedic partnership with Power, to brotherly rivalry with Aki, and lascivious lust towards Himeno and Makima, the power dynamics and interpersonal dependence structures within Division Four are suitably fleshed out in preparation for the show's narrative twists. Specific highlights of these relationships include the manipulative portrayal of Makima's secretive persona - assisted greatly by the show's intimate framing and Tomori Kusonoki's seiyuu performance, and Himeno's moments of vulnerability allowing for deeper insight into the stresses of working in Public Safety.\n\n*Chainsaw Man* is a work full of potential, and the building blocks for a continuation of the show have been brought into perspective, but future seasons will need to reassess the best way to piece them together.",

          "writeup": "There is a thin line between laughing with someone and laughing at someone, but Keiichirou Sato's *Bocchi the Rock!*, perhaps the biggest surprise of the entire 2022, is nothing short of a masterclass in balancing on this line. *Bocchi* is a deeply sympathetic and unbelievably funny exploration of social anxiety, pouring with creativity and passion at every step in our protagonist's journey. It's a series that effortlessly turns relatable and grounded fears of a lonely person into ingenious visual gags, without sacrificing the realism of its world. Whether our titular character turns into a low resolution CG polygon model, pops like a balloon or courageously becomes the center of attention during a concert, the flair and endless imagination is always here, always elevating itself to higher and higher grounds.\n\nEven if *Bocchi* might occasionally gift its protagonist too many easy victories, like with how convenient the solution to her problem of selling concert tickets during episode 6 was, its cast of characters still feels well realized and believable on every front that matters. It's a series filled with warmth and loveable treatment of its characters on top of featuring fantastic presentation throughout, unexpectedly growing larger than anyone could've imagined, which deservedly made it one of the most celebrated anime of the year.\n\nYou did it Bocchi. You really rocked the world. \\*puts on star-shaped sunglasses\\*",
