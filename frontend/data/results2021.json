Along the way we lost multiple good shows despite them receiving juror support such as, Black Clover, Godzilla: Singular Point, and Nomad: Megalo Box 2. While each show excelled in different areas, they were culled due to other nominations being stronger. Both *SSSS.Dynazenon's* and *Kingdom 3's* focus on characters, relationships, and narrative was well-regarded. Idaten-tachi and 86: Eighty Six had excellent direction, and the slow unraveling of their gritty worlds made each episode intriguing. There were shows whose fight scenes contained some of the most visually impressive animation of the year, such as Kimetsu no Yaiba: Mugen Ressha-hen  Fate/stay night [Heaven's Feel] III, Jujutsu Kaisen, and Gintama: The Final. \n \nThe finalization process was not an easy one due to the polarizing nature of some of our nominations.  After days of heated discussion, very few of us seemed willing to  budge. This ranking is a representation of what we believe to be the best action anime released this year.",

          "writeup": "*Kingdom's* third season is a masterclass of storytelling unfortunately held back by its average animation. Being historical fiction all the characters have roots in real life, and it does a good job making you understand why these people were important. The political machinations they use, the tactics and skills needed to overcome conflict, and the drive of each to achieve their own personal goals are enhanced by the larger-than-life presentation the anime creates, allowing them to feel like they stepped out of an epic, over a mere history book. \n\n\nAlthough much of this season's runtime is spent covering one conflict, that time is well spent. The slow rise of the action gives every front of the battle time to breathe, allowing every character to show off in their ensuing challenges. It captures a scale of combat normally glossed over in ancient war stories. There is still the ever-present anime tendency to have plot relevant characters do a lot of the heavy lifting, but tactics do play a large role in how the battles unfold as well. \n\n\nThe production unfortunately is relatively lackluster, and is average at the best of times, despite improvements from previous seasons. Large scale horse charges use CGI animals, wide shots that show off large sections of the battlefield tend to lack detail, and because this covers one conflict there is not much change in scenery over the course of the season. \n\n\nWhile lacking in sakuga moments, *Kingdom 3* is hard to put down. The handling of the story through it's narrative and characters makes it a must see for anyone with an interest in ancient China or history in general.",

          "writeup": "2022 had some big bombastic action movies, and while many left much to be desired; *Gintama: The Final* was thankfully one of the better ones. *The Final* is a well-crafted love letter to the franchise, full of call-backs, references, in-jokes, and a shocking amount of emotional weight to go with the humor and action. The big Gintoki fight scene was one of the more visually impressive and intricately choreographed battles, not just in the franchise, but in the action category overall. While this was the standout scene of the movie, sadly, this did not quite apply to the rest of the film's fairly standard animation.\n\n\nFurthermore, the movie, while great for *Gintama* fans, is not exactly a film for newcomers. One must be well-versed in the franchise to fully enjoy this picture. Even then, they might find the movie's structure rather disorientating as it starts with a rapid-fire parody recap and then just throws you into the deep end. That said, for those who are fans of *Gintama*, this movie has everything one could possibly ask for and it delivered this in the most appropriate and fitting way for the franchise. \n\n\nThus, while not perfect, this passionate farewell to *Gintama* certainly more than earned its 3rd place finish in Action.",

This of course refers to their latest Gridman Universe series of *SSSS.Dynazenon*. This phenomenal series combines the excellent character writing and story arcs of *SSSS.Gridman* with kinetic and hard-hitting action set-pieces that were both compelling to behold and entertaining to watch. Aside from dazzling the visual senses, the series' audio-based traits excelled as well, with top-notch seiyuu performances and amazing music and sound effects, setting an appropriate sense of scale for these literally larger than life sequences. \n\n\nSpeaking of which, the combining mecha versus Kaiju fights were populated with elaborate choreography and impressive cinematography; and furthermore, this series had the brains to go with its beauty as the interactions between the show's various cast members among one another kept things interesting and provided stakes for the audience to be invested in. The production values, while high overall, did suffer slightly due to the unfortunate use of CGI animation. However, Trigger's excellent cinematography and boundless creativity mostly overcame this trivial hurdle. \n\n\nFurthermore, the show's callbacks to events and characters hailing from both *SSSS.Gridman* and *Gridman The Hyper Agent* were integrated well into the show and all felt organic rather than ham-fisted or nostalgia pandering. Thus, *SSSS.Dynazenon* was a thought-provoking, and exciting Mecha series, as well as one of the year's best in the Action category. Thus, it is with great honor to report that this amazing series placed first in the Action category.",

However, this setup is used to subvert all expectations that one might have when watching it. This show is surprising in many different ways.\n\n\nThis show never stops, be it the plot or the animation. Being very stylish and dynamic, with great color design choices and editing transitions, it's hard to feel bored and uninterested when watching all the combat scenes that happen very often, but even the slower scenes feel very fluid. The plot is no different, with a constant change of scenarios and problems; it never stops moving forward. If the story has some down time where not much happens, *Idaten* is not afraid to completely skip to the good part.\n\n\nHowever, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. Even if *Idaten* is not afraid to make jokes, it goes places which are triggering to some people, like religion and, most commonly, rape and sex jokes. These jokes feel very out of place and don't serve much (if any) purpose to the story, and are ultimately a major turn-off.\n\n\nDespite its comedic flaws and an ending that left much to be desired, *Idaten's* excellent production and subversion of storytelling lets it finish in 7th place.",

Action sequences feel alive and each flow feels impactful thanks to smooth animation and sharp visual effects. Additionally, the soundtrack manages to convey the current mood of the scene, be it sad or hype moments.\n\n\nMost of the fame of Fate comes from characters and their struggles, and this entry is no different. While historical characters such as Rider or Saber had less focus than they deserved, this route's deep dive on modern-day cast members Shirou and Sakura is very commendable. We experience their inner-workings and what in life led to current events, offering an immersive character drama.\n\n\nOverall, *Fate/Stay Night [Heaven's Feel] III* offers immersive enjoyment due to its stunning visuals and interesting main cast. As a result, it lands in second place, barely missing the higher ranking due to some missed opportunities.",

The film is filled to the brim with some of the most exciting, high-quality action scenes in the category. Director Haruo Sotozaki and his team pour in all the talent and passion they have to generate as much hype into the action as they can with superb animation, choreography, and sound design. The animation isn't just superb in the action scenes, but in the emotional character acting scenes as well. \n\n\nWhile the animation and action were a source of praise, there was little in the story and character department. The film's plot is simplistic for its tone and doesn't differentiate itself from the rest of shounen anime. Additionally, the film does little to add depth to the already basic cast from the TV series. However, the addition of Rengoku Kyoujuro is very welcome, bringing an entertaining personality to several scenes.\n\n\nOverall, *Kimetsu no Yaiba* brings enough entertainment for two hours to satisfy fans of the TV series and shounen fans alike to earn a nomination in this category.",

          "writeup": "*86: Eighty-Six* is a hard-hitting war story that truly stands out. Its plot is incredibly well paced, production is on point, and the voice actors really deliver. As the audience we learn new information and twists at the same time as the protagonist. That is used to create scenes that take their time to show how the MC is feeling, something very uncommon in anime.\n\n\nLena, the protagonist, is superbly well written, with praise-worthy character development throughout the season. The rest of the cast is not lacking in development either, with the character-driven approach to worldbuilding making the cast feel real. Unfortunately, there are many characters that end up being underutilized with their stories being cut short. Some deaths have little to no weight to them and that ends up feeling somewhat out of place with how impactful the others are.\n\n\nThe battles in this anime are a low point, regrettably. The mechas are different from the usual fair; the mechas from The Legion have awesome looking designs. But the mechas from the 86 are too similar to each other, making it a bit difficult to identify them in the middle of a battle. They are also CGI; although not badly made, it can still put some people off.\n\n\nWith beautiful backgrounds, excellent framing, the use of “cameras”, and shots inspired by live-action rules, scenes can flow very well when there's a lot of movement while also having time to breathe when they need to. The story is neither rushed nor sluggish, and does a great job at setting up whatever is in the future for the series.",

Despite this, it still feels like a collection of standardized battle shounen tropes with little originality. *Jujutsu Kaisen's* curse energy techniques feel akin to power systems seen in other long running shows such as nen in *Hunter x Hunter* or stands in *Jojo's Bizarre Adventure*. While not original, the creativity and variety of abilities, when paired with excellent pacing and seamlessly interwoven backstories, can make for a truly spectacular experience like episode 17.\n\n\n*Jujutsu Kaisen's* focus on minuscule details such as the character's subtle body movements helps convey the inter-character relationships and gives the main characters a decent amount of depth. Unfortunately, the insipid supporting characters are void of development. Despite this, quite a few are impressionable, or at the very least relatable. Pacing inconsistencies were present for the introductory arcs in the first half. However, the tournament arc in the second half gave the show a chance to breathe and allowed each character a time to shine with smartly written battles oozing with flair.\n\n\nThe groundwork has been laid for what could potentially be one of the best battle shounens we have seen in awhile. *Jujutsu Kaisen* was one of the more highly anticipated series of 2021, and Mappa's stellar production has phenomenally enhanced almost every facet of the source material, landing it in a respectable 5th place.",

It is hard to express the breadth of emotions that anyone might experience during their formative years, but *Yoru no Kuni* comes close.  It follows three young girls in different stages of adolescence and pivotal moments they experience in the strange Night World under the guidance of Yoru.\n\nChiyu is an elementary-aged girl who grapples with death for the first time when her dog passes away. She's whisked away to the Night World where she meets the ethereal Yoru, who helps her confront her feelings.  The story continues with Tsumugi, a middle schooler dealing with jealousy, and Akatsuki, a recent college grad having just suffered another job application rejection.  They're all poignant depictions of deeply relatable events.\n\nThe Night World itself is a beautifully realized dreamscape that uses music and color to heighten emotion.  The soft glow that the stars give off contrast brilliantly with Yoru's pure black body.  The soundtrack uses violin, piano and harp purposefully to heighten the magic of the show.  Yoru's large, wing-like arms are both strange and welcoming, inviting the girls into their embrace.\n\nEvery minute of this short experience is profound. It doesn't overstay its welcome or become preachy. It accomplishes what it set out to do perfectly.  *Yoru no Kuni* is a triumph, and its second-place finish reflects that.\n",

The first has no action, focusing on the politics and diplomatic agreements the series is known for. The story is the best part, especially Shiroe and Rayneshia's scenes. Unfortunately, the pacing was a big problem for this arc, there were too few interesting moments to justify its length.\nThe second arc is even weaker, focusing on only a couple of familiar characters. Instead, the second arc introduces many new characters at once that aren't very memorable. The animation of the show in general wasn't very good, but the second arc has the worst of it with its action-oriented focus. There are many still frames, a big flaw for an action-oriented segment.\nThe final arc was an improvement. This arc gave the younger members of Log Horizon and Akatsuki time to shine. The action carries this section of the show. The final fight is just as climactic as a season finale should be. Minori and Akatsuki's touching scene is the icing on the cake.\n*Log Horizon* has many strong moments this season, especially in the first and last arc.

His task in his new life is simple: kill the hero that is prophesied to destroy the entire world.\nNeedless to say, this show presents a certain amount of flaws that hurt its overall reputation. Using Lugh as an anti-hero was initially a good idea, however, it was poorly executed since it doesn't provide any depth to its character. \nLugh's ability to continuously surpass all the obstacles he faces without any struggles gives away any potential for character development or an unique narrative. Certain themes like pedophilia or human trafficking are used as a tool to gather a cast of superficial and cliché female characters. \nUsing assassination elements such as, creating a magical sniper or using sneaking fighting styles to kill his subjects, was undoubtedly an interesting approach. However, as time passes, these abilities quickly become redundant and stale, as Lugh begins to use rather furtive and straightforward methods in order to defeat his enemies. \nFurthermore, the production value of this show is also underwhelming, as the further we progress the more the audio-visual quality decreases.\nFor the reasons previously stated, this story loses out compared to other nominations as the plot suffers from a lack of originality, with a cast of shallow and uninteresting characters and a show with a predictable outcome.\n",

Beloved studios including Trigger and Science Saru try their hand at evolving the worlds in the galaxy far, far away, unfettered by preexisting worldbuilding, and do so with mixed success.\n\nEpisodes like \"The Twins\" and \"Lop and Ocho\" are very familiar to anime fans.  The former has Trigger director Hiroyuki Imaishi's signature style and hype, while the latter is an endearing story about love and family.  Each expertly uses its runtime to give just enough context and maintain a sense of wonder while subtly building deep characters.  Some episodes were more controversial, such as \"The Duel,\" with its daring artistic style that some could find off-putting.  The biggest miss of the series, \"Tatooine Rhapsody,\" doesn't quite match the tone of the rest of the show.\n\nMany of the narratives detail the journeys of new or upcoming Jedi, which develops a kind of rhythm in the show.  \"The Ninth Jedi\" is especially evocative, following a lightsaber smith's daughter finding her way amongst other chosen Jedi.  \"TB-01\" pays clear homage to the classic *Astro Boy* in both its story and TB-01's design.  Geno Studio executes Lop's complex, innovative character design from \"Lop and Ocho\" perfectly, even in action scenes.\n\nThe quality of *Star Wars: Visions* is certainly shaky at times, but its highs soar higher than many other shows do in multiple cours.  For Star Wars fans, animation studio aficionados, or just anyone who likes anime, *Visions* is worth checking out, and its inclusion among the year's best Adventures is well-deserved.\n",

Perhaps that fan service is the main driver of this story.\n\nDespite these flaws, this season was filled with exciting and epic battles and a better story pacing, which is why it fully deserved the fourth spot on the list.\n",

Senku's side of the story revolves around his understanding of the world, and his optimistic views powered by science in the face of overwhelming odds.

          "writeup": "*Pui Pui Molcar*, a charmingly odd little show, packs a lot into each two-minute episode. The show maintains a stream of gags from start to end, enhanced by the unique stop-motion presentation. Each episode contains plenty of surprises, which range from a somewhat mundane traffic jam to time travel. \n\n\nThe show's comedy is fairly easy to get into, relying heavily on visual gags since the Molcars, and occasional plot-relevant humans, only ever squeak or make noises to imply an emotion. As such, this quick nature leads to a lack in nuanced character development, yet it may be especially preferable given the show's premise. Alternatively, it can lack depth at times due to this, but it has enough going on where it largely goes noticed by the end of any given episode. \n\nAdditionally, the show incorporates well-handled pop culture references that are usually restricted to the background, with the exception of a magical girl and *Back to the Future* reference. Although not a huge part of the show, the references give a small nod to those who notice them. \n\n*Pui Pui Molcar*'s effective use of its runtime and rapidfire comedy makes it a strong contender for this year. The energy, unique design, and use of stop motion allow the show to stand out, even among the full-length shows that often overshadow shorts. With the entire show being watchable in under an hour, it is a joy that easily fits into any schedule, and thus fits snuggly into second place.",

          "writeup": "Coming into the summer 2021 season, it was easy to miss this hidden comedic gem. Despite being an isekai, *Meikyuu Black Company* broke away from many overused elements of the genre. The plot loosely connects as the story changes unexpectedly and swirls the audience into action. One such arc switches the setting and presents a new short-term goal with additional characters. Not only does this prepare the audience for a fresh experience, it also presents the characters with varied situations and opportunities for comedy.\n\nHowever, there are drawbacks to this. All arcs' goals are ultimately shallow to compensate for its pace. As the next arc begins, it frantically jumps to another, thus leading to undeveloped moments. The show is dependent on its gimmicks, from “we need to go there!” to “we need to defeat this boss!” without much elaboration.\n\nStill, the way the cast was crafted and presented makes the show stand out amongst the oversaturated genre, even more so than the story. *Meikyuu* is not afraid to show characters their rotten and problematic personalities, such as Ninomiya's lack of work ethics. Each interaction does not play things safe, but rather brings personalities to the extreme for great comedic effect.\n\nAs each character shows off their absurdity, each episode becomes crazier as it goes on, and in a good way. The tight comedic timing and contrasting characters hyperbolize tension, before ending it all with a chilled-out ED. Therefore, *Meikyuu Black Company* lands strongly in third place for this category.",

The exchange of a deep, intricate plot for a more relaxing, slow story is exactly what *Slime Taoshite 300-nen, Shiranai Uchi ni Level Max ni Nattemashita* does, and it is successful in doing that.\n\nThe cast is quite diverse, having many fantastical races alongside character tropes. Seeing their interactions as they somewhat become family is endearing, and many great jokes complement those moments. However, in order to achieve that, the characters end up being rather simplistic, which has its strengths and weaknesses. It helps the show achieve its serene atmosphere while maintaining the audience's enjoyment, yet it can also make the plot predictable and slightly stale.\n\nMoreover, production can be better. Despite some scenes exceeding expectations in animation, the majority of the show's visuals are passable. Nevertheless, other production values are effectively unique, like the voiced sound-effects that greatly improve the show's comfortable ambience. This shows the careful considerations put into the show.\n\nWhile *Slime Taoshite 300-nen* has its flaws, it still manages to be an entertaining and funny show that is great to watch as a de-stressor, thus capturing fourth place.",

It manages to surprise the audience by breaking up the usual flow of comedy and subverting the viewers' expectations. Unfortunately, the show does not explore these emotional moments often, and the comedy can be hit or miss.\nMost of the jokes in the show fall into two types. Miko either tries to hide her reaction from the ghost or a misunderstanding occurs, as people who cannot see the ghosts are left confused by Miko's behavior. In relying on these two plot ideas, the enjoyment is largely dependent on personal preference. In addition, the production elements do little in aiding the comedic moments. The directing deprives the jokes of any impact, with numerous fanservice shots during tense scenes that flaw the parody horror show. Moreover, the art style and character design lack emphasis and do not quite stand out, losing the opportunity to effectively use it given the show's premise. In contrast, the monsters are memorable with their nice designs, even despite the limited runtime dedicated to each.\nAs such, while the premise is interesting with some decent moments, *Mieruko-chan*'s flaws and lack of comedic variety bring the show to eighth place.",

And much like last time, the cast continues its quest to save Saga and deliver some hard-hitting, emotional beats while everyone is laughing. By this, MAPPA demonstrates that lightning can strike twice, as this sequel builds off of the foundation and the strengths of *Zombie Land Saga*.\n\n*Revenge* thus soars to even greater heights, with the voice actors delivering impassioning and entertaining performances. Indeed, several standouts include Producer's hammy antics and THE LEGENDARY YAMADA TAE's guttural roars as the obligated mindless zombie of the bunch. Furthermore, hilarious, though plot-related moments are prevalent, a notable one being the zombie idols clawing out of debt through part-time jobs and sheer dumb luck.\n\nFurthermore, the CGI improves from that seen in season one, as there are some effective and creative uses of it, like Yamada Tae going all in on a drum kit. The show also features more than just laughs, namely the amazing music and heartfelt episodes featuring Yuugiri's backstory to further signify its impact.\n\nOverall, *Zombie Land Saga: Revenge* is a great success and a worthwhile watch.

The show is polarizing, though, due to its style of humor and plot development from the early stages. \nNagatoro herself is a decent character, with good voice acting and character animation to highlight her personality. Yet, the base of her relationship with Naoto is contentious, as the line of her teasing being fun and toxic varies despite later developments on her character.\nOn the other hand, Naoto stands as the largest issue of the anime. His overall demeanor and reactions to Nagatoro's teasing make for a predictable and uncomfortable experience, diminishing its potential. It is particularly frustrating when there are hints of their relationship progressing, all for it to be reset by Nagatoro accusing Naoto of being a pervert instead of changing the formula. However, in the final arc Nagatoro is upfront about helping her senior to compete against the art club's president, with the hints of Naoto and Nagatoro getting slowly closer to each other becoming clearer, thus making for more pleasant interactions than the usual teasing.\nIn the end, the relationship of the main duo and nature of humor overshadows most of the show. However, it is appreciated that there is development in their relationship to various degrees, as well as the good use of the medium for a successful adaptation, which ultimately lands the show in sixth place.",

The OVA is more of what the audience already loves about the series, so expect good quality production and the highest grade of jokes.\n\nThe first half differs in tone than previous seasons with its prevalent sexual themes. It parodies the fan service culture that many other shows have, and to do that it properly uses the cast to set up great jokes. There is even a moment where the OVA goes back and forth, between Ishigami and Shirogane reading a manga and Chika and Kaguya taking a shower, that is used to joke on anime censoring and is well done with its great comedic timing. However, reception to this part may be mixed due to the jokes being made, given the premise and its themes.\n\nConversely, the latter half is one big skit that foregoes the sexual themes and returns to what *Kaguya-sama* is best at. Character interactions are excellent, and the jokes land easily. There is one specific joke with Chika that is rather lengthy and repeated, though it does not interfere other scenes from being funny and enjoyable.\n\nWhile the *Kaguya-sama OVA* has many aspects fans know and love about the series, other nominees stand stronger this year, earning it a fifth place.",

The smooth animations, effective framing, and complementing OST all help this show standout from other rom-coms. Moreover, the voice actors perform splendidly with such an expansive cast, as each character has a voice that perfectly matches their identity.\n\nHowever, the cast and its interactions feels lacking at times. The main trio receives most of the attention and ends up being an excellent part of the show, but the secondary characters feel one dimensional and flat. Such interactions with them often were for one-off jokes, of which tend to be rather lengthy. Additionally, character progression is largely minimal throughout the show, even for the main characters.\n\nFurthermore, many of the jokes that worked well in the manga did not translate as nicely to the anime. They often feel “ported” rather than adapted to fit more appropriately. Signs, arrows, and other manga expressions are effective, but as an anime it does not use enough continuous movement and sound to convey the jokes more properly.\n\n*Komi-san* is a decent anime overall, though the flaws of character shallowness, minimal character progression, and ineffective adapted scenes lead to its seventh placement.",

Characteristic of director Naoko Yamada's style, it utilizes gorgeous cinematography and flowery metaphors to bring the powerful emotions and themes, especially the buddhist understanding of impermanence, to the forefront. Between the Heike's struggle for power and the art of Shirabyoshi courtesans, *Heike Monogatari* beautifully captures an image of courtly life in the late Heian period. \n\nDespite its cinematic strengths, *Heike Monogatari* struggles to make its vast cast individually relatable. The script moves too quickly from one event to the next, and doesn't leave enough room for everyone to have a compelling arc. The story occasionally requires familiarity with the historical setting for aspects of the characterization to resonate, even leading to confusion about the power and allegiances of characters. Similar character names and designs also contribute to this confusion. Biwa is a controversial protagonist lacking agency for the majority of the story, but is crucial for the thematic and emotional framing of the whole work. Lastly, the OST's usage of modern elements like EDM and rock music hampers the tone of the series set by high quality visuals.\n\nAltogether, *Heike Monogatari* remains a beautiful tragedy, delivering on powerful and complex themes of impermanence of existence, intergenerational injustice, and religious salvation. It's placement as fifth is a testament to the strength of the Drama entries this year.",

          "writeup": "The beginning of *Wonder Egg Priority* is truly excellent, offering some of the best production of the year alongside an engaging plot that tactfully addresses serious but rarely discussed topics. Suicide, self-harm, and trauma are touchy subjects and often mishandled, but early on *Wonder Egg Priority* tackles the subject with poise and nuance. This is largely due to the cast, which is wonderfully constructed with realistic dynamics and a core message of overcoming trauma through solidarity and personal bonds.\nUnfortunately, cracks start to show in the ending. The science fiction elements feel very half-baked in a story more magical and personal than anything else, and introducing a major plot thread so late in the narrative left little time to resolve it. Indeed, this thread is left unresolved, stranding audiences on the unlikely hope for a sequel. The last episodes do offer legitimate resolutions to the immediate arcs of the main girls. The finale in particular delves heavily into Ai, not only closing her initial arc, but introducing a conflict that would shape a second season deftly intertwined with the evolution of her character.\nEven if the story can be criticized, *Wonder Egg Priority* is a legitimately fantastic production. Sound design is somewhat hit-or-miss, with the mixing being very off at times, but the OST itself is filled to the brim with excellent and varied tracks. The visual production is superb, offering equal parts vivacious character animation and visually stunning high-action sakuga set pieces, in combination with standout cinematography - featuring superb choreography, meaningful framing, and stellar editing.",

It is a story of personal development, from simply going with the flow to daring to march in time with the beat of his own heart. This is exhibited in his art pieces, which encapsulate a living presence. Unfortunately, Yatora's vibrantartwork is an awkward juxtaposition against otherwise bland visuals of the show.  For an anime focusing on art, it is an ironic weakness to see such flat motion and lackluster composition.\n\nFortunately, its strength in character writing extends to create a lively cast. Supporting characters not only complement Yatora's story but carry a sense of depth and individuality despite their short time on screen. They are portrayed as real humans with struggles, like Ryuji, who grapples with their identity. That vulnerability in turn invites the audience to relate to each of the characters. \n\n*Blue Period's* strong narrative and complex characters allow the series to truly excel as a coming of age story with prominent themes of self-discovery, introspection, and personal development.",

Nonetheless, *Nomad: Megalo Box 2* surprises viewers with a timeskip that sent our champion Joe on a more personal journey focused on redemption and the importance of having a place to call home. The focus shifts out of the ring and onto Joe's interpersonal relationships, fleshing out his character in a manner sorely missed in season one. \n\n*Nomad* excels at introducing nuance to its characters and themes. The plot carefully handles complex and contemporary issues ranging from racism to corporate tech giants. Joe and the rest of the cast navigate these gray areas with a variety of perspectives and experiences befitting of their sensitivity. Through these intricate conflicts, *Nomad* showcases the strength of its cast and storytelling. It was awe-inspiring to see how *Nomad* intertwines the stories of Joe, Chief, and Mac, while commenting on larger ethical dilemmas. The only knock against the series' stellar narrative is that it stretches itself too thin at times, trying to cover too many conflicts in 13 episodes. Even so, *Nomad* wraps up Joe's story again in a way that is just as satisfying as his season one triumph. \n\n*Nomad* succeeds in pivoting from an action-heavy sports story into a character-driven drama, improving on the weaknesses of its first season. The production distinguishes itself even among the other diverse nominees, utilizing nostalgic visuals and songs sung in Spanish. This sequel is the complete package and a deserving champion of drama anime in 2021. ",

          "writeup": "*Beastars 2* is the much-anticipated sequel to 2019's Best Drama winner, and with many arcs and mysteries left unresolved, was well-positioned to repeat many of its predecessors' strengths seamlessly. The series captivates viewers just as much the second time around with its innovative 3D animation, world-building, and lead characters.\nThat being said, many of the deviations from the first season don't quite reach the same heights. Beastars' strong supporting cast is pushed to the side as the plot moves away from Cherryton Academy, leaving beloved characters like Juno and Haru underutilized. The arcs of Louis and Legoshi develop in enjoyable but absurd ways that stretch beyond the believable, leading up to a finale that is a bridge too far for many.\nIt is a testament to Beastars' world-building that its ambitious social commentary is seamlessly integrated into the show through the lens of carnivore-herbivore relationships. With the show so rich in themes, it is praiseworthy how the development of its politics never feels labored. This skilful interweaving of narrative and theme is best exemplified by Louis and Legoshi's navigation of ‘human' nature, and the parallels between them, producing a well-developed and captivating friendship.",

With unrivaled quality in numerous aspects, it gives Evangelion the send-off it deserves as one of the most defining anime ever made. \n\nThe overall aesthetic of the film is perfect. Iconic shots are just as grandiose and awe-inspiring as they are intimate and warm. Varying color values and hues create atmospheric perspective and intensify emotional impact. The typefacing also gives this film a memorable quality that is immediately defining. Topping it all with a great ending song, the look and feel screams Evangelion through and through.\n\nStellar artistry is complimented by an equally stellar plot, especially in its beginning and ending. A calming section at the start captured the cast's intimate and human moments. It provides a much needed grounding for the characters in Evangelion. The final segment of the film is truly next-level. It gives long-awaited closure to Shinji's development, as well as the people around him. The symbolism and meta abstraction throughout is not done pretentiously, but in a rather innovative and clever way. However, while the two ends of the story are great, the middle action sequence drags on for too long, featuring confusing and nonsensical sci-fi jargon.",

Communication as a core theme from the Violet Evergarden series continues to be a focus of the film, with memorable moments of letter-writing and heart-to-heart conversation. Scenes with Violet's client, Yuris, were far and away the best moments, and brought many people to tears. As can be expected from Kyoto Animation, top notch visuals and OST are major highlights of the film.\n\nThe inclusion of numerous story elements served to undermine the main Violet Evergarden series, in addition to unnecessarily prolonging the film. The most condemning of which was that the major twist came across as hollow, completely unnecessary to most, and detracted from Violet's overall character growth. While the execution of the twist was fine, its ramifications were controversial at best, despite the end result tugging at the heartstrings. The movie also felt too long, and some scenes could have been easily cut without losing much, especially those involving Anne's granddaughter, who didn't add much to the film.\n\nThe *Violet Evergarden Movie* has some incredible standout moments, but their integration into the main story could have been executed better. Kyoto Animation's final Violet Evergarden work brings an imperfect, yet enjoyable, conclusion to Violet's story.",

As such it is far from uncommon for shows with romance as a secondary focus to be considered for best of the year. This year was no different, with shows like *Tsuki to Laika to Nosferatu* or *Kanojo mo Kanojo* being viewed positively and getting rather close to being nominated, and Mewkledreamy actually making the cut. \n \nOn the other hand, this year was rather rich with movies focusing around romantic development with entries such as *Kimi wa Kanata* or *Cider no You ni Kotoba ga Wakiagaru* both being on the table, not to mention the nominated *Josee to Tora to Sakanatachi* and *Omoi, Omoware, Furi, Furare*. \n \nAt the end of the day the selection may have been rather narrow, but the discussion certainly did not reflect the limited field as once more the romance category had a record breaking number of messages, discussing each option in-depth. This includes entries that didn’t make the cut such as *Taishou Otome Otogibanashi* and the *Given Movie*. Do not be fooled by the ranking though, the competition was fierce and aside from first place, each entry was a strong competitor with the entries around it. \n",

The main characters experience and learn to live with love and rejection, in the hopes of learning how to find a little more happiness.\n\n\n\nThe story introduces a haphazard love square featuring the childhood friends of Yuna and Kazuomi, who meet newly-related step siblings Akari and Rio. Akari and Yuna quickly strike up a friendship, and their increasing involvement in the other's lives lead to sparks flying with their respective pairing. The film strongly focuses on overcoming existing trauma on Akari and Rio's part, while Yuna (and to a lesser extent Kazuomi) is used to help Akari and Rio deal with their own feelings of rejection. An incestuous relationship is handled excellently with dignity and maturity, and the importance of communication between partners is re-visited time and time again. Despite the impactful themes it explores, a shift in character focus results in a jarring transition mid-way through the film.\n\n\n\nOf the nominees this year, *Omoi* excels when it comes to background art, cinematography, and OST. These production elements take character dynamics and a simplistic story concept to another level. The highly technical musical score introduces, carries, and responds to significant relational moments on screen, pairing melodic variation with the characters' inner voices.  Overall, the production quality does its best to elevate cliché developments, but *Omoi* ends up falling short of greatness.",

After a talking stuffed animal falls from the sky into her arms she gains the ability to enter people's dreams.\n\n\n\nThis magical girl aspect is when the show is at its weakest though. While the exploration of characters through their dreams does help flesh out the personality of each feature character, the resolution to each episode is always the same and rarely satisfying. Also, the fact that only Yume is allowed to enter people's dreams severely limits character interactions and makes the rest of the cast feel unimportant.\n\n\n\nDespite this, *Mewkledreamy* manages to mostly successfully juggle its large cast of characters. Maira is utilized well as a vehicle for a lot of the show's comedy and much of the romance in the show revolves around Asahi, whom the show explores a lot through his interactions with Haruto, Rei, and Yume. However, other characters (Kotoko and Tokiwa for example) aren't explored as well. Yume isn't very complex on her own, but she shines through her relationships with the rest of the cast. In fact, the chemistry of the cast is one of the strong points of the show.\n\n\n\nThis chemistry fuels the show's greatest strength, comedy. It's particularly adept at using animation for visual gags, and although Maira's puns can be difficult to translate they allow her charming characterization to shine through.",

It's an impressive feat especially considering the incorporation of 3DCG and its strengths. *Bocchan* successfully uses 3DCG to provide us with intricate visual-comedy, camera direction, and imagery that compete on the levels of other nominees using the tried and tested 2D art style. \n\n\n\nHowever, the main strength of *Bocchan* lies in the portrayal of the relationships each character has with the Duke and with each other. The Duke's relationship with Alice, friends, and even his family are all endearing journeys of growth and development that are rare to find. A particularly charming motif throughout the show is the constant teasing from Alice, much to the embarrassment of the Duke. Not only does this help to characterize and build a rapport between the main couple, but it also retains narrative significance with regard to the Duke's curse. It doubles down as wholesome fan-service for the audience while also setting the baseline level of intimacy for their relationship which then evolves throughout the show to become more than just playfulness but genuine attraction between each other and a method of communicating romantic feelings.\n\n\n\nAs they journey together to break the curse, the friendships and bonds formed ease the struggles the Duke is bound by and provide us with a poetic show that makes us feel bubbly but also empathetic at times. An amazing show that caught us all by surprise and thus, 2021's Romance of the Year.",

Though they start off on rocky footing, they are able to slowly connect. Tsuneo is able to bring Josee out of her shell, and motivates her to pursue her dreams of being an artist. The chemistry established between the two leads was endearing, leading to cheers for their success throughout the film.

Evan Call's contribution on OST was also well received. Overall, this movie had a great combination of production and story, which is why *Josee to Tora to Sakana-tachi* is the second best Romance of 2021.",

Throughout the show Futaba is constantly confused for being a child, and it's no wonder considering she looks and often acts like one.  However, her actions and feelings will certainly remind you of what it felt like to enter the workforce for the first time, and this is a major strength of the show.  Underneath the hijinks, it does a remarkable job being a relatable story of how it felt to be new at a job, or living on your own for the first time.  Because when you are on your own, simple things feel impossible and you feel like you appear to people as a 5 year old.  Watching Futaba overcome this, and eventually be seen as a reliable worker and an adult by the titular senpai is one of the most compelling character arcs in the category.\n\n\n\nThe side characters also stand out, particularly Kazama and Sakurai.  The main couple in the show didn't really have the typical romantic relationship, so having another couple fill that void was definitely needed and appreciated.  While the story beats are familiar and the dynamic rather simple and predictable, it was executed very well, and the characters had clear chemistry.\n\n\n\nUltimately Senpai was one of the best romances of the year and was a worthy inclusion in the category.",

Its new production feels like a breath of fresh air compared to season one, with its character design shining very bright. Plot-wise, the show takes a dramatic turn, making it more engaging than ever.\n\n\n\nDespite its much more colorful palette, *5-toubun ∬* takes a much more dramatic approach to its story. The show's greatest strength is still the interactions between the sisters, but they're not executed in the same way as before. The idyllic, peaceful interactions of Season 1—while not completely gone—are now less prevalent. We're left instead with a plot much more focused on drama, conflict, and scheming. While this new direction might upset some viewers, for many it served to deliver a much more engaging and gripping product.\n\n\n\nThis doesn't mean the show is without its faults. The focal point of this conflict, Fuutaro, is about as interesting as one can expect from a nerdy and arrogant highschooler: not at all. The sisters, while certainly better, aren't great characters in their own right either, and often feel like exaggerated harem stereotypes. The show's attempts at comedy weren't particularly successful either. This is partially due to the dramatic focus of the season, but also because most of the humor stems from the sisters playing into the tropes each of them fits in, which gets repetitive.\n\n\n\n*5-toubun*'s stands out in a good way from the sea of generic harem anime.

With fifty episodes of getting to know these characters, it is no surprise that the emotional highs fit the occasion, and the show acts as a fantastic farewell to Tohru and friends.\n\n\n\nOnce again, Tohru is a compelling protagonist and is truly granted her moment to shine while navigating her relationship with the Sohmas. The show's large cast remains as vibrant as ever, with each character given opportunities to shine. While many of these arcs are romantic, the arcs remain both unique and distinct providing an excellent portrayal of many different varieties of love.\n\n\n\nWhile the highs of the story cannot be disputed, the pacing leaves much to be desired. While Akito is a compelling antagonist, her arc was often intrusive on other character's arcs and came across as too cliché to feel either nuanced or fully developed. It is hard not to imagine that Momiji and Yuki's arcs could use this time far better. These issues meant that some elements were introduced too hastily, only hitting the emotional mark due to Fruits Basket's otherwise deft use of melodrama.\n\n\n\nWith so many moments building beautifully on the momentum of the previous seasons, it is a delight to watch, more than lives up to its predecessors, and earns its position as 4th best in Romance of the year.",

The film takes the bouncy motion, hyper-exaggerated reactions, and rounded character design of the original series, and modifies it to make it feel modern and aged-up, all while keeping the youthful energy that makes it feel distinctly \"DoReMi\".\n\nHowever, that same association with Ojamajo feels somewhat tenuous within the narrative. The characters' connection to the series could've been replaced by any other interest and it still would've landed its thematic point.  This means that the connection doesn't feel directly necessary or meaningful to the story. Furthermore, the interaction with the original series's magical elements makes the film's more realistic drama sometimes feel out of place and tacky.\n\nNevertheless, the strength of the cast overshadows these small faults. Mire, Reika, and Sora are all charming leads in their own right. And while each fits into an established archetype, they all have decent nuance away from these roles to make them feel more balanced and whole. Yet, where they truly shine is their dynamic with each other and how, despite their differences, their mutual dissatisfaction with their lives draws them together in natural ways.

The film features a strong cast, with Gene's dedication and love for movies shining through. The titular Pompo is another standout character, with her serving as a great mentor for Gene throughout the film, and providing unique and bold takes on the film industry. \n\nThe film starts out strong, with character moments for Gene and Pompo that highlight the effort and passion needed to make a successful film. Gene and Pompo share a number of charming moments featuring their mentor-mentee relationship. However, the final third is notably weaker than the rest of the film. Individual scenes suffer from a variety of faults, from characters not suffering true consequences for their actions to scenes featuring over-the-top and outlandish ideas that end up breaking immersion. \n\nThe film's greatest strength lies in visual production, most notably the exceptional cinematography and creative visuals. The editing sequences with Gene are the standout moments, with vibrant color schemes and a strong portrayal of the editing required. Other highlights include the creative and fun transitions, such as windshield wipers, as well as framing techniques around watching a scene in a theater. *Pompo*'s strengths are among the best the category has to offer, and is more than deserving of its second place finish.",

On their warming journey pursuing their newfound dream, their friendship bonds strengthen as well as their fun day-to-day activities.\n\nWhat immediately stands out is that D4DJ is a full-3D CGI anime. While the series' technical use of the animation style is good and supports itself using 2D smear frames and sound effects, D4DJ's 3D animation still doesn't achieve the same appeal that 2D drawing does. \nThe character interactions are fun and lively, but lack the depth required for compelling dramatic arcs. The character conflicts are often quickly resolved with one encouraging conversation before the concert, then they proceed perform like nothing bothered them  leading to an underwhelming experience.\n\nThe use of music and quality of concerts was also polarizing, with the music varying from charming to annoying; the ambient of concerts having repetitive settings and low quality crowds. The dance performances, however, were of higher quality, displaying better use of its CGI accompanied with good choreography.\n\nIts cast and dramatic writing leave more to be desired, but it was overall a fun time with its silly humor and technical prowess with CGI. In what is a stacked year, *D4DJ First Mix* can proudly finish the race at 7th place.",

Works returns to the *Shirobako* franchise to make an anime movie about... making an anime movie!\n\nAs one might expect, the *Shirobako* movie maintains many of the original series's strengths – the memorable character designs like goth loli artist Ogasawara Rinko, strongly defined personalities like the well-meaning layabout Takahashi Tarou, and lovable character dynamics like that of the Don-Don-Donuts 5 all returning to make the movie entertaining and lighthearted.\n\nHowever, this ties into the entry's primary weakness: being excessively similar to the original series. While its expected for a sequel to pay homage to the successful original, the Shirobako movie at times feels like it's *only* a callback, perhaps best encapsulated in how vestigial the primary new cast addition of Kaede Miyaki feels to the affair. In addition, while the movie's plot is reminiscent of the original show's individual arcs, the movie's reduced runtime causes noticeable pacing issues.\n\nThat being said, *Shirobako* still captures the magic of making anime – from what's shown, the movie that MUSANI puts together looks genuinely interesting and fun – but in a category filled with strong competitors, its issues weigh down an ultimately still enjoyable affair from placing higher.",

The first half of the show covers daily life within an aquarium and the second half focuses more on workplace drama within the same setting. There is no consensus on which of these two halves is better. The first half is more focused on the central two characters within a smaller setting. Meanwhile, the increased number of dramatic moments in the second half create a more interesting story with new character developments. The common aquarium setting helps the show stand out and show how passionate the characters are towards aquatic life. The heart and soul of the show, however, lies with the strong bonds between the main characters, Kukuru and Fuuka.\n\nHowever, one major problem is the side characters, who, considering their screentime,  aren't developed. None of them are bad characters but most aren't fleshed out. The jarring transition between the two halves is another problem, the conflicts from the first half are irrelevant in the second half.\n\nDespite these flaws, *Aquatope* still has much to offer. The production of the show is one standout feature; especially, the compositing, backgrounds, character designs, and beautiful use of color. Although *Aquatope's* weaker aspects hold it back from the top spots, the strengths of the show still shine like a pearl, a very deserving nomination.",

It shows episodic stories without a clear timeline or connection of events while also making it clear that time is passing and youth is transitory, with their graduation looming closer. \n\nHotaru, Komari, Natsumi and Renge are spending their time together and enjoying their youth in the countryside to their fullest. Seeing them playing and laughing together is heartwarming. The new characters, Shiori and Akane, are a great fit in the cast and give the group an opportunity to explore new friendships. They all grow together through new topics like overcoming shyness and being more comfortable around people.\n\nThe main cast still stands in the spotlight and continues to have excellent chemistry. They manage to accept and overcome their weaknesses together, showing that asking for help is completely normal. NNB also excels at creating fantastic comedic moments, like Renge playing Santa delivering tomatoes, keeping the show lighthearted.\n\nThe show creates a calm and relaxing atmosphere by adding in segments without talking, letting the art and sounds of nature speak for themselves. The fantastic background art and OST also plays an important role in achieving that calmness.\n\n*Non Non Biyori: Nonstop* delivers fantastic Slice of Life moments with a high production quality creating an idyllic depiction of living in the country and enjoying youth.

The leads, Rin and Nadeshiko, are strong characters on their own, and the premise of “cute girls doing camping things” keeps everything as low-stakes as possible. While this gives the two girls a chance to explore their individuality in a setting devoid of drama, their heartwarming bond and natural chemistry is what's truly noteworthy. It's compelling, and honestly it's just fun. When paired with production values that emphasize realistic background art and lighting—showing off the natural beauty of Japan—and a dynamic and well-utilized OST, this season of Yuru Camp continues radiating the same feeling of “comf” that the series initially became known for.\n\nUnfortunately, \"comfiness\" in and of itself cannot be used to measure quality, and there are some weaker aspects of Yuru Camp. Relative to other characters, Ena, Chiaki and Aoi lack depth, and segments that place them at the forefront are sometimes underwhelming. Compositing is another weakness, with several instances of characters jarringly standing out against the background art, breaking immersion and detracting from the experience.\nHowever, these flaws do not seriously hold Yuru Camp back. Its strong depictions of nature, camping and friendship, as well as its appealing tone and atmosphere, outweigh its shortcomings. Ultimately, this season is easy to love, which is why it finds itself in a very solid and hard-fought for third place, amid what can only be described as stacked competition.",

All of this is packaged with both outstanding character animation and action sequences, making Maidragon one of our most visually appealing nominees.\n\nSome of the main weaknesses of the show were due to its comedy lacking in variety. Ilulu, for example, is a fantastic character whose arc is often interrupted by repetitive breast jokes. Kanna and Kobayashi's relationship delivers good slice-of-life moments, but their moments together are often intruded upon by Saikawa,whose character feels one-note and lacking in novelty value.\n\nYet, the slice-of-life and drama were performed admirably. Shota and Lucoa find opportunities to develop independently of one another. Kanna, too, finds some independence by traveling overseas. Elma and Tooru's backstory provides impressive character-driven drama. With these dramatic moments and stories interspersed with classic slice-of-life, it is hard not to find the show compelling, even if it struggles to find the balance between its parts.\n\nAs with the previous series, the show was held together by the enjoyable (and incredibly shippable) dynamic between Tooru and Kobayashi. By the end of the series, Tooru is a much more mature and independent lead, and her antics remain an utter joy to watch. Earning a well deserved 5th best Slice of Life of the year.",

From adaptations of sequels to hyped, established franchises like *Shingeki no Kyojin* and *Re:Zero Kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu*, to passionate, inspired originals like *Vivy: Fluorite Eye’s Song* and *Sonny Boy*, it’s hard to find a category that fills as many niches and covers as much subject matter as Suspense. \n \nEligible shows in the category this year faced a grueling battle royale for final nomination positions. Notable entries which didn’t make the cut included the second season of Production I.G.’s adaptation of *Yuukoku no Moriarty*, a reimagining of the Sherlock Holmes mythos, and *Bishounen Tanteidan* from the anime power pairing of studio Shaft+auteur NISIOISIN (responsible for the mega-hit *Monogatari* series and 2017 Thriller/Mystery winner *Kubikiri Cycle*). The exclusion of standalone marvels such as these shows puts into perspective the final nominees as the cream of this year’s crop. \n \nAs might be expected from a category with such a wide range of subject matters and themes, opinions were equally widely ranging on many of the nominated shows. Discussions ultimately reached a similar conclusion on the contenders for first place - a triple threat of originals in *Sonny Boy*, *Cocolors*, and *Odd Taxi* - with vocal support for all three. True to the category, the question of who would come out on top remained unanswered until the final vote was cast. \n",

The 3D animation manages to balance the yellows, reds, blacks, and grays of the setting against the colorful imaginations of the main characters. Each shot evokes a sense of eerie emptiness through its incredibly detailed backgrounds and unique character designs, while still feeling beautiful. Unfortunately, some of the voice actors do sound inexperienced at times, and the OST, while fitting, doesn't stand with the rest of the production. Still, the production manages to stand out among even the best shows this year.\n\n*Cocolors'* main conflict and character development puts this fantastic production to full use. Although some conflicts near the beginning are a bit over-dramatized, Aki and Fuyu's dynamic is awe-inspiring and the crux of the film. Aki's knowledge of the outside world as a member of the salvage unit contrasts perfectly with Fuyu's hopeful and innocent mind. The way their characterization grows and shifts in conjunction with one another, learning about and coming to terms with their bleak world is intensely emotional and strangely cathartic. The world, shrouded in mystery, serves its purpose in facilitating these characters, while also feeling grand beyond the scope of what is shown. *Cocolors* is a fantastic movie that despite its short length and lack of popularity manages to stand with the best stories in this medium.",

Deliberately hallucinogenic and nonlinear, *Sonny Boy's* narrative is nothing short of fascinating.

Its lack of a connecting storyline and relentless pursuit of nonlinearity, while wholly creative, dissuades viewers unwilling to engage with its abstraction.\n\nPhenomenal production and usage of visual direction more than compensates for the awkward narrative progression, strengthening the philosophical nature of the show. Every surrealist background creates a beautiful grandiose landscape, and Hisashi Eguchi's fantastically crafted designs serve both a simplistic yet incredibly effective narrative and aesthetic purpose. \n\n*Sonny Boy* is not for everyone, but it is the most thought-provoking and surreal original product to come out of 2021, and one to be appreciated for a long time. Its unbelievably crafted abstraction and hallucinatory visuals were more than enough to propel it into the top prize.",

Her journey of growth as a character is one of the biggest highlights for the entire cour. The exploration of the side cast through their individual arcs give a much needed insight on characters like Garfield, Beatrice and Roswaal not only making the story more intriguing but also solidifying the cast of Re:Zero as one of the best there is on offer. On the other hand, Roswaal makes for an intriguing antagonist but his existence often feels neglected to being a source of exposition and monologue for Subaru, rather than actually participating in the story leading to the resolving of his arc being somewhat anticlimactic. \n\nWith that being said, *Re:Zero 2nd Season Part 2* also comes with its own fair share of problems. While the flashbacks were a much needed addition to the story they at times harmed the pacing of the show by overstaying their welcome. *Re:Zero 2nd Season Part 2* also had subpar production quality compared to *Re:Zero 2nd Season* part one, where the heavy usage of jump cuts, motion tweens and off-model character designs regrettably draw attention to themselves thus ending up at 6th place in the jury rankings.",

The first arc of the season held the most impact, with a new cast of characters and exciting reveals. The ideologies of the cast are expanded on from earlier seasons, and antagonists have depth added to their characters in the process. Compelling action sequences host moments of insight into the broader world of the Titans, and draw the viewer into this continuation of the story. \n\nThe second part of the season is not as nearly as memorable or engaging as the first part. Although the detailed political aspects of this part provoke intriguing conversation, it is bogged down by a much slower pace and new characters that fail to leave an impact. \n\nThe production value of this season also felt weaker than its predecessors, particularly in its use of 3D animation, compositing, and coloring. The OST provokes little more than ambivalence, with the works of the show's new composer feeling lackluster in comparison to the OSTs of prior seasons. \n\nWhen this season of *Shingeki no Kyojin* hits its mark, it's a gripping ride, but unfortunately the weaker elements of the season made it difficult for the jury to place it higher than fourth in the rankings.",

The atmosphere goes from exceptionally goofy to extremely tense depending on the scene, and it makes for a varied, odd, and phenomenal environment with a great supporting soundtrack. Criticisms of the show relate to the visual production, namely the CGI being horrendous, backgrounds being rather bland, and sometimes, wonky character designs.

This gives viewers an opportunity to go through this reflective journey with him.\n\nThe relatable character development stems from how Yatora finds his purpose and how he expresses himself in art. The first five minutes of the series exhibit his uncaring attitude towards art until he is enthralled by the mystique of Mori's painting. Starting at that point, the audience develops an empathetic connection with him when he feels despair or joy in painting.\n\nThe relatability does come at the expense of exceptionality. Yatora undergoes the same journey of self-discovery as characters in many other works. Fortunately, the simple set-up of his character has inherent appeal, and his arc is shaped more by himself than by others. Rather than requiring a rival or an external force to motivate him, he grows due to his newfound passion, striving to improve both himself as a person and his work.\n\nYatora is deserving of 3rd place because he feels like a real human. Viewers are able to feel the emotions and life that he pours into each of his paintings, and can enjoy the victories as if they were with him.",

What's more, her growth and decisions are all informed by talking out her issues with her newfound friends. Reciprocating, Ai provides that same shoulder to lean on for the egg girls, as well as for Rika, Momoe, and, of course, Neiru.\n\nHowever, it was understandably difficult to interpret the final episode of the show, with some reading Ai's actions therein as an out-of-character regression instead of a character failing after being pulled in two different directions. Additionally, the speed at which the final scene arrives can be seen as one element of Ai's arc that ended up suffering due to *WEP*'s famously troubled production schedule.\n\nWhere the story of *Wonder Egg Priority* goes from here is anyone's guess.

The story depicts him as a new person who is capable of facing the inner demons birthed by the weak resolve of his past self, accepting them, and moving on. He fulfills his narrative and thematic role beautifully in relation to the cast and complements the other character storylines, which also act as a parallel to his own struggles.\n\nAt the same time, this parallelism comes at the expense of his story being less engaging and emotional, as he acts more as a foil for characterizing the rest of the cast. Especially so during the second half of the show, where Joe's personal journey comes to a halt. \n \nStill, this journey of reconciliation with himself and the people around him makes Joe remarkably different from who he was in season one. The self recognition, self recovery, and spiritual healing throughout this season mark the beginning of a humble life for Joe. He receives a new-found personality and a new life: a life where he is no longer the titular nomad, as he has a home to return to and people waiting for him. ",

Through his interactions with the villagers, he realizes there is more meaning to his life than the Eva, and this serves as a major foundation for his development at the climax. Finally, after this newfound discovery, it's poetic that he chooses to get back in the robot of his own volition.\n\nA large amount of Shinji's struggle with self worth and depression stems from his strained relationship with his father, and the major climax of the film is his confrontation with Gendo. As Shinji's character has never really found peace due to the lack of a resolution to this relationship, it's only fitting that Evangelion begins and ends with it.\n\nAfter finally having come to terms with himself and his role in the world Shinji pushes forward and fights a future that he chooses for himself, free from suffering and constant fighting. This perfect ending to his journey nets Shinji the position of best main dramatic character of 2021.",

While Vivy is not the first AI to grapple with human concerns like the soul or the heart, this rendition of that familiar story has some great moments.\n\nAn area of the story that offered exciting possibilities was the end of the third arc. Vivy watches a man commit suicide in front of her. The idea of seeing her have to come to terms with this development was interesting. Unfortunately, the show did not go in that direction, taking an easier path instead by having her be rebooted. Vivy's factory reset version, Diva, takes over and is largely in control during the fourth arc. \n\nThe biggest issue with the show, and our main character in particular, was with this change-up. Vivy's development had been progressing well, but this section of the story took the wind out of its sails. While Vivy does return, her arc has to make up for the stumble and does not stick the landing.

Given the varied nature of the cast, this is no small feat, but Odokawa manages to keep the story grounded and plausible. Perhaps more impressively, Odokawa manages all of this while keeping up a refreshing dynamic with each of the colorful characters that inhabit *Odd Taxi*'s world. Perhaps this is a result of his stoic, disaffected personality, his considerate cynicism, or even his dry disposition that ensures that he never hogs the spotlight—regardless of why he consistently manages to draw out the quintessential and most entertaining parts of the rest of the ensemble.\nThat being said, he is somewhat half-baked as a dramatic character. While Odokawa is indisputably the grounding rock of the narrative, this inert nature somewhat resists the thematic development typically associated with a dramatic character. While he does change in interesting and unique ways, he changes as a person rather than as a part of the greater story, which makes his arc feel a bit hollow, especially compared to the poignant changes experienced by the other characters.\nNevertheless, the crafting of his character is superb. In a medium dominated by teenagers, *Odd Taxi* boldly centers itself around a grouchy, cynical 40-year old, and this novelty itself has value, offering a unique perspective to support its message. These personality aspects are nuanced and well-characterized, and his age—aside from providing contrast with the cast—makes these personality aspects feel appropriate and reasonable.",

However, the pacing of his character development, along with his dynamic with each character introduced, sets him up to be an endearing character. The juxtaposition between Rudy and the world around him, as well as how it affects his growth and arc, was well explored. \n\nThe crux of the conversation is simply this: Rudy's moral degeneracy, specifically his pedophilia. This major flaw is detrimental to the viewing experience and hurt his otherwise decent bid at ranking higher on this list. This was due to the lack of clarity in his characterization—is his reincarnation simply the mind of an adult in a child's body?—and distaste at the lighthearted portrayal of such a delicate subject.\n\nRudeus is a decent character, with high potential, but not without issue. Due to the straightforward nature of his arc, along with some morally objectionable elements, Rudy doesn't place any higher than this.

Hence, Eren is a black box; we see the inputs and the outputs but his perspective is never shown. The show's cast—and by extension the viewers—are left to put the pieces together.

He receives his well-deserved comeuppance whenever it is merited, and he also does have a soft side that comes out at times. This soft side is never inconsistent with his core goals though. Whether any particular action of his will be agreeable or loathsome is a bit of a wildcard, but those actions are always entertaining.

From all of these examples, we can see how Tae Yamada is more than just a meme, as she's the unsung hero of her group and a fully realized character.\n\nThe amount of agency and respect afforded to her is heartwarming to see. She may be non-verbal, but Tae Yamada has dignity and an important role in the proceedings of her show. That said, it must be noted that while she did not have the most screen time out of the idols of Franchouchou, she made every second she had on screen count and delivered 120% effort on all of her humorous antics. Thus, THE LEGENDARY YAMADA TAE managed a commendable fourth place finish in Main Comedic.",

Her antics are bewitching and her childlike attitude coupled with her deadpan delivery and surprising maturity make for a character that's difficult to dislike.\n\nRenge's dynamic with Shiori is one of the strongest parts of this season, giving her a younger friend to bounce off. Renge's childlike excitement to be an older sister to Shiori is funny and the lengths she goes to be a good one is endearing. Her relationship with Akane is another highlight of the season. Renge pushes Akane to play games with her which leads to great gags. Renge is one of Akane's first real friends and she helps her make some big steps forward.\n\nLet's not forget Renge's relationship with the usual cast of characters either. Renge's dynamic with Natsumi and Hikage is fantastic. She acts as a little sister to both and they are very sweet to her in return, happy to play along with her games. Her dynamic with Candy Store, who bends over backwards to help Renge, is touching, and would not be an exaggeration to say they have the most heartfelt relationship in the show.\n\nRenge really stands out among the rest of the nominations as the most praised character by far. Beyond simply being a fun character to follow and creating heartfelt moments, her ability to carry her show, creating situations for other characters to shine in, is staggering. ",

Katarina, hereafter called Bakarina, more than lives up to her reputation and name in the most humorous of ways. Still under the delusion that her harem ISN'T in love with her, she cheerfully goes about her life while comically misunderstanding literally everything romance related.\n\nThis behavior is best exemplified during the Kidnapped Katarina Arc. While her harem is busy forging alliances and moving Heaven and Earth to track her down, Bakarina is happily treating this all as an extended vacation for her to laze about, read romance novels, eat sweets, and also charm and romance her captors Lima Syndrome Style. Much like before, Maaya Uchida continues to channel the overly eager moron that is Bakarina, as well as imbuing her with a sense of charm and genuine friendliness. Of course, Maaya Uchida's range extends to being able to bring the smug Ojou-sama to life, seen best during the play where, true to form, Bakarina forgot her lines and thus resorts to repeating her Villainess one-liners to the crowd's adoration.\n\nSadly, while clearly the high point of her show, the second season's weaker writing and missteps with the romantic progression hurt her overall ranking. She also did not reinvent the metaphorical wheel, relying mostly on her pre-established Season 1 gags. Regardless, she still managed a respectable sixth place finish in Main Comedic.",

She is always one to neglect her own health in order to help out those she cares about whether it's an overreaction or not. \n\nTo sum it up, Tooru acts as the glue that holds the family together.

But, behind this facade is the ultimate glass cannon, a girl with a crush who is all bark and no bite. \n\nThe situations Nagatoro proactively presents come across as consistently funny, cringey, and charming in equal measure. She's earnest and transparent enough to the viewer (if not to Senpai) that embracing the invited fantasy of a cute girl paying *any* amount of attention to you is very easy. However, when her veneer fades, we see her goal of true romance and the unspoken desires she's too ashamed to admit.

It is touching to see how that relationship remains strong, with Hikage helping Natsumi even when they were young kids and dressing up as a villain in their games.\n\nHowever, she does have some failings. Hikage's largest problem is that she is locked into these dynamics, not interacting nearly as often with other cast members like Hotaru and Komari. She is not always the highlight of her scenes either, usually serving as a straight man to the bigger personality of Natsumi. Thus, Hikage is not as complex or as impactful a character as she could be, staying as a foil to Natsumi and being a good sister primarily.\n\nDespite these flaws, there is much to like about Hikage. The gap in her maturity level and how she desires to be represented is very endearing, creating some great gags. She is relatively level headed, but Natsumi can change that, and the two get up to hilarious hijinks. Some great examples include them waffling over the decision to do their summer homework as well as them attempting to shirk their responsibilities when they break Natsumi's mom's vase, terrified of the ramifications. \n\nWhile Hikage's simple characteristics keep her from placing higher, her strong emotional core and hilarious moments place her in sixth.",

Anno and Khara deliberately insert a coy, self-aware character into the *Eva* rebuild films, one who flirts with mocking the tone while flirting with a mocking tone. Whether that is cringe or cool is neither here nor there. What is undeniable is that Mari does not fit in.\n\nThough she fights alongside the cast, stuck in the same maddening quagmire of a technobabble plot, Mari lacks the tell-tale crippling hyper-fixation, immaturity, or personal flaws of an *Evangelion* character. She is the only sane person who falls into a series that has been dominated by emotionally broken man-children since the mid-'90s.\n\nPrecisely because of her difference, though, she enables *Evangelion*'s metaphor for breaking out of depression and self-destructive mindsets. She showcases a stable worldview, one perspective able to stave off the absurdity of existence. And that stability allows Shinji to rise above the insanity that trapped him to finally move forward.\n\nHowever, concerns over Mari's lack of development and agency in relation to the movie's plot may arise. Her activeness and interactions also may appear undeveloped due to little screen time. Despite these concerns, she successfully ruins everything known as *Evangelion*, precisely as intended. For a woman bearing the names of a traitor and prostitute, for a series that grew up with its creator and with us all, there could be no better final message.  ",

While overlapping with Yatora's arc, Yuka's character is not tied to him. Therefore, when their paths cross, their interactions feel genuine and not forced. Despite being considered a supporting character, Yuka never feels like one. The three-episode-long arc is not merely a one-sided opportunity to highlight Yatora's growth but also to explore Yuka as a real person, recontextualizing much of what is shown in the opening episodes. \n\nAs expected from a show about art, *Blue Period* excels at visual symbolism. Nowhere is this more apparent than the clothing, representing the facade Yuka hides behind. Yuka's identity is couched in general themes of non-conformity, and *Blue Period*'s depiction of gender identity is nuanced and deliberately vague.",

On the other hand, he will do anything in order to follow his principles, even to the extent of sacrificing innocent people simply because he does not want a “butterfly effect” to occur. \n\nMaking a character seem cold, heartless, and unsympathetic for most of the show while also making them charismatic, funny, and likable is a fine line to walk. In this case, however, it succeeds. Matsumoto's friendship with Vivy is endearing, and it is great to watch him slowly develop empathy. \n\nEven so, he lacks depth outside of “sticking to his principles,” impacting his development. He may also appear annoying sometimes, as he continuously reminds Vivy that her actions will “save the world.” A reminder every once in a while is sufficient, though repeating it in nearly every episode becomes redundant and diminishes its emphasis. \n\nDespite his simplicity, Matsumoto's overall interactions with Vivy, his comedic lines, and how he begins to see AI's and peoples' lives as less expandable as the show progresses, alleviate his flaws.

While the former is often grasping at straws for solutions, Odokawa manages to find a path forward with the given information. Tanaka instead jumps at the easiest solution, be that an obsession with collecting a rare, though meaningless item or outright murder. He only turns himself around through the sheer coincidence of running into Dobu, confronting Tanaka with the fact that nothing that happened to him was more than just dumb bad luck, and he is finally able to let go of his previous obsessions by the end.\n\nSome criticism may arise that Tanaka's arc is not directly connected to other characters beyond chasing them and that his story wraps up without much explanation in the finale, leaving little character development. While he is an interesting addition to the series that shake up the slowly forming expectations, these factors lead Tanaka to fifth place.",

With that said, Otto, who is driven by his will to help his friends, is a quick-witted, loveable, honest, and all-around fantastic character. He is shown to have a backbone, especially when it comes to calling out Subaru's wrongdoings while pulling him out of hopeless situations by offering his help as a friend. He is straightforward and sometimes even brutally honest, yet all of it is not out of malice, but rather out of benevolence. He is mostly powerless, though he is still able to fend off Garfiel, an opponent much stronger than him, by using the environment around him which shows his ability to think on his feet.\n\nAlthough Otto appears shallow and his backstory not being particularly unique, he is still great overall. His resilience, honesty, and kindness highlights him as what many consider “best boy” of the cast. Therefore, Otto lands safely into fourth.",

Giving characters agency then having them deal with the results of their choices never gets old, and the show loves to play in this space. Nowhere can we see that better than the demon warrior Ruijerd and his mandate against child violence.\n\nOnce the show adds Rudy's otherworldly and informed values into the mix to foil Ruijerd's, philosophical debates, tough choices spring up. While never totally in favor of either Rujierd's or Rudy's methods, the show fully explores both, crafting a few poignant scenes exploring the nature of violence and justification of power. These situations unsettle and upset the characters, forcing them to talk out their decisions as equals, and the friction generates wonderful character growth and drama.\n\nThat is not to say it is all smooth storytelling with Ruijerd. The plot dump detailing his past is not particularly great storytelling, and at times his moral code feels like an excuse for him to use violence without having the audience lose sympathy because of it. Still, he plays an integral role in Dead End's dynamics with a relatable goal, respectable passions, and understandable weaknesses that complement Eris and Rudy. Rujierd walks the path toward an ending of redemption and social acceptance after learning how to from the children. Because it is easy to root for Ruijerd and fun to watch him struggle to find his way in the world, he places third.",

Ton gets great characterization and demonstrates his love for his family as he swallows his pride in the face of troubles at work. The character development of Kabae, Anai, and Fenneko in previous seasons is respected, and it never feels like they're reset to how they were at the beginning of the series.\n\nThis season delves more into Haida's troubled relationship with Retsuko. Unfortunately, the excuses he comes up with border on unbelievable at times, and it diminishes his impact as a character. This season sells itself as one that could resolve the questions about their relationship, but instead shows a different side of Haida. He starts to crave the attention and validation that he never got under Ton, but now does under the new CEO Himuro. This side plot destabilizes what should be easy character development for Haida.\n\nStill, *Aggretsuko*'s large, diverse cast makes for a great workplace comedy, and continues to make its characters some of the most intriguing to follow. Whether it's Kabae's gossip, Ton's bullheadedness, or Retsuko's evolving romantic relationships, it's easy to find someone to empathize with in *Aggretsuko*.",

          "writeup": "With the group's death drama now largely buried in season one, *Zombieland Saga: Revenge* instead leverages Fanchouchou's personal ambitions for fresh character arcs. Everyone, even previously marginalized characters and new episodic foils, have vivid and tangible stories that hit harder than a runaway truck; well-timed, funny and emotional.\n\nAt the heart of this show is a tale of misfits, failures, and cast-offs finding purpose and acceptance in undeath for a world that never really gave them a chance to flourish in life. The joke of monsters being idols and shambling through the day may have rotted a bit, but in its place, *Revenge* showed us far more high-minded and intriguing concerns: identity, desire, belonging, and living—truly living—for more than just oneself.\n\nFor a character-based show, the group dynamic doesn't feature heavily this season. The drama exists mostly as zombie vs. society and zombie vs. zombie self. Leaving the tight found-family untouched helps the show's strict episodic aims, but the absence of awesome moments of tension or rap battles between members leaves a rap battle-sized void in this season, only partially filled by Tae's Freddy Mercury impression.\n\nStill, *Zombieland Saga: Revenge* stands out as a paragon of episodic character writing and engaging ensemble casts. Franchouchou's failures, triumphs, and realizations arise directly from their own actions, and it is only by the strength of their bonds that these girls carve out a place in a society that truly accepts them for who they are and who they want to be.",

Elma in particular is now a much stronger character with a compelling, lore-relevant backstory that expands on her relationship with Tooru.

There's plenty of room for the expansive supporting cast to shine with Kanna and Shouta even having full episodes to themselves, although Riko remains one-note.\nThe cast's newest addition Ilulu is the latest dragon to crash-land in Kobayashi's life, and her reliance on sexual humor is bound to be hit-or-miss with audiences. However, her backstory is emotionally engaging and fits well with the show's overall themes surrounding the co-existence of dragons and humans. \nThe sequel to *Kobayashi-san Chi no Maidragon* maintains its cast's colorful energy while developing them as well earning the fourth place spot.",

From the main grouping of romantic interests all the way to near throwaway characters, everyone receives the proper amount of focus to complete their stories neatly. However, just tying up loose ends is not what garnered the adoration of audiences. The emotional connection to the cast, weight of their story conclusions, and entertaining characters surpassed all of its competition. Akito's development stole the spotlight, completing an arc rivaled by few in the romance genre. Their story managed to both delight and disturb viewers with its twists and reveals. Kyo's series-spanning story also reached its climactic boiling point alongside his reconciliation with the rest of the cast, specifically the other Zodiac Members. The overarching narrative of character's hiding their true selves behind a mask is portrayed beautifully as well, with the theme of those masks being shed given a bright spotlight.\n\n*Fruits Basket*'s unparalleled character writing made it a clear choice for first place as the best cast of the year.

This approach gives a unique edge to the show by elevating peculiar characters such as Emilia, Roswaal and Beatrice more engagingly.\n\nEmilia stands at the center of this season as we explore her past alongside her. By watching the difficulties she encountered, viewers gain newfound insight into her current personality that's sorely needed. This type of approach comes with a cost however. Since the series spends most of its screen time on past events that mostly concern Emilia, the present story slows to a halt with less developed characters like Garfiel.\n\nOne of the potential problems with this retrospective approach is that newly introduced characters have less time to shine. This might result in weaker characters but *Re:Zero* manages to flesh out and humanize them with empathic character writing. As a result, these characters hook audiences in and create an immersive experience.\n\nOverall, *Re:Zero*'s cast shines once again by using a different approach to storytelling and switching between past and current timelines. However, some major players were left in the dark, resulting in weaker character resolutions. For that reason, *Re:Zero* lands in sixth place on the list.",

Maki and Nanami were notable highlights for the way in which their involvement in the world of Jujutsu Sorcerers comes about. Other characters such as Gojou or Mahito stand out for being incredibly charismatic to suit their dominating displays of power, but have little in the way of substance to support their individual motivations. The character dynamics between Yuuji, Megumi, and Nobara were reminiscent of the classic interactions between members of Naruto's Team Seven.

Furthermore, almost none of the other side characters have any meaningful interactions with each other beyond shallow surface-level conversations and cooperation. In terms of antagonists, *Mushoku Tensei* runs on a standard “conflict of the week” formula, only hinting at a possible overarching antagonist. These characters are not particularly memorable, and lack chemistry. Rudy is generally the only person with whom cast members have meaningful interactions, as everything is through his lens. Aside from Roxy, characters rarely have substantial development in any situation that is not directly connected to Rudy.\n\n*Mushoku Tensei* ultimately lands in seventh place, not due to lacking well-written characters, but instead lacking a wide enough cast with substantial synergy and particularly memorable antagonists.",

Episode nine's [duel by Kouki Fujimoto](https://www.sakugabooru.com/post/show/171253) is a brilliant action set piece, which unfortunately turns into a rarity within the show; Genpei War's huge armies turn into daunting foes for the show's production, as static shots and stiff motions become awkwardly common midst the action climaxes.\n\n\nThe effects, especially with water and fire, are memorable assets that mesh well together with the show's unique aesthetic and create immersive [atmospheres](https://www.sakugabooru.com/post/show/171374) on [numerous](https://www.sakugabooru.com/post/show/172173) [occasions](https://www.sakugabooru.com/post/show/165155). Thanks to moments like [episode six's epiphanic nightmare](https://www.sakugabooru.com/post/show/168721), the animation finds its means to elevate the experience in the show's middle stretch, where even the strong character acting's metaphorical butter gets spread too thin. Lacking in volume but not in diversity, *Heike Monogatari*'s animation earns its placement as seventh.",

[Character animation](https://www.sakugabooru.com/post/show/165919) is [fun](https://www.sakugabooru.com/post/show/163933) and [varied](https://www.sakugabooru.com/post/show/162602) throughout the runtime of the show. Routine actions like running, talking, and gesticulating are animated carefully to give very genuine, nuanced motion. A handful of characters are very muted and unemotive, which leverages the lively animation less than it otherwise could, but otherwise *Sonny Boy* effectively and realistically brings its cast to life.\n\n\nPerhaps more impressively, the liveliness of the animation doesn't end at the human characters – there is extensive and impressive animal animation as well. Birds - a recurring motif in the series - feature [motions](https://www.sakugabooru.com/post/show/160282) that are both true-to-life and clearly indicative of their purpose. Recurring characters include a [trio of cats](https://www.sakugabooru.com/post/show/165905), complete with unique mannerisms but overall grounded movement – and a [human-turned-dog](https://www.sakugabooru.com/post/show/162667) animated with an unnerving mix of dog movements and human mannerisms. There is also an [incredible cut](https://www.sakugabooru.com/post/show/162074) of an entire school of fish as the characters swim through the ocean.\n\n\nOn the other hand, it has a relative dearth of truly memorable moments and highlight cuts compared to the first and second-place entries. There aren't none, of course – there is some truly impressive effects work to convey the [special powers](https://www.sakugabooru.com/post/show/163926) at the core of the story, but the aforementioned realism means much more emphasis is placed on the mundane than the exceptional.\n\n\nAt the end of the day, though, it's this focus on the mundane that gives a permeating realism to the story, which is certainly impressive in its own right. The consistency of the work is truly laudable, and the baseline of the show is very high and offers few gaffes to undermine its goals. This consistency is especially laudable considering it did not have a traditional chief animation director.",

Its [nuanced acting is led by renowned character animator, Keisuke Kobayashi](https://www.sakugabooru.com/post/show/144885) along with a star-studded staff of guest animators who are able to perfectly convey the personalities of its entire cast, [from Rika's gregarious nature to Neiru's subdued one](https://www.sakugabooru.com/post/show/145637). This specificity in mannerism, further helps the show in making standout statements where it breaks form as in [eel's depiction of Ai's cathartic declaration](https://www.sakugabooru.com/post/show/145665).

[Ryo Miyagi's flames](https://www.sakugabooru.com/post/show/159088) exhibit strong shape, volume, and coloring; demonstrating the ferocity of Tohru's and Ilulu's clash.

The bold, action flick-y camera movement and clear close combat choreography effectively sell the fights' intensity as well as gained traction on the subreddit.  \n\n\nUnfortunately, *Vivy* doesn't offer much else to be impressed about, paling in comparison to other nominees in other aspects. The character acting is very sparse due to Vivy's muted personality while her energetic partner Matsumoto being mostly relegated to a cube form causes limitations.\n\n\nWhile CGI scenes offer diversity to the show's action, the execution often leaves much to be desired with its generic digital effects and lack of cohesion such as the CG usage in a climactic battle in episode 6. The 2D fight scenes stand out, but they are not without fault either: Tokumaru's sequence in episode 4 is a good example of the show's occasional jerky movements and bold layouts causing awkward results. The frantically moving background glides underneath the characters' feet and makes the setting's depth feel very hard to define. This causes in-depth motions and sense of each movements' speed to feel unclear and clumsy.\n\n\nAs the fights mostly stick to traditional, acrobatic martial arts action and the show lacks noteworthy dance sequences, the potential of a show about a fighting robot idol doesn't feel fully realized.

Another factor was that scenes outside of action scenes mostly consist of wide shots of characters on opposite sides of the frame, close ups with only their mouths moving, or just a simple walk cycle.

Increasingly, even digital pipelines have tried to mimic analog aesthetics, be it the cel illustrations in *SSSS.Dynazenon* or the crayon style of *Kobayashi-san Chi no Maidragon S*. The jury’s final four nominees chosen from a large field of deserving candidates are good representatives of both these trends in anime. *Mars Red* and *Vlad Love* in particular stand out as some of the most interesting usage of digital background art to recreate painterly or graphical aesthetics in recent memory.  \n \nWhile the public nominated two jury shortlists in *Mushoku Tensei: Isekai Ittara Honki Dasu* and *Yuru Camp△ Season 2*, the jury also had to go a period of intense catchup as nobody in the category expected *Jujutsu Kaisen* to be a nominee in Background Art. Following that our final ranking discussion focused on the cohesiveness of the chosen artstyle for every nominee - both interior and exterior scenes; their diversity in locales and stylizations to avoid the buildup of fatigue from overexposure; and perhaps most importantly the ability of the background art to visually inform the viewer about the narrative goals of the work as well as the personality and culture of the characters via the world they inhabit. Under these criteria we came to a unanimous ranking for our top two and bottom three picks, with only the order of the middle pack of *Mars Red*, *Vlad Love*, and *Mushoku Tensei* being contentious.",

Even the show's standard backgrounds are worthy of praise, with the faux [watercolor-esque style](https://i.imgur.com/VfPetOa.png) enhancing the often dark and moody atmosphere. *Vlad Love*'s biggest triumphs are the episodes presented solely via background art and narration without sacrificing expressiveness or detail. They take form in many different styles, from [detailed illustrations](https://i.imgur.com/EqyI9fy.png) to [abstract representations of emotion](https://i.imgur.com/crEIsoH.png) perfectly conveying the mood. \n\n\n\nDespite its strengths, *Vlad Love* lacks the consistency required to reach the level of the top nominees. The show overuses blue-green and yellow-orange palettes in its standard backgrounds, and its foliage can clash with visual filters. Otherwise, *Vlad Love*'s foray into visual experimentation is fitting for its subject matter. The vampire Mai takes on the characteristics of things she consumes, and similarly, the background art takes on different aesthetics to match the episode's content. The most striking is episode nine's homage to classic manga artist Yoshiharu Tsuge as it takes on the deep red colors and dystopian imagery that typify his work to create the most surrealist episode of the year. *Vlad Love*'s experimental and boundary pushing background art make it deserving of its fourth place ranking.",

Utilizing bold brush strokes and lighting to convey rich texture, it achieves a level of opulence with its high focus on composition and impressionistic realism. \n\n\n\nWhile its strengths are not to be understated, *Mars Red* does notably falter in its consistency. The cinematic filters and effects used makes the scenes look foggy and almost sterile. And although the 3D models and elements add depth, they also look out-of-place, hurting the cohesion and strong composition.\n\n\n\n*Mars Red*, however, sports the best interior designs of its contemporaries, effortlessly achieving a balance between commodiousness and intricacy, rich with personality. Another showcase of its brilliant sense of light, the interiors make use of negative space and architecture similar to the time period it mimics to build a beautiful and effective composition.\n\n\n\nIts production blunders don't hold it back in the slightest though. *Mars Red* is a very strong show both technically and aesthetically. Its phenomenal interiors, rich brush stroke techniques, and it's theaterly aesthetic no doubt help push *Mars Red* backgrounds to an exemplary third place.",

          "writeup": "The art in *Heike Monogatari* is a fusion between modern background art and classical Japanese painting. The gentle and delicate linework of the background art beautifully captures the essence of the Heian Period.\n\n\n\n*Heike Monogatari*'s strongest feature is its thematic approach to landscapes. The show offers diverse backgrounds capturing the change in seasonality; this is marked by the changing fauna depicted in stunning detail and is one of the major strengths of the show. It uses rich soft pastel colors to create a spirited atmosphere befitting for this picturesque period piece. While the show is compositionally flat, it's not necessarily a bad thing given its aim to recreate the painting style of the Heian period. The vivid bright red for sunsets and dark gray to capture the scenes of war cleverly differentiate these scenes from the usual soft color palette, emphasizing some of the most emotionally impactful scenes in the show. The biggest weakness of *Heike* comes from the setting itself as the period appropriate largely empty interiors with the same pastel brown walls and floors grew tiring after a while. Still, this is a minor fault considering the show's other triumphs.\n\n\n\nThe show shifts its minimalistic artstyle to a more watercolor aesthetic Kamakura period art style near the epilogue showcasing the naturalistic deviation from the Heian art and signifying the beginning of a new era. All in all, *Heike* is a masterfully crafted period piece and a near perfect depiction of the Heian art style, easily leaving its mark on the jury and as such is deserving of being the runner-up of this year.",

When this potential is taken advantage of, the results are effective—adding character and detail to the show's world while maintaining strong aesthetic sensibilities. The AI Island, [\"Metal Float\"](https://i.imgur.com/Bez0RFC.jpg) is the show's crowning jewel with regards to background art and setting design. It's a fun concept with a strong visual contrast from the rest of the show. The metallic tendrils and irregular shape give credence to the show's idea of the island itself growing and evolving.\n\n\n\nOtherwise, the show's world is a barebones futuristic science fiction setting. Architecture is the usual vaguely sleek neon-tinged skyscrapers with little variation and personality. The Archive is a visual experiment that misses the mark, with coloring that is more garish than appealing. This is a pressing issue as a significant portion of the show's last arc takes place with the Archive as the backdrop. This lack of variety in setting is a consistent problem throughout the show.\n\n\n\nHowever, the backgrounds aren't without strengths. Interiors are often solid, with strong texturing throughout. [Wood textures](https://i.imgur.com/1g2JlJD.png) in particular are appealing and offer a needed contrast to the abundance of bland sci-fi material.

          "writeup": "*Jujutsu Kaisen* mainly takes place in the seedy underbelly of a Tokyo haunted with curses. This setting poses a difficult job for the show's debut art director Jeong Ryeon Kim and his army of outsourced background artists as they have to show off the grungy nature of the world and still make the show appealing to look at. The show sometimes succeeds at this task, notably in episodes directed by Ryohei Takeshita, where it is able to make attractive displays out of its grim environments. For example, [the alleyway where Junpei first encounters Mahito](https://i.imgur.com/nckWAMl.jpeg) depicts the squalid condition of the area while capturing the bewitching presence of a special curse. Sadly, beyond those episodes it is plagued with overtly gritty texturing and a gross purple-tinged gradient which makes the show's art highly unappealing.\n\n\n\nThe show also has fairly limited settings, with the second cour largely set in a forest beset with garishly bright-green foliage. This limitation is counteracted by the biggest highlight and source of variance in the show's art direction: its Domain Expansion scenes. These can transform an otherwise unremarkable setting into a parade of abstract backgrounds that at [their best](https://i.imgur.com/tXKqamK.jpeg) stunningly convey [the power of a Jujutsu user](https://i.imgur.com/EKAvnJd.jpeg).

This decision makes for a wonderful showcase of Japan's natural beauty.\n\n\n\nHowever, this attempt at creating lifelike backgrounds leads to a number of problems with compositing.

It utilizes excessive desaturation in an attempt to match the season, but this also creates an uninteresting color palette. This dour palette is further exacerbated by the limited foliage in winter, and ultimately results in the show's backgrounds lacking variety.\n\n\n\nThe final section of the show is stronger in both its variety of locales and consistency. The trip to Izu shows off a number of topologically interesting and beautiful geospot locations where the show is finally able to fully show off the strength of its photorealistic backgrounds.\n\n\n\nIn the end, while *Yuru Camp△ Season 2*'s backgrounds are a sight to behold when they work, they are held back by their inconsistency.",

The first cour is a generic fantasy world setting with poorly integrated elements, such as the CG house and [wheat fields](https://i.imgur.com/ovXH8Sn.jpeg) in Rudy's hometown. It provides some variety by ending in the Demon Continent, but while that is topographically interesting, it has a color palette of [ugly yellows and browns with very unappealing gradients](https://i.imgur.com/cwZGEA7.jpeg) that ultimately makes the setting a negative. There are also many scenes in which the backgrounds are just plain hazy or blurred because of the show's usage of a heavy grain filter. The end result muddies the foreground and background and makes the scenes visually unclear.\n\n\n\nIn spite of these issues, the background art team does a great job in making the isekai world a real, living place by introducing highly detailed landscapes with culturally varied settings.

While the jury looked at over two dozen shortlists, the shortlists chiefly fell into four different camps: the minimalist realism of *Sonny Boy* and *Heike Monogatari*; the vibrant moekko designs of *Wonder Egg Priority* and *Selection Project*; the joseimuke-catering designs of *Sk∞* and *Vanitas*; and the tokusatsu homages and diverse casts of *SSSS.Dynazenon* and *Godzilla S.P*. All of them had their own unique pros and cons and the jury had the unenviable task of picking four of them to fill our limited slots, especially given the lack of overlap with the public nominees besides *Jujutsu Kaisen*. After much discussion, we landed on our current four nominees. \n \nIt is important to specify that the discussion to whittle down the nominees focused on multiple criteria. The most important of these were: animation friendliness and expressivity; suitability of the designs for a character’s personality and their ability to inform the narrative; and aesthetic qualities like coloring, diversity of shapes, and lineart. The jury used these same criteria to finalize our ranking, where many placements became immediately obvious. The winner, though, was a battle down to the wire between *Sonny Boy* and *Dynazenon* as both shows not only excelled in creating attractive designs but also got an insane amount of narrative mileage from them.",

          "writeup": "Norifumi Kugai's adaptation of [Hisashi Eguchi's original character designs for *Sonny Boy*](https://i.imgur.com/sCQwzam.jpg) captures his most essential qualities as a pop art illustrator: a combination of pristine line art, high-contrast one-tone colors, minimal amount of shadows and line work to provide depth and illustrate fabric folds, and, perhaps most importantly, a heavy de-emphasis on big *moe* eyes in favor of a facsimile of Japanese eyes with epicanthic folds that remain realistic yet graphically attractive. The last factor also serves as a useful way to create understated ethnic diversity with Rajdhani's eyes being far wider than the rest of the crew. While realism is a strength of the designs, their minimalist traits are also effectively applied for the surreal characters in the show's later half, particularly, [War, who casts a striking figure with just three base colors](https://i.imgur.com/DYR6B31.jpeg).\n\nBeyond their aesthetic prowess, these designs also do a great job at conveying the personality of the characters and their role in the narrative. Nozomi's distinct blue uniform informs the viewer about both her status as a transfer student and a catalyst in the plot as well as her vivacious and transparent nature. During episode 2's election backstory, Mizuho's free-flowing hair and unkempt uniform contrasted with Pony's tightly-bound ponytail and prim attire to provide a delightful amount of dramatic irony. This ability to capture the narrative minutiae, combined with its unique aesthetics, gave *Sonny Boy*'s designs the edge needed to win this category.",

          "writeup": "A natural evolution from his work on *SSSS.GRIDMAN*, Masaru Sakamoto's designs for *SSSS.DYNAZENON* balance eye-catching elements with subtle details beautifully. Vibrant colors and angular linework create an abundance of vivid imagery throughout the show, and an emphasis on flexibility gives the designs an [energetic distortion](https://i.imgur.com/5Bwm62T.png) during intense animation. Eyes are a distinct highlight– their prominent colors act as a [point of contrast against the designs' cohesive palettes](https://i.imgur.com/tkF7RWF.png). The designs achieve these visual strengths without compromising their ability to hint towards characters' innerworkings through details such as Gauma's bandages or Chise's arm wrap.\n\n*SSSS.DYNAZENON* excels in its breadth. The Kaiju Eugenicists' military uniforms are a clear divergence from the main cast, but the villains aren't without charming customizations that convey their unique personalities. Even minor characters such as Yomogi's boss or Yume's friend have bright colorwork and careful details that allow for a seamless fit with the expressive main cast.\n\nIt would be remiss to forgo praising the titular Dynazenon mecha and its Kaiju enemies. Dynazenon's inclusion of each individual component in the final design is a strong visualization of the group's teamwork, and the mech's ability to flow between 3D and 2D animation leads to stunning animation. The Kaiju continue to carry over the “man-in-suit” aesthetic from the series' tokusatsu roots, cementing the show's visual language. *SSSS.DYNAZENON*'s striking color and linework decisions, and impressive care for all aspects of design made it a strong runner up.",

The show's vibrant colorscape extends to its characters, making them pop off the screen against an already vivid background.  The designs are great at reflecting the personalities of the various skaters while also allowing for smooth animation.  The outfit design stands out in particular. Adam's flamboyant costume garnered worthy praise for reflecting his theatrical and often over-the-top personality.  While such grand costume designs were noteworthy, the everyday outfits are also strong in their ability to reflect the character's personalities. Reki's design in particular embodies the best elements of the show's design. Individual elements such as a hoodie under a school uniform or a headband have been used in anime, but the way Reki wears them makes the design aesthetically pleasing and unmistakably unique, all while allowing for ease of animation.  The show further imbued personality into the designs through the skateboard design, which were all incredibly unique and doubled as a fantastic worldbuilding tool.\n\nWhile the main cast sported stellar designs, some felt the side cast felt comparatively lackluster.  Some character designs such as Kiriko, Tadashi, and the skate shop owner didn't quite match the strength of other designs in the show. Some felt that some of the production falling off as the show went on deserved to be a bit of a negative when evaluating the overall success of the design work.  Overall, *SK∞* is a worthy nomination, but ultimately wasn't consistent enough to compete for a top spot.",

For example, the AI characters have slightly off-color skin tones and eyeball cameras. The most obvious showcase of this difference is during the stunning hyper-detailed shots that highlight the uncanniness of the AI's designs.\n\nThe titular character, Vivy, is the highlight of the show's character design, particularly in her strong color design with her striking blue hair. Her design perfectly encapsulates the virtual idol aesthetic that the show is trying to achieve. The rest of her sisters match this same aesthetic well, but often feel significantly less inspired than Vivy. The designs for the human characters are similarly uninteresting with nothing that makes their designs stand out.\n\nThe show does have some strong designs outside of Vivy though, namely the AI bots during the Metal Float arc and Matsumoto's two forms. His teddy bear form works well as a mascot character for the show, complimenting Vivy's hair with his own blue color. His cube form, meanwhile, allows for some fun combinations to occur during fights, despite generally subpar CGI.\n\nDespite many designs lacking depth, those that do standout lead *Vivy: Fluorite Eye's Song* to an eighth place finish.",

The over-the-top designs of the monsters help create a fantastic mix of both intimidating horror and goofiness, with their exaggerated proportions and their colorful bodies. Each monster's unique design ties-in into the narrative smoothly, which makes their ridiculousness fit in with the show. It also uses a more simplistic, yet effective approach for some of them. The Wonder Killer, for example, is a high-school girl with a censored face and bizarre lips that makes her look odd and unsettling. \n\nThere were also some monster designs that were a bit underwhelming, especially the last one near the end of the show, which is basically just a glorified flying head. The main characters' outfits are memorable, without being too unrealistic or over the top. The existence of Ai's heterochromia, however, is poorly made, since it's whole purpose is to give a reason for her to be bullied. That being said, the designs for the characters and monsters were well-executed and the production team clearly put a lot of time and effort  into perfecting them. \n\n*Wonder Egg Priority* definitely has memorable and unique designs and deserved its nomination, even if it didn't get any higher in the rankings.",

The middle episodes are noticeably weaker, making extensive use of panning and featuring less creative presentation. The numerous battles of the narrative have been publicly noted as a reason the classic hasn't been adapted, and *Heike Monogatari* certainly justifies that concern, as the battles are often messily directed and overuse stills to poorly depict a dynamic and crucial part of the story. \n\n\nFrom a directorial standpoint, there's a lot to love. Although some of the techniques that mimic modern live-action techniques (such as [lens flares](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/897599670019301407/935352018527203358/unknown.png) and [chromatic aberration](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/897599670019301407/935372795548942367/unknown.png)) often fall flat, the use of [rack focus](https://www.sakugabooru.com/post/show/166410) aids in directing attention in the show's highly detailed world. Editing [seamlessly connects](https://www.sakugabooru.com/post/show/171373) disparate scenes that tie different places or characters together, often in concert with the aforementioned flower symbolism to tastefully but unambiguously convey characters' demises. Framing in *Heike Monogatari* is also excellent: for example, Biwa is often placed at the edge of scenes to reinforce her nature as an outsider, and [Dutch angles](https://www.sakugabooru.com/post/show/170686) are frequently used as the Heike's situation gets progressively desperate to mirror their anxieties and pain.\n",

Some of the best camera and effects work of the year can be found in the show's wide range of displays.  The dragon battles were a notable highlight, with [Illulu and Tohru's](https://www.sakugabooru.com/post/show/159087) battle as well as the many battles between [Tohru and Elma](https://www.sakugabooru.com/post/show/163857) bringing a level of cinematography not found in most action shows.  Even outside of obvious action moments, mundane moments such as [cooking](https://www.sakugabooru.com/post/show/159001) or even [playing soccer with a shoe](https://www.sakugabooru.com/post/show/162510) dial up the visual presentation to eleven. .  While strong effects work makes for an enjoyable watch, other facets of the show deserve equal praise. In particular, the bright color palette is not only aesthetically pleasing, but a perfect fit for the show, and really brings out the best of the myriad of environments explored in this season.\n\nAll that said, the overall reception for the show's cinematography was mixed.  Many felt that while *Maid Dragon* was always proficient, it was rarely spectacular, which made it tough to compete with the upper echelon of the category.  While the show's boarding does improve with stellar episodes in the back half of the season, the first half of the season had storyboarding that would most accurately be described as mediocre.  While there were some instances of stellar lighting choices, particularly involving “golden hour” lighting and fireworks shots, there were also many moments of dull lighting.  Ultimately, the show's strengths were enough to put it in the top half of the category.",

          "writeup": "Over the course of its run, *Sonny Boy* covers a broad range of tones - mysterious, dramatic, chaotic, personal - all requiring careful cinematographic execution to be depicted effectively. *Sonny Boy* deftly delivers this through the use of intricate framing, clean compositing, and lighting. Its strengths lie in the variance of its presentation, largely depending on the ever-changing settings that still manage to remain cohesive.\n\nThe cast is a significant focus of the story, made evident through intricate perspectives and framing of characters. Visual motifs are used often, such as focusing on Nozomi's eyes or Hoshi's star mark during key moments in the script. These creative decisions add thematic value to the narrative overall by visually introducing more weight to scenes. For example, episode eight highlights the [distance Yamahiko feels between himself and the rest of the students](https://i.imgur.com/Os97MUz.png) through both the framing as well as the coloring of the students - which works in parallel with [Nagara and his viewpoint through the](https://i.imgur.com/Bi7Y46t.png) [first half of the series.](https://i.imgur.com/5jEI8uV.png) The creative decisions also help preserve the slower but thoughtful pacing the show holds, allowing for the swift and lively visual bursts to be even more impactful.\n\nWhile *Sonny Boy* is largely driven by director Shingo Natsume's own vision; having been given the rare gift of a blank slate to create something special with, the various episode directors instilled their own visual flair for their respective parts. Episode eight stands out especially in this regard, with Keiichiro Saito's [excellent storyboarding](https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/f1860154219c2fb9973f095212973d85.mp4) elevating the impact of what was a [very personal and melancholic backstory](https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/ecd343f7e72d2e6ebd9cf3e14580b361.mp4).

The storyboarding was unremarkable outside of a few select scenes, particularly the classy action scenes of episode nine and moments such as Vivy chasing Matsumoto in episode one. Other key moments, however, including the flying in episode six, suffered from weak use of CGI and poorly composited visual effects, while the beautiful choreography in the fight between Vivy and Elizabeth is let down by the shoddily-inserted backgrounds.

          "writeup": "Like many similar shows, the main draw for *Jujutsu Kaisen*'s cinematography is its action scenes. The fights are breathtaking with impressive choreography and dynamic camerawork. However, the show gets overambitious at times. The 3D backgrounds practically required for fights of this level feature awful texturing and there are a number of continuity errors in some fights.\n\nAction scenes aren't the only thing in which *Jujutsu Kaisen* excels. The cinematic aspect ratio and shift in aesthetic during the fake backstory between Itadori and Toudou are great, and the baseball scene in episode 21 shows that *Jujutsu Kaisen* can also have some great comedic cinematography.\n\nOutside of these positives, *Jujutsu Kaisen* doesn't have much to offer. The framing, shot selection and editing are too standard for the most part. The color palette is also uninteresting, consisting mostly of dull grays or garish greens depending on the setting.\n\nThe supernatural elements of the show do add some interest from this perspective, however. The visual effects and color utilization of blues and reds for cursed energy creates striking contrast between the rest of the color palette. The domains are generally strong, particularly Gojou's with its ethereal feel.  In the rare times when the show does shift from its usual aesthetic, it leads to some spectacular highs.   \n\nDespite *Jujutsu Kaisen*'s strengths, the amount of mediocre moments leads to its seventh place finish.",

          "writeup": "All of *86*'s excellence in storyboarding stems from the remarkably powerful decision to separate each episode of the show into two wholly distinct chunks: one with Lena's time at San Magnolia and the other with Spearhead Squadron's at the frontline. The boarding follows through on this inherent dichotomy by heightening the contrast between scenes with its signature abrupt transitions that emphasize the thematics between the desperation of the soldiers and the hedonism of the ruling class. \n\nResolving these symbolic dichotomies gives the show's narrative propulsion that wouldn't exist without the deliberate direction. Perhaps the best example of this is Lena's arc. She starts out by trying to understand the squad from a position of naive charity captured with a bold uninterrupted shot that doesn't let the audience leave her headspace. This facile connection quickly blows up in her face and gives way to the development of genuine camaraderie via shared pain that the show reinforces by [mirroring her](https://i.imgur.com/dplMGKw.jpeg) and [Shin's framing](https://i.imgur.com/oJknD3k.jpeg) in key moments. Another highlight is Episode ten's flashback montage through Fido's lens that effectively sums up the squad's journey.\n\nThe action scenes are not as engagingly boarded as the rest of the show, with rare exceptions like the fight between Shin and Sho. They are also hampered by the usage of stock visual effects which creates for a dull spectacle. However, this is a minor setback for a show that otherwise excels in evocatively communicating its intent and thoroughly deserves its favorable fifth ranking.",

This is the main strength of the show's cinematography – it creates a distinct look by implementing a muted color palette, adding grain filters and simple camera tricks.

Deftly switching from wide to perspective shots maintains clarity and showcases the strengths of individual fighters.. The series also features dynamic camerawork, namely in episodes five, 21, and during the dance in Episode seven.\nAll this said,  the show's predominant usage of brown, green and gray hues makes many of its locations blend together and leaves little lasting impression. Outside of climatic episodes, the framing, editing and shot composition are standard, and the effect work is inconsistent, especially regarding fire or the filters in the Hitogami room.\nDespite the amazing highlights of several episodes, the rest of the show pales in comparison and ultimately places *Mushoku Tensei* in a respectable sixth place.",

The Victorian inspiration is immediately recognizable from a first listen, with additional layers and bits of flare added in to create a fresh but recognizable soundscape. Violin and cello solos add some extra spice to many themes, with surprise accordion appearances and Suehiro's exceptional keys leading the tracks along.\n\n\nUtilization was an integral part to *Shadows House's* success; the tracklist is filled with various mood- and tone-setting pieces that are used wonderfully to complement the show. Be it the mystery vibes, slice-of-life moments, or even very intense sequences, each moment had a unique track that elevated the experience. The mixing is also of note, never overpowering scenes but also allowing space for the sound effects and voice acting to hold their own.\n\n\nThe combination of all these factors is what led to *Shadows House* taking the second placement among the jury rankings and being a standout soundtrack for the year.",

Ultimately though, the positives outweigh the negatives, and it is worthy of the recognition it deserves as one of the best anime OSTs in recent memory.",

          "writeup": "Among all the anime that aired this year, a single entry shone through as the jury's clear favorite. With advice from the legendary Shinichirou Watanabe, director Natsume Shingo invited onboard an assortment of contemporary musicians to create a soundtrack brimming with both variety and personality. The range of the soundtrack is truly remarkable, with tracks varying from experimental mood pieces like “Yamabiko's/Kodama's Theme,” to beautiful insert songs like “Let There Be Light Again” and “Lightship.” Despite the tracks being composed by different artists, *Sonny Boy* is able to ensure that the different musical styles never feel dissonant with each other.\n\n\nWhile watching *Sonny Boy*, the most notable thing about the soundtrack might very well be its extremely sparse usage, with the entire first episode not featuring even a single track. This restraint when it comes to background music allows *Sonny Boy* to save it for maximum emotional impact. Already in episode two, we bear witness to a wonderful build-up of synths in “Seagull,” effortlessly encapsulating the episode in question. In episode six, the midseason finale, we're treated to the first of many insert songs, “Let There Be Light Again,” providing us with one of the most powerful usages of music this year as the cast attempt to return back to their world. Yamabiko's backstory in episode 8, in many ways the show's most experimental episode, fully delivers musically with equally experimental episode-spanning tracks which capture the unusual mood of the episode, while the finale of the show sends us off with a math-rock rhapsody.\n\n\n*Sonny Boy* rises above its competition through its sheer ambition — ambition which in this case is coupled with close to flawless execution— and thus takes home first place in the category.",

          "writeup": "The second nomination for Hiroyuki Sawano and Kohta Yamamoto, *86: Eighty Six* debuted with a wild OST befitting the intensity of the first season. *86*'s OST shows off a variety of influences and uses tracks that effectively support the scenes. \n\n\nThe best moments of this OST came during the battle scenes, and most of the variety on this OST comes from the fights. Sawano shows off modern influences to create futuristic war themes. “The Answer” in particular represents the style in this OST, with wailing guitars and a touch of 90's R&B. The song choices work coherently with each scene, but even these strong tracks are severely hampered by overwhelming sound effects.\n\n\nWhen the action stops, the OST slows things down and tackles the emotions at the core of *86*. These tracks are somber and focus on traditional instruments, dropping the electric guitar in favor of violin and piano, connecting the soundtrack to the internal struggles of the cast (Lena in particular). These tracks were not as memorable as anything that plays while sparks are flying, but they bring balance to the OST as a whole. \n\n\n*86*'s OST cements itself as a competent action album and has quite a few memorable themes. It was ultimately held back by some severe mixing issues and a general lack of variety but still more than earned it's nomination.",

          "writeup": "It should come as no surprise that a series about an idol android attempting to save the world would pay particular attention to its OST. *Vivy: Fluorite Eye's Song* relies mostly on electronic-backed tracks to set its futuristic cyber-dystopian atmosphere, and it generally does so quite effectively. The diversity in these electronic tracks is one of the OST's greatest strengths, as it prevented it from becoming stale or too one-note. The track “Matsumoto, the Stuffed Bear,” for example, sees chiptune elements joined by an accordion in order to effectively convey Matsumoto's quirkiness, while these elements aren't used in other parts of the OST where they wouldn't make as much sense. \n\n\nThe addition of typical orchestral string arrangements to some of the tracks was the most significant point of criticism, as they feel unnecessarily shoehorned in. Instead of adding to the scenes they were used in, the tracks featuring these string arrangements instead feel a bit dissonant from the rest of the OST. \n\n\nThe insert songs are the main standout of the series, as they effectively convey both the intensity and nuance of the scenes they were used in and allows those scenes to shine. A notable example of this is “Fluorite Eye's Song,” used in episode 13. As the culmination of Vivy's personal journey to both save the world and sing powerfully, the insert itself wraps up several of the show's thematic arcs. Overall, the high points of the OST earned it a fifth-place finish.",

In a competitive year, the soundtrack effectively utilized its individual compositions, and did an excellent job at enhancing not only key moments with its fantastical sounds of wonder, but also providing subtler moments with appropriate music.\n\n\nDespite the positives, the soundtrack garnered some criticism. A common criticism was that the tracks were reused often, leading to inconsistency in the show's usage of its music. Additionally the lack of variety in the instrumentation was a negative, with an overreliance on flutes and other generically medieval instruments being especially noteworthy, which leads to the soundtrack failing to distinguish itself from other fantasy isekai. Despite this, the soundtrack was praised for how it managed to change its sound depending on what location the cast was visiting, for example with the tribal-style music played in the beastman village. In addition, the show's utilization of its opening sequences for establishing the episode was also a positive.\n\n\nOverall the *Mushoku Tensei* soundtrack was competently used and well composed, but lacked an x-factor to allow it to reach the heights or consistency of its competitors more than occasionally, which is what keeps it eighth in the rankings.",

          "writeup": "The *Shingeki no Kyojin: Final Season* OST says, “If it ain't broke, don't fix it.” Hiroyuki Sawano returns to deliver more of the intense orchestral pieces that have defined the series. Joining this season, composer Kohta Yamamoto brings somber tracks to give greater weight to the emotional moments, even if they were lacking in variety. \n\n\nThe final season struggled with tracks outside of the action, which can be troublesome for such a dialogue-heavy season. These tracks are still effective in creating a depressing atmosphere, but there was an emphasis on piano and violin for any sad scene. This makes it hard to differentiate between them. Even with a handful of standouts, they were less interesting than the epic battle arrangements. \n \n\nThere are parts of *The Final Season*'s OST that rely too heavily on the influence of previous seasons, especially as the season progresses. However, this OST sets itself apart with wind-heavy instrumentation and some compositions that sound close to the 20th century. The new ideas come through especially in the new setting. The renaissance instruments in “Liberio Festival” or the emphasis on brass in “The Other Side of the Sea''. These tracks create a sense that Marley is a different country from Paradis. The modern styles also remind us that Marley is more advanced. All of that, in addition to stellar mixing for the action sequences, come together to create new iconic moments for the series. \n\n\n*Shingeki no Kyojin* earns its nomination with one of the most effective soundtracks from 2021. While there are stronger nominations which present more variation and original ideas, *The Final Season* has effective mood-setting music, smart composition, and more of the best action tracks in anime.",

The sound is unsettling, but is obviously building up to something - there is a sense of dread in the music. During a quick flashback we get some jarring reverberations before we get brought. Then the music gets louder and is presented more forward to the listener. The climax to this event is becoming closer by the second. We get a little more guitar sprinkled in as the violins grow in size and sound. The drums come in - and with each layer and addition of a new instrument, the size, scale, and presentation grows larger. The situation increasingly stressful, and music executes that emotion wonderfully. As the sound and instruments build up, our expectations and emotional investment follows suit. When Vasili finally realizes he was almost played, the camera pans up and a jolting sound accompanies this, perfectly matching the visuals. Once the gun goes off, it’s immediate - all else falls silent. All you can hear is breathing. The mental battle he has been struggling with is over. He has won. And then BANG! Our expectations are subverted, but the silence still creeps on from here…",

In addition to her tone, Sakamoto takes great care in the cadence of her speech in the middle of sentences, shifting them up as she goes, making her dialog feel rather natural. She is also able to highlight these technical aspects of her work through the use of monologue, as the show sets up Sakamoto for success in this regard.\n\nHowever, Sakamoto's rapport with the rest of the cast is less than stellar. The other cast members are so over-the-top that they overshadow Mayumi's more passive role. Additionally, Sakamoto's approach with Mayumi is not always logical in the feelings she chooses to express. For example, during a particularly intense moment in episode two, Sakamoto chooses to express a sense of confusion and exhaustion, rather than outright fear and panic.\n\nDespite these issues, Sakamoto's portrayal of Mayumi stands out as one of the better performances from this year. The direction taken can only come from Sakamoto, and the variety of technical aspects that allow her to breathe life into Mayumi is staggering.

That's the main appeal of her performance – she's voicing both child and adult Rika at the same time, creating two opposite styles of vocal delivery. \n\nAs a child, she's cute, energetic and has an overly polite switch pattern with a verbal tic. As an adult, she's jaded, often distant and introspective. Her adult version gets more focus as the series goes on, which allows Tamura to really demonstrate her dramatic range, especially when her character goes through multiple stages of despair and suffering. The way she manages to deliver sudden emotional outbursts, raw screams, or surprisingly natural transitions from laughing to crying made her performance especially captivating during the *Nekodamashi* and *Satokowashi* arcs.\n\nHer child Rika voice, on the other hand, sounds more manufactured. She is leaning way too much into character, which makes it lose some of the charm. The script also greatly limited her interaction with other characters, making her more an observer than a participant of the events. The only exception is Satoko, with whom she manages to create great chemistry and add a lot of nuanced reactions.\n\nNevertheless, her character managed to show incredible resistance towards the end of the series, greatly captured by Tamura's performance, which with the consideration of everything mentioned before helped her to secure third place in our rankings.",

She is introduced as a young girl who just suffered tragic loss, and Aoi Yuuki immediately jumps into the role with a whirlwind of emotions: sadness, anger, regret, despair. In order to embody the mentality of a young child, she uses few words and relies more on breathing and noises to convey feeling. As the story progresses, Biwa matures mentally despite not aging physically, and Aoi Yuuki represents this through notable changes in the way Biwa speaks and sounds.  Despite this, there are some aspects of the performance that felt lacking in emotional nuance or abundant in its repetitive nature, given the limited scope of the character. \n\nHowever, the hallmark of Biwa's performance is the singing.

These performances are powerful, a strong contrast to Biwa's normal speaking and a testament to Aoi Yuuki's masterclass skill as a voice actress. Aoi Yuuki is undeniably talented and, with Biwa ranking 6th overall in the jury nominations, earns the honor of being the only voice actor represented twice in the top 10.",

At times, the strain and force he puts into his words convey how warped Vanitas' worldview is. He hides his deepest emotions and pain well, and it's clear that there's something not quite right about Vanitas when you hear him. His acting aids in the atmosphere of the show, giving it an air of mystery.\n\nHe also has spectacular rapport with the rest of the cast, working wonderfully to convey various levels of affinity, with Noé or Jeanne serving as primary outlets for displaying his most intimate feelings. Hanae also absorbs himself into the role immensely well and manages to be rather convincing about not only his, but also Vanitas' passion. Which creates a character with believable drive and relationships.\n\nIt's a breathtaking performance in more ways than one and commands your attention while on-screen, truly a worthy winner for this year.",

          "writeup": "There have been a lot of anime idols, as well as several traumatized characters, but one would be hard-pressed to find a story of a singing robot saving the world. Vivy attends to this niche along with the talented Atsumi Tanezaki. Atsumi Tanezaki uses her skills to channel the unique niche of an Ersatz Vocaloid that saves humanity, whilst touching the world with the power of her song.\n\nWhile the strong story and fleshed-out character penned by *Re:Zero's* Tappei Nagatsuki helped, Atsumi Tanezaki's magnificent performance truly brought her robotic songstress character to life. It goes without saying that she was one of the best performances of the year, perfectly balancing the duality of Performer Vivy against the action-hero savior of the universe. Indeed, Vivy's status as an AI was not an impediment to her, given that she followed the tried-and-true tradition of being an 'AI' Character with more humanity than humans. Atsumi Tanezaki truly excelled in demonstrating how Vivy connected with others as well as tackling the philosophical nature of her nature as an AI and how this tied to her agency and free will.\n\nAtsumi Tanezaki had amazing chemistry and rapport with Matsumumoto, and it was always a joy to see her and her AI companion converse with such intriguing interplay. That and also the fact that Vivy's stoicism was a great contrast with Matsumoto's fast-talking nature certainly helped keep things interesting. And thus, for her strong and multi-faceted performance, Atsumi Tanezaki more than earned this second-place runner-up for this year's Voice Acting Category.",

With his sarcastic tone and witty humor, Sugita gives his take on the unsavory, pitiful, yet altogether human character of Rudy.\n\nRudy is frankly a terrible human being: manipulative, self-serving, and harboring resentment towards his past and people who have hurt his fragile ego. Sugita conveys this excellently with emotional and impassioned acting when Rudeus is talking about himself in contrast to a cold, aloof voice when narrating about others. Sugita is especially adept at conveying the lecherous and sleazy side of Rudeus with his intonation and phrasing, and every instance where the viewer wants to punch Rudy in the face is a testament to Sugita doing a fantastic job. However, the performance overall is shallow in comparison to the other nominations. Deadpan narration takes up a large portion of the performance, and there is a notable lack of nuance when considering the unique nature of Rudeus as a reincarnated youth - nuance that is ultimately conveyed through the voice acting of Yumi Uchiyama, Rudy's other half. \n\nSince Sugita's performance is merely one part of the bigger picture, it fails to represent the entirety of the character and ends up lacking the depth that the other nominees all possess. Despite this, Sugita's presence in the rankings demonstrates the sheer charisma that he has in bringing out the better of the worst half of Rudeus Greyrat.",

Faced with the challenge of a monologue-heavy performance and also having to speak quite fast, Kumoko is exciting to listen to.\n\nKumoko is a character that can be described with two main attributes: she thinks fast and also has quite an optimistic attitude. Because of this, Yuuki needs to deliver her lines very quickly for her role, but nails it just right. Her performance shines through her ability to push out very long sentences in a short period of time to give the viewer a glimpse into Kumoko's train of thoughts. Yuuki also seems to be enjoying herself with this role due to Kumoko's characteristically positive nature, and this in turn, makes Kumoko a very fun character. Although she managed to reach the tempo that's required of her, Yuuki's performance suffers due to her character's lack of emotional depth. As a result, Aoi Yuuki cannot flex with her vocal range because the character is limiting her performance in that regard. That can make the performance sound quite monotonous and demanding to listen to over a longer period of time.\n\nOverall it is a fun performance and Aoi Yuuki managed to capture Kumoko's ecstatic spirit with her technical abilities, especially her tempo. However, the lack of emotional range and the rather monotonous nature of her performance were the major factors that ultimately ranked her in seventh place.",

Kobayashi really eases in easily to the highs and lows of his character, which leads into Subaru slowly becoming louder and louder as he speaks, making his speeches a lot more heartfelt and genuine. His voice is also less cocky than before and it sounds more “trusting”. He has a much softer tone, he doesn't complain as much as he previously did, and his voice in general really adapts well to any situation where Subaru tries to convince someone, which is a considerable step-up from the previous cour. His interactions with the other cast members were also really endearing, especially with him and Beatrice, since they have their whole sister and brother-like relationship together.\n\nDespite the unusually large amount of speeches in the second part of Re:Zero, Yuusuke Kobayashi manages to put out a solid performance of Subaru Natsuki overall. Not only was he able to project Subaru's confidence convincingly, but his chemistry with the rest of the cast in general just felt a lot stronger as well.",

After all the high octane screaming of previous seasons, Eren's character suddenly calms down and Yuuki Kaiji delivers his lines in a really tranquil and restrained manner, which contrasts with what he previously did. The change still comes from all of Eren's development, and Kaiji clearly understood the intent behind it, so Eren's personality never truly disappears. His calm demeanor works in context with other more emotional characters, which strengthens his dialogues with key cast members.\n\nHowever, after the initial surprise of his big reveal wears off, it turns out there's nowhere to go. When the entire performance lives on low octave energy and a flat monotonous delivery, even some emotional reactions could be buried beneath it. As a result, it is really hard to tell if he was intentionally restraining himself, or if it's something Kaji couldn't properly portray, making the character sound really artificial and lowering an overall level of enjoyment.\n\nThere are still moments of brilliance sprinkled throughout Yuuki Kaiji's performance, mostly when he manages to pour just the right amount of emotion in response to some of Zeke, Mikasa and Armin's lines. Despite fighting hard and moving forward, his competition fought harder and moved further. As such, Yuki Kaji's performance as Eren Yeager earns ninth place.",

Various standouts were the Nichijou-esque intro sequence of “Ai no Supreme!” which was hailed by all jurors as one of the best of the year. “Hikaru Toki”’s implementation of negative space was a theory thoroughly explored and credited. A rather hot topic of discussion was “Taiga yo Tomo ni Naitekure”’s implementation of the 2.5D and the merging of it and the 3D space in the OP. Through a lot of back and forth between the jury, with various members being convinced one way or the other, we reached a solid list of ten nominees. \n \nThe jury had wildly varying preferences and most nominees were considered one of the best OPs of the year by someone, creating a field of competitors all capable of taking first. A lot of our entries would be a good fit on a best OP of all time list, but in the end we have one nominee which stands atop them all.",

Whether it's snappy transitions, breathtaking scenic shots, creative credits integration, or the repeated emphatic singing of the line “No matter what you say,” this OP has something to grab everyone's attention. Full of infectious energy from the very start, it certainly can't be accused of being forgettable.\n\n\n\nConsidering that the show itself revolves heavily around the father-daughter interactions between Gagumber and Memempu, it's no surprise that the OP would choose to focus on them from the get-go. Seeing them bickering with one another at the very beginning was a fitting starting point, and from there it developed into some effective gags, with the flashlight-shining sequence in particular being particularly effective.\n\n\n\nThe biggest drawbacks of this OP are the noticeable drop in energy in the second half and the utilization of reused assets from the series in some segments, which weren't even necessary. The way those assets are used isn't entirely uncreative, but it could at times be at least a bit distracting.\n\n\n\nThe song itself is fairly dynamic and is a large part of what makes the first half of the OP so energetic. The synchronization between song and visuals early on also helped significantly.  In the end, the combination of high-energy first half and more-subdued second half earned “Koukotsu Labyrinth” an eighth-place finish in the category.  ",

The breezy song and lively animation shows us the personality of these characters during peaceful times and the importance of their relationship as a family. As the series progresses events surrounding the family become increasingly grim and light-hearted moments like seen in the OP occur less and less. We start seeing important figures of this family lose hope or even perish. The warmth of its imagery turns into bittersweet memories that need to be preserved in times of grief, and the song's breezy tone takes on a melancholic, heartfelt feeling.\n \n\n\nDespite its emotional power, the OP at times left things to be desired visually. Its usage of “Ma” (A Heian-era style of minimalism) is commendable due to historical accuracy, but at times led to shots feeling slow and lengthy. The near 15-second title card followed by the very lengthy walk sequence is a prime example. It works well to provide a sense of buildup, but still isn't as visually interesting as it could be.\n\n\n\nHowever, these issues are only minor in comparison to how emotional, poignant and engaging this OP is through the way it plays into the change of tone in the series and the importance of these characters and their memories.

The opening combines these elements to make an experience worthy of recognition in these awards.\n\n\n\nThe first thing that catches the eye is the stark contrast between shadow and lighting, and how it makes the colors of this opening pop out. This is utilized with the fluid animation to make the characters pop against the background for an almost theatrical presentation. This is seen best in the dance sequence, where the movements, expressions, and dance style are emphasized as they are the sole focus in the shot, almost like a spotlight is being shined on them. The lack of detail in the backgrounds and clear focal points in each shot emphasize this and make it easy to follow for the viewer and it fits for this character-driven opening.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, fluidity and comprehensiveness are not present in each shot. The opening shines like a star when it has little visual noise, thus the more busy shots don't benefit from the contrast and vibrancy, instead making them more messy.\n\n\n\nOn the audial side, the playfulness and whimsicality of the opening is strongly supported by the song performed by sumika. The warm vocals coupled with the drum and piano heavy instrumentals add to the joyfulness and set the mood for the detectives and their hijinks.\n\n\n\nOverall, a fun, energetic yet classy opening that excels at what it tries to achieve, albeit for a couple mismatched shots, deserves a place in the best openings of the year, landing it in seventh place.",

The opening is reminiscent of a Hollywood-style action flick montage in the way it uses seamless transitions and suspenseful yet bombastic melodies to weave together a narrative in order to prepare you for the show. \n\n\n\n In a way, this is the perfect sequel opening. In contrast to the first opening, all the singers start singing in unison from the beginning showing their growth after the first season, rather than all the vocalists performing separate solo performances in the early half to then coming together in the latter. There's a great danger this season and there's no way you can miss it. From the PSA style call to action at the beginning, to the many references to danger, caution, and escape throughout the many motion graphics, there is a clear and well represented theme. The opening felt almost perfect. However, the main concern was that the opening was far more interesting in its transitions than it was in the actual subject matter of the shots, leaving more to be desired.\n\n\n\n*Zombie Land Saga: Revenge*'s opening contrasts the minimal iconography of its graphics with its more detailed characters while also allowing the objects in the opening to constantly shift and change, creating an aesthetic that allows for over-the-top references while also being a satisfying watch. This kinetic style also allowed for a brilliant pairing with the urgent yet powerful song, which altogether placed it at an impressive second-place spot.",

San San Week” makes a compelling case to that effect. Each scene is packed full of small details that hint at character personalities, establish themes for the story, or just serve as Easter eggs for the attentive viewer. Environments feel lived in, the animation reaches some impressive heights during the more dynamic sequences, and there's plenty of creative scene transitions and filming effects to enhance the experience. Additionally, framing the opening as an in-universe effort to create a promotional video adds an additional layer of character expression and justifies many of the filming decisions. This includes the music and lyrics, which are both sung by the characters and integrated into the background.\n\n\n\nThis isn't to say the opening is perfect. However, its few flaws are hardly enough to damage it significantly. Most significantly, there's little to find impressive musically about the actual song, though it's definitely fitting for the tone of the show. At best it comes off as fairly generic, but at worst it was, ironically, annoying. Still, any flaws are at most just moments of plain competence amongst excellence, so it's only natural that they would stand out. Considering the myriad of strengths this opening has, it's no wonder it managed to work its way into third place for the rankings this year.",

The song is effortlessly memorable while the “babadabada” in the opening scene flows in and out for each character's introduction. The intro shows off each character's personality with popping backgrounds, expressive movement, and dynamic camerawork all while they sing and dance along to the music.\n\n\n\nThe biggest boon for this opening is that there is distinct care taken for the synchronization between the visuals and music. Between the choreography, dancing, mouth movements, and background movement, it is animated very well and the liveliness of the OP cannot be overstated. The song is so memorable, the backgrounds move in and out with ease, and there is constant movement throughout this wonderful OP.\n\n\n\nWhile the first half of the opening leaned heavily into the strengths of dynamism and poppines, the second half of the OP had a clear drop in energy as it focused more on the relationship between Tooru and Kobayashi. While, the visuals and music represented this aspect well, it was undeniably less effusively charming. While not a weakness in it's own right, leaning away from its charm created a somewhat divided opening.\n\n\n\nWith snappy visuals and an effortlessly catchy song, “Ai No Supreme” did an amazing job at presenting the infectious energy of *Maid Dragon*. With that being said, it ended up rounding out our top five.",

          "writeup": "\"Cinderella\" is an opening that excels at many things, capturing the hearts of its audience in a variety of ways. From song to art, or narrative to spectacle, there is always something that will enchant a viewer.\n\n\n\nThe usage of pastel colors and solid shape shading gives it an aesthetic style that's both evocative and vivid in presentation. Whether it's the sharp contrast between grayscale and color, or an appreciation for the detailed backgrounds, the art for this opening can only be praised. On top of all of this, when combined with the smooth animation that's perfectly timed to the sharp beats of the music, viewers are presented with a spectacle that never fails to impress.\n\n\n\nThe opening's depiction of *Komi-san*'s melancholic yet optimistic adolescent story sets a new standard for a common setting. But whereas the broad structure of the opening is archetypal of the genre, its execution is anything but. The usage of overt symbolism like the forget-me-not flowers or more subtle touches such as body language or character interactions, blends together with the snappy visuals to paint an intricate snapshot of the show itself.\n\n\n\nTo top it all off, the opening song is captivating in both uniqueness and charm, invoking an atmosphere of youthful nostalgia with all the ups and downs associated with it. It's hard to find an opening like this one, and though its surface may appear familiar, there is no doubt that it brings a certain freshness to the table and outstrips the competition.",

          "writeup": "*Vivy: Fluorite Eye's Song*'s opening “Sing My Pleasure'' is Wit Studio's attempt at displaying their strong production values and beautiful storytelling in an opening format. Most notably, Kairi Yaigi's strong yet soothing voice carries this opening. It works well to support the dramatic mood of the animation sequence. The song's most interesting aspect, however, is that it serves as a callback to Vivy's important performances in the anime. \n\n\n\nHowever, one of the lowest points of this opening is that it reuses shots from the show whilst giving no care to their integration. This is most obvious during the second half of the chorus. The animation sequence features a random set of shots that break down the cohesiveness of the opening. In addition, the paneling in the first verse reuses shots in an unimaginative and unoriginal way, making for an uninteresting viewing experience. In this case, the reuse of shots makes it hard to see what the opening is trying to convey, revealing its shallow concept and lack of depth.\n\n\n\nIn spite of that, Vivy does feature moments of visual brilliance; it opens with an elegant title card and closes with an innovative time sequence. These scenes help uniquely encapsulate the tone of the show and even hint back at the anime's main plot points. Moreover, they serve as a gentle reminder to viewers that the opening can bring in an interesting element when it needs it.",

          "writeup": "Following on “Kaikan Kitan”'s popularity, the expectations for *Jujutsu Kaisen*'s second opening were high. “Vivid Vice” doesn't shy away from those expectations but pushes the envelope further by creating an even more demanding look.\n\n\n\nDirector Shingo Yamashita's usual rotating cameras, fixed sources of natural light, and reflections are strongly present. This time, however, they're used to build up a very sinister tone: camera movement creates an ominous tension, backlit characters make for dramatic shots, and dim reflections on cold surfaces give an unearthly feel. The cast's melancholic expressions juxtaposed by the enemy's grins strengthen this sensation.\n\n\n\nDespite its atmosphere, “Vivid Vice” doesn't offer a well-rounded experience. The narrative feels disjointed, offering referential snippets to the cour's events and future plot points almost like a montage, and the interplay between music and visuals is lacking compared to other nominees. Ultimately, it doesn't have much to say about the cast or story beyond setting the tone and ambiguously presenting plot points.\n\n\n\nStill, the production remains ambitious from a compositing standpoint. Beyond Yamashita's aforementioned classic techniques, semi-transparent objects, moving 3DBG integration, distorted reflections, and complex action sequences are all highly demanding to execute in compositing. Yamashita's team proves to be as skilled as it is ambitious by perfecting those demanding elements into a polished, unified aesthetic. Adding the brilliant animation from the likes of Kouki Fujimoto, Ren Onodera, and Nakaya Onsen, “Vivid Vice” is a visual marvel. Despite flaws too big to look past, “Vivid Vice”'s craftsmanship stands out and makes it the ninth-best opening of 2021.",

The character introductions are by far the strongest aspect of this OP. Each character in the show has one clearly defined arc, and the OP manages to condense each of these arcs into one sequence. For example, Kabisawa's head inflating as his phone feeds him stimulation accurately depicts how his ego inflates as his videos start to gain traction. Connecting these impeccable character portraits, Odokawa's scenes add levity to the dramatic character visuals, much like he does in the show. \n\n\n\nUnfortunately, the OP lacks an attention-grabbing aspect that stopped it from fading into the background. The extremely minimalistic design, calming song, and slow pacing, while making the OP unique, lack the weight of some more technically proficient or energetic OPs, especially among people who haven't seen the show. While the individual shots each connect with the show itself well, they also lack the visual impact of some stronger OPs. Lastly, the credits feel in the way of the visuals at points.\n\n\n\n“ODDTAXI“ may not have the jaw dropping visuals or infectious energy of some of our top contenders, but it perfectly houses the heart of its series and supports that heart with unique, well executed production. As a result, “ODDTAXI” sits at a well-deserved sixth place.",

Some EDs take the approach of exploring certain narratives or characters within the main story, such as “Yasashii Suisei”. Others instead choose to focus on the sound design, such as “Nai Nai”, while EDs like “Kaze to Iku Michi” excel at foreshadowing plot points from the source material. Regardless of approach, an ED can be proficient in a variety of ways, but similarly struggle because it fails in certain regards. \n \nThis year was particularly rough for ending sequences, as there were few EDs that weren’t criticized for mismanaging certain aspects of its presentation. The animation of  “Yasou to Hakuchuumu”, which has a stutter to its movement, stands out in an unappealing way. Another example is “Shirogane” that doesn’t blend its 2D and 3D sequences well, nor does it utilize its train interior sequence in any meaningful way. \n \nThe jury was generally in agreement with our first place pick of “Yasashii Suisei” from the very start, but no other ED from this year was unanimously liked among jurors. As such it became a race for second place with jurors being all over the place in regards to their preferences, leading to the entries with the fewest issues placing higher, rather than being placed by their merits.",

          "writeup": "“Lapis” places sixth in the rankings, as an entry placing its focus on symbolism. The ED uses a variety of art styles to create an unsettling air and a sense of disconnection while expressing itself artistically. The imagery throughout its sequences appear to relate to meaningful themes of the story, such as using the butterfly sequence as a way to represent ‘the end' along with rebirth. The lighting also stands out as a rather spectacular aspect, being used either as a transitional piece or to highlight the shadows in a dramatic way, which aids in creating the atmosphere.\n\n\n\nHowever, the sense of disconnection affects the overall cohesion of the ED, causing “Lapis” to come off as a mish-mash of ideas that work in isolation but don't tie into one another well. “Lapis” is not the most well-produced entry either, with poor consideration given to transitions from scene to scene within the ED. There are also certain sequences that have noticeably poor animation, or are almost devoid of animation.\n\n\n\nDespite these flaws, “Lapis” is a pretty good ending sequence. It's certainly helped by the chilling song with muted percussion and choir singing, giving the ED a sense of tranquility. The timbre of muted percussion and choir creates an ebb and flow effect within the song. These components of the song tie in well with the water thematic present in the visuals, and once again links back to the lyrical composition. These positives manage to outweigh the rather large flaws the ED has, creating a strong totality that more than deserves its nomination slot.",

          "writeup": "“MILK TEA” is a sleeper hit in the ED category nominations. On the surface the ending's song pairs well with its aesthetic, but has pacing issues. However, an intriguing depth is found in the intent behind the ending's features, as they draw inspiration from Saul Bass. Bass is a director and graphic designer who turned movie credits from a necessity into an art form. Some of the references featured here are the intro to Walk on the Wild Side (1960) and ending sequence from The Facts of Life (1960). Using the cat, Walk on the Wild Side is referenced, with the cat as a substitute for Lupin in the case of the male love interest. The cat represents the playfulness of Fujiko as well as show of some of her sex appeal as they stroll together through the city. The playfulness is later shown off more with innuendo in the ‘turn off the lights' sequence toward the end of the ED.\n\n\n\nBoth the references and the time period in which the references come from tie together this peaceful stroll through a retro 60's-70's London. A huge point of contention with this ED was the lack of animation. Some felt it left more to be desired while others felt it fit the tone of the ED. However, we all agreed it was cute and simple, yet effective.",

Every scene is packed full of expressive character animation, and each girl gets plenty of time in the spotlight. Creative use of camera angles and a brief time skipping effect also add a lot of visual flair to each shot, while the intricate background art brings the setting to life.\n\n\n\nIf there is anything holding this ending back, it is a lack of real ambition. It knows exactly what it wants to do and does it without any obvious shortcomings but it never steps outside its comfort zone, failing to do anything truly memorable. The character introductions in particular are pretty standard in their format, and really only touch on the surface level for each of the girls' personalities. \n\n\n\nNevertheless, it's not fair to fault “Mirai wa Kaze no You ni” for the things it could have done.

Its focus on Ibuki's relationship with Louis opens up a beautiful array of detailed character explorations. In the ED we see Ibuki navigate his new relationship with a herbivore, prompting reflection on the carnivorous nature within his identity. Through Ibuki's eyes we see Louis' antlers turn into a dense forest, and as he looks down into his drink Ibuki's own reflection turns into a gigantic lion's skull. Moments like these show the ED has striking narrative depth while also being visually gorgeous, utilizing its sharp but striking artwork to evoke a sense of reflectiveness and introspection.\n\n\n\nThe song's melancholic yet uplifting tone fits the bittersweet nature of the ED, and suits both the struggles and the warmth that Ibuki gains from this relationship. The lyrics tie together the story, singing about a meeting with someone that changes your worldview and allows you to face yourself as a result.\n\n\n\nThe relatively obstructive use of credits are a minor detail holding back “Yasashii Suisei”, but aside from that it is a striking, emotional, and incredibly well composed ED that no other nominee this year can rival.",

It's pretty to look at, but does little in both a narrative and structural sense to uniquely distinguish itself.

Beyond the art quality and the swelling nature of the song, there is nothing for the viewer to latch onto. The background doesn't really change and generally leaves the frame feeling empty, there's no motion or animation to draw the eye, and while there is some symbolism tied to Emilia, that symbolism feels quite shallow and doesn't have any additional characterization or connection to narrative. The lack of all this makes the entire minute and a half feel like it has a lack of energy or drive to pull the viewer through.\n\n\n\nEven with that lack of drive, the impressive production element and lively song earns this ED a spot among the best of the year.",

          "writeup": "Given the foreboding nature of *Shadows House*, \"Nai Nai\" does a great job at getting its intended atmosphere across. The breathy vocals are interrupted with sudden sound effects to keep tension rising towards the chorus, while the percussion utilizes wooden clacks, maracas, and synths to create a unique sound throughout. The second half is the payoff for this buildup, as the chorus hits with a much more panicked tone that builds again to an abrupt finish.\n\n\n\nThe visuals follow a similar pattern starting by shifting focus between residents to make an impression, while the second half plays back into the panicked tone with multiple quick cuts and the running scene. In addition to this, an anxious mood is created by both the beginning and ending, with the final shot calling back to the misleading start and revealing how large the real mystery looms.\n\n\n\nDespite succeeding in creating an atmosphere to accompany the show, the execution on all of these ideas was lacking just enough that this ended up in the bottom half of our list. The panning shots in the first half, long zoom out at the end, and especially the diary shot all linger on for too long and can kill some of the tension. This also plays into the relatively low amount of animation present throughout the ED, with only a few bits of actual movement (and not just effects), with most of those bits being reused at another point later on.",

Portrait sequence cut-outs give the perspective of a mobile phone camera video, with the earnest and melancholic vocals supporting a sobering and enjoyable moment at dusk with Yuuji and his friends.\n\n\n\nIt is a cute yet somewhat somber ending, with the perspective of Yuuji recording the scene for the majority of the ED, when his friends beckon him to come join them with open arms. It shows the camaraderie and friendship they all have together, providing a compelling narrative tie-in to Yuuji's trials early in the season. The chill tone of the vocals and colors match extremely well, and a washed-out sepia tone aesthetic for the backgrounds do a great job for providing a welcoming and calming atmosphere. These sequences provide a  relaxing ending to an otherwise intense show.\n\n\n\nHowever, detractors for the ED include a lack of animation when compared to other contenders. Particularly unimpressive vocals, the integration of the credits, and the overall slow pace were also seen as issues curbing the impact of “Give it Back.”\n\n\n\nDespite its issues, “Give it Back” was largely well-received. The phone camera film capture, attractive backgrounds, composition, and overall production were seen to be quite good. With that being said, it ends as a solid top half pick at fifth place.",

To celebrate its 20th anniversary, Toei brought back director Junichi Satou and character designer Yoshihiko Umakoshi to make a new movie both for fans and about the fans. With the help of original scriptwriter Takashi Yamada and new director Haruka Kawatani, *Majo Minarai wa Sagashite* focuses on an entirely new cast of characters, representing a new generation of fans, and thereby combines old and new outlooks on the Doremi franchise, thus representing different generations of fans. \n\n\n\nThe movie recaptures both the look and spirit of Doremi with expressive animation, usage of the TV show's soundtrack and similar treatment of magical elements. The genuine character interactions of Mire, Sora and Reika are delightful to watch, and similarly to the original series, the movie does not shy away from showing its characters' failures and shortcomings. It maintains a cartoony presentation but tackles most of its issues realistically.\n\n\n\nHowever, the movie has some structural problems. It plays out like a collection of stories, loosely connected with one another, with some of its parts hitting stronger than the rest. Mire's character arc also resolves too quickly and positively, making her the least developed out of the three leads.\n\n\n\nBut still, the movie successfully recreates the magic of the original series for the fans and transforms its core themes for new viewers, leaving a strong impression.",

But this “striving for perfection” is what makes *Eiga Daisuki Pompo-san* so captivating. Every individual element of the movie is strong on its own, but at the same time, they are also all integral to the full picture: lively character designs, vibrant backgrounds, snappy dialogue, catchy insert songs and creative visual transitions. Everything exists first and foremost for entertainment, and to make a perfect movie-going experience for the viewer. Director Takayuki Hirao efficiently packs information using his masterful control of time and editing, delivering a briskly paced film experience.\n\n\n\nAs with many other movies about movies, *Pompo* doesn't bother with a realistic portrayal of the movie industry, and its characters serve more as a reflection of a certain type of person from the movie crew. However, the film uses the oversimplified nature of its characters to its advantage, focusing on strikingly evocative individual scenes and allowing the viewer to imagine everything that was left off the final cut. This was apparent with the \"Meister\", the movie within the movie, which was made especially more dramatic and thought provoking.\n\n\n\n*Pompo* is the brightest example of a modern anime movie, and from the strong impression it left, it managed to get to the very top.",

          "writeup": "A long awaited return for the franchise, the *Shirobako Movie* revisits its beloved cast and takes a fitting new angle to explore the anime industry – creating a film. Aoi is the star throughout, driving the film's focus on the struggles one may face when doing something they love. Despite the film's dispiriting opening, an impressive musical number quickly picks the tone up with creative presentation and animation. This energy permeates throughout the entire film, fueling its message of optimism and perseverance.\n\n\n\nWhile nearly every character from the TV series gets a moment to shine, this strains the spotlight as a consequence. The film reduces old favorites to their most recognizable traits or vehicles for classic jokes, and under-utilizes new additions to the cast such as Kaede. Aoi's personal arc is strong, but no one else receives much meaningful development. The film's “highlight reel” approach limits its ability to explore more interesting aspects of the anime industry; it brushes over showcasing the actual production process – a major strength of the show – in favor of the slow first act and showing off the cast.\n\n\n\nThe climax of the movie has some jarring CG, but is otherwise full of fun animation and serves as a fitting conclusion to the film. This, along with Aoi's attack on the rival company, are a pair of imaginative scenes that capture the passion and hope *Shirobako* embodies, ending the film on a high note. Although the *Shirobako Movie* ends up playing it too safe, its abundance of undeniably fun character moments and strong thematic core make for an enjoyable film.",

Thankfully, *Kidou Senshi Gundam: Senkou no Hathaway* is a fine adaptation of Yoshiyuki Tomino's novel sequel to *Char's Counterattack* and an excellent film! *Hathaway* serves as an interesting set-up for its trilogy and does excellent work with establishing the untapped potential of its setting in the late-era Universal Century. However, because it's the first in a trilogy it focuses mostly on set-up and world-building, thus lacking closure.\n\n\n\nThe production is breathtaking, with gorgeous hyper-realistic character designs, fully fleshed out locales, and of course a gritty depiction of the societal upheaval brought about post *Gundam Unicorn*. Sadly, the combat and mecha are clunky CGI, and the 'Main' Gundam is literally a flying Mecha Dorito, which clashes with the serious and grounded atmosphere that the story did such a fine job in portraying.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the well-handled story, the movie does a great job creating compelling and interesting leads, with Hathaway as the tormented young man caught between Amuro and Char's worldviews, Gigi as the mysterious ingénue who knows how to toy people into dancing in the palm of her hand, and Kenneth as the hotshot Federation jerk. These characters share fascinating interactions and compelling dynamics amongst each other which hooks the audience. \n\n\n\nOverall, *Kidou Senshi Gundam: Senkou no Hathaway* was entertaining and a worthy entry in the storied UC Gundam Timeline, more than earning its third place finish.",

The shopping mall setting, while looking out of place at first because of some CGI, becomes more lived-in due to the detail poured into its design. From the bustling shops to the rooftop hangout spots and the graffitied haiku poems, the mall adds another dimension to the story all on its own.\n\n\n\nThe film's willingness to experiment with its color choices, on the other hand, offers mixed results. There are also visual hiccups, with CG backgrounds clashing with other composited assets and high brightness making some scenes difficult to look at. The story unfortunately slows down after a dynamic start, with some forced and contrived external developments to move the plot forward. \n\n\n\nHowever, Smile and Cherry's endearing chemistry easily overshadows these shortcomings, as they overcome their relatable flaws throughout the course of the film. *Cider* might be low-key, but the film still captures beautifully the magic of growing up and falling in love for the first time. Hence, it sits comfortably right in the middle spot - fifth - on this list.",

The Gintoki fight was not only one of the most visually impressive and intricately choreographed battles in the franchise, but for the entire movie category. Sadly, this did not quite apply for the rest of the animation, which at times suffers from mediocre CGI and animation.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, the movie, while great for Gintama fans, is *not* user-friendly. The movie's disjointed structure is not ideal for the uninitiated, starting with a rapid-fire parody recap before swiftly diving into the deep end.\n\n\n\nThat said, for fans of Gintama, this movie appropriately and fittingly delivers. There is a *lot* of Gintama material, which can seem daunting, but the movie more than makes the journey worthwhile.

As the final film of the Rebuilds, it re-contextualizes the previous entries, clarifying their relationship to the original series, the creators, and the audience. Evangelion has always been an intimately personal series, and *Shin Evangelion* is no exception. The film's first section is slow and deliberate, meticulous in its portrayal of the beauty of humanity and the planet. This hopeful outlook is a refreshing change for the franchise, which so often shines its lights on human flaws and its harsh decaying world. Fittingly, beautiful backgrounds and nuanced character animation are the visual highlights of the first act rather than the intense fights or oppressive directing common to the franchise.\n\n\n\nThe film's second half takes a turn towards the familiar action of the Rebuilds, before taking a deep dive into the psyche of Shinji and Gendo. The final confrontation is full of imaginative and surreal imagery, but the emotional core of their relationship is poignant and touching. Shinji is at his best here, he wants to grow and move forward — a striking contrast to his stagnant nature at the film's start. While not particularly subtle, the message hits home: this is the end of Evangelion, and it's time to move on.

The theme of communication is extensively explored through letters and the addition of new technology was fitting with the positives and negatives of man-made letters and telecommunication touched on meaningfully. The sidestories fit the movie thematically through the usage of flash forwards to show the application of letter writing even with new technology in the mix. Yuri's story is emotionally poignant and highlights the strengths of using Violet in a more observatory role while allowing the themes to do the heavy lifting. Sadly, Violet's romantic developments weren't as impressive due to Gilbert's lack of character along with it somewhat contradicting the messaging of the TV series with regards to Violet needing to move on from her past. Visually it was stunning with the extremely detailed character designs not hindering the animation whatsoever. The amount of detail put into every single movement of motion strongly conveys a lot of the characters emotions and is a large part of why the film is impressive.

Unfortunately, *Mugen Ressha-hen* has serious pacing issues, with the first half being too slow compared to the rushed second half. In addition, because most of the settings in the film take place either within the train or at night, the film doesn't look as appealing; the CG elements can also be distracting at times - the CGI tentacles being the worst offender. Nezuko and Zenitsu are reduced to comic relief, their dream sequences especially stuck out like sore thumbs. On the positive side, Rengoku is the star of the film and his overall heroic arc and backstory is compelling and well presented. In terms of production values, the final extended combat is one of the zeniths of the film. In general, *Mugen Ressha-hen* earns its place as a worthy nomination for this category, but its flaws are too apparent preventing it from ranking any higher.",

        "blurb": "With over 300 eligible nominees, there was a huge variety among the candidates in the Short Film category. Everything from professionally-developed commercials, music videos, and teasers to student art films had a fair shot at receiving a coveted nomination.  Western artists got in on the action too, with Ed Sheeran's “Bad Habits” and Porter Robinson's “Musician” in particular generating a fair amount of discussion. Eligible entries were also continuously added throughout the jury process, with *Takano Intersection* being the most notable example of a late entry that still placed well. \n \nMore than any other category, Short Film was always going to lose quality nominees when it came time for the finalists to be announced, due to having so many eligible entries and so few spots. Tough choices had to be made, and some entries that had generated significant amounts of discussion and which enjoyed a fair bit of support were cut at this point. The music videos for *Dokuhaku* and *p.h.,* as well as the student films *A Pawn* and *About You,* are a few examples of worthy contenders that ultimately didn’t make the final cut. \n \nWith such fierce competition, there was no single clear favorite going into the final vote. All of the top contenders had significant support, with each excelling in some way. In the end, Heikousen’s complete package of stellar execution, audiovisual sync, and an effectively-conveyed narrative managed to propel it to a close win, narrowly beating out *Takano Intersection* and *The Naked King*.",

The narrator is a large girl with body image issues and a crush on the pretty girl in class, and the short handles this subject matter with remarkable sensitivity and intimacy. The voice acting for the protagonist is raw and unfiltered, making her dialogue feel almost like a precious secret that she's entrusting the viewer with.\n\nThe minimalist art style further adds to the rawness of the short, evocatively portraying a wide range of different body types and movements. This simplicity allows for a clear distinction between how the protagonist views herself and how she views Emi. A sparse use of color also helped fully convey the short's intimate actions and emotions, with reds saved for erogenous zones and expressions of emotion. \n\nThe simplicity of visual techniques on display is a double-edged sword,  enhancing the intimacy of the story but also hindering it next to some of the more technically impressive nominees. However, it does allow the short to portray complex emotions in a clear, accessible manner. In the end, *Kata no Ato*'s ability to unambiguously convey its intimate story propelled it to a sixth-place finish.",

The camera starts with an extreme close up as the girl is trying to hide her heartbreak, but slowly zooms out to a medium shot as the video goes on and the girl loses her inhibitions. The line art thickens with the beat at choice moments of maximum synchronicity, and even desyncs ever so often with the colored shape to signify the confusion in her heart until she lets her hair out and starts confidently dancing. Additionally, the quality of the rotoscoped dancing with its expressive outstretched limbs, flailing hair, and crisp fabric work makes for a really engrossing experience. \n\nDespite these emotive strengths, the limitations in scope and the song being hit or miss means *Mahou no Uta* ultimately lands in a still formidable fourth place.",

The muted palette and varied line art build a distinct aesthetic with strong expressiveness and clarity. Washed-out backgrounds and an ambient soundscape combine to bring the titular intersection to life with care and detail visible in every frame. The ragged breath of joggers, rumble of passing cars, and unsteady creak of a child's bicycle all ground the story in a mundane reality. To contrast, the designs are unique and expressive, conveying the poignant emotions at the core of the film. The linework allows for diversity in expression and movement through variation in line weight. A young girl's struggle to keep up with the group is instantly communicated by her heavy footsteps juxtaposed against the light smears of the others. \n\nThese aesthetic strengths are key to the film's success, as storytelling is almost entirely non-verbal. Small nuances in character interactions, or an emotional epiphany, are all captured through the audio-visual presentation. *Takano Intersection* highlights the intimate relationships between strangers that can form from seemingly trivial actions and the profound impact they can have. Despite the initial disconnect between the three character's stories, they are masterfully interwoven by the end. As the characters' stories intersect, their similarities are revealed, presenting a unified message about overcoming one's own pain to aid in the plight of others. *Takano Intersection*'s unique visual strengths, crisp sound design, and cathartic emotional storytelling make for an exemplary runner up.",

From a visual perspective, excellent design work can be found throughout. The color design takes a world that is very structurally similar to our own and makes it feel appropriately alien. Paired with great background art, character design, and prop design, the MV is littered throughout with shots that are absolutely stunning. This is nothing to speak of the animation, which very few would even attempt to argue is not the strongest animation in the category.\n\nThe thematic storytelling in the MV might even be stronger in the visuals. Even on just a surface level, the story of a human and their demon fighting to be together is an emotional and powerful narrative. It doesn't take too much digging to find the parallels and references that are common in Rapparu's work. The short covers struggles deeply personal to the transgender experience including gender dysphoria, body dysmorphia, and discrimination just to name a few. It packs these themes in a package that is easily accessible regardless of whether viewers have personally felt or dealt with these issues or not. Ultimately, the short is more than deserving of recognition.",

While the *IDOLM@STER* series has always stood apart in its focus on traditional animation when its peers rely on 3DCG, even its upcoming anime is moving to a CG pipeline. Given these circumstances, the decision to bring back most of the crew of the 2011 anime to put on a traditionally animated, large-scale performance with incredibly fluid dance choreography and dynamic character movements gives *VOY@GER* a notably distinct feel. The music and vocals also complement the aesthetics and performance well and deliver an excellent live performance that anyone, not only idol fans, can appreciate. \nHowever, *VOY@GER* is still ultimately just an idol live performance. It has a brilliant, polished production, but lacks in terms of storytelling. The performance will also have significantly less of an impact on audience members who are not familiar with the series, ultimately detracting from its effectiveness when considered as a stand alone short film. The music video stands in fifth place due to its stellar visual production and dance choreography, but falls short to competitors that told a more complete story.",

Standout bits like the bewitching, Naoka Nakayama-animated dance sequence wherein Marine breaks apart into her alternative outfits while seductively crooning “onegai choose me,” or the infinite Matryoshka zoom into her eyes during the build up to the drop are moments of pure, catchy synchronicity. These little touches stick in one's mind and stay there like a visual earworm.\nBeyond those highlights though, the abundance of character still shots feel out of place for such a high energy song. The overt repetition of its limited assets, while fitting to the dreamlike nature of the video, inevitably loses its impact over time. Bookending the MV with the viewer dozing off to this liminal, vaporwave bonanza and waking up to the dangerously cute sneeze animated by Eri Irie was an inspired final touch, landing *Unison* at a sweet seventh position as the best Hololive-related media in the category.",

The emotional impact that an all-star team of creatives is able to impart with this simple premise is nothing short of breathtaking. Eve is joined by Suis for a duet that perfectly captures the highs and lows of childhood bonds, with the perspectives and feelings of each coming across crystal-clear throughout the song.\nAnimation director Kitoyaka Oshiyama leads this talented group who manage to pack every moment with enchanting character animation. Whether it's the goofiness of two kids hamming it up as they run backwards towards each other, or the stilted movements of two teenagers understanding how they'll soon be separated from their longtime best friend, the emotions are conveyed poignantly. Thoughtful attention to small visual details further help bring this story to life, such as the way the boy repeatedly adjusts his family's sign or how homemade paper airplanes ride the air currents.\nStellar execution and production allowed this childhood story as bittersweet as chocolate to resonate so powerfully that it earned first place as the best Short Film.

The lyrics tell a story about Suisei's inner psychology, her thoughts, and anxieties as she struggles to figure out her identity as a VTuber. The song represents the emotional turmoil she faces as she struggles behind-the-scenes to understand her place in the world as a content creator. The title “ghost” draws parallels to how VTubers somehow exist, yet don't at the same time, and how Suisei struggles to find her relationship with the fans due to the inherent distance between them.\n\nThe astronomy and night sky visual themes are a nice touch, as is the simple pleasantness of some of the visual shots. The song also features catchy instrumentals and emotional vocals. However, the repetitive still shots and lack of movement throughout the MV is a big mark against *GHOST*, as the stillness significantly detracts from any potential emotional resonance. Additionally, the imagery in the MV lacked the substance and nuance found in many of the more highly-ranked short films.

Kyoto Animation used this opportunity to foster new young talent; newbie director Haruki Sakamoto gets a chance to shine, and Tamami Tokuyama receives her first character design and animation direction credits. The short succinctly captures the joy of creative imagination stemming from mundane everyday experiences. The idea of being stuck daydreaming since childhood brings the characters together, their shared passion and imagination never faltering as they grow up. It's fitting that a short about the power of young people's creativity is helmed by up-and-coming artists.\n\nThe CM clearly embodies the classic Kyoto Animation style, with round, expressive designs and clear care put into the smallest details. Despite its strengths, it's not perfect visually. Transitions during the first half could flow better and the CG animation feels a bit lifeless.

Although, arguably it only adds to the bizarre and uneasy atmosphere the show is aiming for with its off-kilter cinematography and kooky sound design.\n\nWhile the show is an episodic character study whose brief wishes and struggles might be hit or miss for the audience depending on personal experience, it also runs a background through line which gives the show more depth. During the course of the series, its main character, Nina, goes from the witch gleefully granting wishes to doubting the efficacy of her actions and their results.

From the subtle changes in the landscape in terms of emotional responses from the girls, to the careful accompaniment of Aimer's soundtrack, *Yoru No Kuni* develops an utterly beautiful world.\n\nThus, it takes the crown as it is simply bounds ahead of the rest of the competition in terms of audiovisual excellence, storytelling, and character writing.",

          "writeup": "One of the best stop-motion projects in recent memory, *Pui Pui Molcar* is incredibly unique, charming, and quirky. It is a bizarre world where people drive sentient vehicles that are hybrids between guinea pigs and motor vehicles. With each episode being short and usually focusing on solving a problem, *Pui Pui Molcar* delivers a surreal and adorable comedy in bite-sized pieces. Each episode has a unique storyline and delivers eccentricity as well as amusing comedy. \n\nThe use of humans inside the cars and the “live” aspect is less than exceptional, despite occasionally presenting a fun aesthetic dichotomy. Other times, the “live” aspect creates a conflicting visual style with the superior Molcar aesthetic and the cloth world that make both halves less powerful.\n\nInterestingly, the blending of real-world stop-motion animation is a strength of the Molcar sequences, creating an environment that feels distinct and alive. The fabric and creativity of the felt world make it seem homey and inviting. The camerawork is also creative, with various scenes having multiple angles and compositions that create a fluid and wonderful aesthetic presentation. The bright, vibrant color scheme brings every scene to life, while the sound design supports its comedic timing and maintains a sense of realism. \n\nOverall, *Pui Pui Molcar* is simply fun to watch while being full of life and energy. It is rare to find such simple fun in a show, let alone a stop-motion one. As such, the relentlessly charming *Pui Pui Molcar* takes home a well-deserving second place.",

          "writeup": "*Ganbare, Douki-chan* is a pleasant surprise, as the adaptation ends up being less ecchi and more of a sweet adult rom-com. The show utilizes its runtime well, as introductory episodes that establish its formula give way to later episodes that deliberately subvert the expectations set by this formula for great comedic and romantic effect. \n\nThe comedy is strong, and the side characters add enough flavor to maintain the show's interest. The romantic leads, aka the two “doukis,” develop a charming, subtly expressed romance, and their chemistry results in many fantastic moments. Whether it be stumbling home from bars, office parties, or Valentine's Day antics, perhaps missing the typical high school over-the-top bits is a nice change of pace. Additionally, the character design is spot on and pleasing, with Douki-chan standing out in particular. \n\nUnfortunately, some other aspects of the show's production fall off as the show progresses.  While the character designs remain consistent, the melting of the show's visuals increasingly grows. Coupled with weak, nearly non-existent backgrounds, the animation appears stiffer over time as well. Regardless, *Ganbare, Douki-chan* maintains being a worthwhile watch with its short episodic runtime telling a compelling romance story, thus landing in sixth place.",

          "writeup": "Featuring everyone's favorite slightly-ahistorical servants, *Fate/Grand Carnival* is a look into the lighthearted side of the well-known franchise. A large number of different beloved characters make an appearance in a relatively short time frame, although some only briefly. With many different servants featuring in gags in which they can shine, *Grand Carnival* manages to create a short addition to the franchise that appeals to fans of almost any individual character from that franchise.\nWith a variety of different skits and gags, there is something for everyone's different comedic sensibilities. One skit that is widely successful is the YouTuber gag, as it perfectly captures the idiosyncrasies of the platform while fitting the established personalities of Ereshkigal and Osakabehime. However, the downside to the decision to go for broad appeal is that it also means that nearly every viewer will be presented with some bits that will not work for them. Additionally, the generic chibis that the series occasionally cut away to further disrupts the comedic flow, as their usage adds little to the series and prevents those scenes from having the same expressiveness as the rest of the short. \n\nThe character dynamics are another high point for the short series, as it allows for multiple jokes about the power imbalance that exists between different servants. Some servants are more useful than others, and this series lets that be known loud and clear. In the end, the hit-or-miss nature of *Fate/Grand Carnival*'s comedy lead it to an eighth-place finish.",

The characters are effortlessly charming and dynamically bounce off of each other. Series Director Mamoru Hatakeyama's storyboarding continues to be stellar, with even trite material becoming engaging, clever transitional elements like the back alley with the porn magazine neatly threads the disparate segments, and theatrical framing, such as putting a spotlight on Fujiwara as she feigns her abilities as a food critic, enhance the effectiveness of the gag. \n\nHowever, a lot of the most interesting visual ideas are not able to be executed to the heights of the second season, as this OVA feels like a low-priority production put out as a stop-gap before the upcoming third season. The exception to this are the fanservice scenes, which do have an oomph to their animation, but the inclusion of those scenes is contentious from a conceptual standpoint, and the production resources would have been better spent elsewhere.\n\nThe OVA's usage of self-aware jabs to justify its amount of fanservice also feels awkward with the delivery being far more comfortable and consequently funnier during the short cooking segment at the end. Given these issues the OVA could only rank as high as seventh despite being fairly enjoyable for most.",

With each episode helmed by a different director and studio (all given plenty of creative freedom), the individual stories feel like an exciting new tale while still tying into the iconic Star Wars mythology.\n\nEach episode features a different art style, ranging from the spectacular and sleek presentation of Hiroyuki Imaishi's “The Twins” to the gritty black-and-white aesthetic in Takanobu Mizuno's “The Duel.” There is also no shortage of audiovisual spectacle, such as the stunningly animated climax of ”Lop and Ocho” by Kai Igarashi, and creative ambition in the anthology, such as Eunyoung Choi's unique spin on a traditional Star Wars tragedy in ”Akakiri.”\n\nHowever, *Star Wars: Visions* is also the most divisive short, as it consists of varying strengths and weaknesses that spread across independent of each episode. For that, the episodes do not easily show which are the strongest and weakest, which is rather befitting for an anthology with creative voices targeting different niches in mind. Still, some episodes such as ”Akakiri” and ”The Village Bride” were more successful than other episodes like “Tattooine Rhapsody” due to differences in effectiveness of storytelling and such.\n\nOverall, *Star Wars: Visions*'s audiovisual marvels and artistic ambition lead the anthology to land at a respectable fourth.",

Both offered immersive experiences by excelling in all areas, especially at script and other aspects of production such as background art. They were tied down until the end even but the jury ultimately appreciated the visual storytelling of *Sonny Boy* more, resulting in it becoming the best anime of 2021 for them.",

Expressive and flexible designs lead to some of the most memorable moments of animation this year. Static shots and an emphasis on integrating backgrounds into the visual language creates a tense atmosphere that lingers over the series. This is mirrored by the feelings of dissatisfaction and longing shared by the lively and likable cast— their individual arcs weaving together to create the thematic core at the heart of *SSSS.Dynazenon*. \n\n\n\nThe five main characters all explore grief and dysfunction in distinct and compelling manners, from Yume's uncertainty about her sister to Gauma's regrets of a past long gone. The cast's  tight chemistry spurns development, and these bonds form the basis of their growth. The Kaiju Eugenicists offer a collection of fun and varied personalities while undergoing meaningful arcs of their own.\n\n\n\n*SSSS.Dynazenon*'s presentation transitions from nuanced character drama to hot-blooded mecha-on-kaiju action at a moment's notice, flipping from subdued to bombastic seamlessly. Kai Ikarashi's episode 10 stands out from the myriad highlights of the show, brilliantly concluding character arcs with striking audiovisual presentation. A powerfully cathartic experience, the episode is one of the best in all of anime. All of *SSSS.Dynazenon*'s pieces come together to create one of the most cohesive and complete show's of the year, garnering a deserved third place.",

          "writeup": "*Non Non Biyori Nonstop* picks up right where previous seasons left off, combining superb comedy and relaxing slice-of-life moments into a lovely package. Of course, simply repeating a formula isn't enough, and *Non Non Biyori Nonstop* meaningfully adds to its already successful recipe. New characters, particularly Shiori and Akane, add depth to existing characters, such as Renge's newfound older sister role. Needless to say, these additions don't detract from the series's hallmark strengths. Excellent cast chemistry and immaculate comedic timing continues with lighthearted, natural sounding dialogue. Renge is great as always, but her aforementioned dynamic with Shiori is truly a highlight. Side characters get increased emphasis, as Candy Store and Konomi have more frequent and varied skits.\n\n\n\nProduction is a mixed bag: the OST remains equal parts whimsical and atmospheric, the voice acting delivers childlike excitement to fuel comedic moments, and the bucolic backgrounds sell the laid-back atmosphere. Other production aspects, however, leave much to be desired, with animation offering the bare minimum and other visual production being similarly economical.\n\n\n\nGiven this is likely the final entry, fans may be satisfied with the show's typical fare,, but *Non Non Biyori Nonstop* changes as much as it maintains the status quo. Graduation and childbirth demarcate a newfound focus on endings and beginnings. Eventually things will change, even the idyllic world of *Non Non Biyori Nonstop* - but that's not necessarily bad. Renge put it best:\n\n\n\n>  “It's not the same route every day. When it's rainy or cloudy, it's a little bit different. That's what's fun.” \n\n\n\nSumming it all up, it's easy to see why this was a truly excellent work. ",

          "writeup": "Presenting a historical tale about the fall of the once mighty Taira clan during the Genpei War, *Heike Monogatari* emphasizes the Buddhist truth that all existence is impermanent. Reflecting on this idea about the ever-changing state of all things, the anime ambitiously explores the shortsightedness of a pursuit towards worldly power, the collective's relation to fluctuating social values, and the individual's necessity to accept the inevitable decay of all things they hold dear.\n\n\n\nDespite the grand stakes, the portrayal of the cast is endearingly human, from the joyously emotive animation to the lighthearted dialogue. Due to this great balance of very human characters with poetic fates, *Heike Monogatari* offers some of the best written characters of the year, while also providing emotionally resonant journeys with each of them.\n\n\n\nThe visuals triumph in elevating those emotions. Immersive sceneries, emotionally charged visual motifs, poignant compositions that guide viewers through the whole shot, harmonizing color schemes, and meticulous shot pacing all combine to produce impactful moments throughout the series.\n\n\n\nWhile the imitation of woodblock printing aesthetic evokes a sense of history, the incorporation of modern elements, like the OST's electronic instrumentals, create a daringly time-transcending work. This ties to the intriguing meta-awareness about retelling a tale repeated through centuries, embodied in the anime original protagonist Biwa, a biwahōshi storyteller aware of the story's ending since the beginning.\n\n\n\nAs an adaption of a Japanese classic epic filled with ambition and compassion, *Heike Monogatari* is a must-watch from 2021.",

          "writeup": "No better word describes *Sonny Boy* than an \"experience\". The anime is a vibrant and personal venture through the worldview of its director, Shingo Natsume. With the ever present trend of the anime industry to push for the next big hit, rarely do such flexible and freeing productions for anime come to fruition. That isn't to say that being 'fresh' is commendable by itself - execution is a crucial factor, something in which the show evidently excels.\n\n\n\n*Sonny Boy* offers much intrigue through its storytelling, though it thrives further beyond its high school sci-fi and mystery premise. While largely a \"coming-of-age\" focus, the thematic strengths of the narrative tie the whole product together through empathizing the ideals of its characters. The show's relatively episodic structure and diverse cast offers many opportunities for the core cast to collaborate with each other, creating impressively emotive and understandable character developments throughout the series.\n\n\n\n*Sonny Boy*'s visual front is phenomenal - its crisp and clean drawings, carefully managed compositing, and its creative and sincere framing and storyboarding are all outstandingly executed. A facade of simplicity and minimalism complements the more thought-provoking and human sequences. Generous character animation conjures additional depth from expressions and movements, bringing the feelings of the cast to the forefront.\n\n\n\nThe show's soundscape is tremendous as well. *Sonny Boy*'s soundtrack and the utilization of it was among the best exhibited throughout the year. Individual tracks were intimate, refreshing, and varied in instrumentation, complementing the fluctuating tone of the series. An emphasis on silence throughout offered the strong seiyuu cast space to flavor the gaps, while the most impactful scenes were accompanied by excellent insert songs.  Its sound design was also noteworthy, bringing believable life to the bizarre worlds featured.\n\n\n\nThe factors above combine into a cohesive and shining entry, granting *Sonny Boy* the title of Anime of the Year for 2021.",

          "writeup": "*Vivy: Fluorite Eye's Song* burst onto the scene this year as an original anime whose futuristic setting, frenetic fight scenes and android idol protagonist quickly gained it a large following despite starting off with little fanfare. Its focus on the “one-task directive” for its android characters provided an opportunity to explore the setting in a way rarely seen in previous sci-fi anime.\n\n\n\nThe series starts off strong, solidly establishing a distinct atmosphere with its dystopian portrayal of a robot uprising. The self-contained nature of subsequent arcs, however, led to a lack of cohesiveness in its overall narrative. This caused the worldbuilding of the series to be noticeably shallower than needed for its setting, with Archive's role in particular having a huge impact on the series while receiving little to no depth or exploration.\n\n\n\nThe production was a mixed bag, with elements such as the OST alternating between effective and forgettable. At certain points the visual production showcased eye-catching fight scenes, while at other times it stumbled, such as in the battle between Vivy and Kakitani in episode 9. The character designs read well throughout, but there were moments where the choice of backgrounds didn't mesh well with them.\n\n\n\nSlick fight choreography was one of the most consistently successful aspects of the series, as the battle scenes repeatedly showcased an engaging ebb and flow in their combat. In the end, the mix of intriguing premise with hit-or-miss execution led to a tenth place finish for the show. ",

The show's distinct character designs, good sense of choreography communicated through its storyboards, and brisk narrative pacing accentuates its frequent brawls. Characters such as Yuji, Gojo, or Sukuna feel quite distinct - they have good vocal delivery and refreshing interactions with other members of the cast, rounding out those characters and the setting altogether.\n\n\n\nDue to the combative nature of the story, introducing a group of “special grade” curses as our primary antagonists has been a mixed decision. While it creates an interesting point in the plot due to the categorization itself becoming arbitrary, it also has led to a lack of urgency in the fights. These constant clashes remove much needed tension and their outcomes feel unrewarding. \n\n\n\nThe show has a garish art direction and mixed compositing that often harms its greater assets, namely seen in bad blending between characters and their background or thinning smoke. Occasionally weak visual cleanup on the animation either lessens the impact from blows or weakens the timing of character actions.\n\n\n\nThat being said, the fights themselves are executed well, with notable highlights including visual clarity, the retention of curse effects, and high caliber close-ups. Fight styles are unique for each character and the sound direction syncs the OST and fights in an evocative and memorable manner. ",

          "writeup": "*Shingeki no Kyojin* airdrops into its final arcs with another solid installment. This season gives a much-needed alternate perspective as it follows Reiner, Gabi, and Falco. Seeing them confront the propaganda that has shaped the lives and morals of his home country emphasizes how much he has changed since the beginning of the series. The characterization isn't limited to these characters, though; many have compelling development that reflects their experiences in previous seasons.\n\n\n\nThis season, Studio Mappa takes over for Studio Wit, and although the production is still satisfying, it has some shortcomings. The compositing is inconsistent and distracting. For example, the 3D titans don't blend with the grimy aesthetic of the show. Splitting the season in two also caused pacing problems: instead of a cohesive show, it feels like one that ended prematurely, with plotlines such as Mikasa's background being shoehorned in near the end. Still, the character designs portray the weight of time and trauma upon the characters, with dark resting expressions accentuated by additional linework.\n\n\n\n*Shingeki no Kyojin* never fails to engage with its action-packed fight scenes or jaw-dropping reveals. Fans of the series will continue to enjoy it, and anime enthusiasts can revel in a storytelling experience which few shows can match.  It is a worthy inclusion amongst this year's best, earning it eighth place.",

          "writeup": "*Odd Taxi* provides a unique and distinctive experience that captivated audiences and stakes its claim as a contender in the 2021 anime landscape. The show features a tight narrative that weaves together many characters and storylines seamlessly. \n\n\n\n*Odd Taxi* shines with its varied and strong cast, each with compelling backgrounds and characterization that makes them charming to watch. Their interesting personalities combined with their realistic and uncovered issues makes for an appealing ensemble. Every character has their own role in the story, creating a large and balanced cast that has few weak points.\n\n\n\nWhile *Odd Taxi* excels in some areas, there are limitations to the work. Despite the compelling cast, many of the characters are tied to Odakawa's presence. While the show has a distinct visual style, its animation sometimes fail to provide as vivid a viewing experience as other entries from this year.\n\n\n\nThat said, *Odd Taxi* provides a unique and charming experience that makes it one of the top shows of the year. The script stands out as top notch. There is no time wasted and every detail ends up being important in the long run, rewarding the viewer for paying close attention and setting up a story that fits like a puzzle. These details create a satisfying sense of mystery for all viewers.",

          "writeup": "Despite the controversy around it, *Mushoku Tensei* excels in several areas. The visuals are stunning, showcasing high-energy, well-choreographed fight animation that is incredible to watch. Its unique approach to opening sequences is noteworthy as well, utilizing them to explore each region and elevate the already strong world-building and story. This alternate reality of sword and sorcery may seem complex, but the narrative is cohesive and well-paced, providing numerous opportunities for characters to grow and their voice actors to shine.\n\n\n\nHowever, opportunity alone is not enough. *Mushoku Tensei* is a character study about Rudeus Greyrat, his initial flaws and his prospective growth, and the writing tries to balance between “absolute scum” and “someone the audience can cheer for”—Rudy leans too heavily into the former category. Despite developing in some ways, his treatment of women is consistently awful, and the tendency of other characters to turn a blind eye to his antics is awkward and off-putting, dragging them down with him. This massive flaw remaining unaddressed after 25 episodes is a massive detriment; Rudy comes across as too perverse to be redeemed. \n\n\n\nThe fact that *Mushoku Tensei* manages to accomplish so much despite this handicap is impressive. It's easy to see why the show is so beloved, and the energy put into the production is apparent. As that kind of passion is used to bring such a fascinating world to life, it's no wonder the series comes in at a well-deserved ninth place on the ranking for Anime of the Year.",
