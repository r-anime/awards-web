            "answer": "Darth Vader is one of the best villains in cinema history. He's extremely menacing-looking and just steals the show whenever he's on screen. I also think the twist of him being Luke's father is great because it adds depth to his characterization.\r\n\r\nOn visual production, he has black armor and a red lightsaber which is super badass and makes him look evil. The voice modulation of his voice also gives him a robotic feel so you think he's a robot but actually he's human all along.\r\n\r\n**Grade:**\r\n\r\nVisual Production: 1\r\n\r\nVoice Acting: 1\r\n\r\nCharacter: 1 \r\n\r\n**Comment:** The description of the character is basic and has zero argumentation.

            "question": "Choose a character you enjoy. Examine and analyze why you enjoy them.",
            "answer": "Darth Vader in the original Star Wars trilogy represents to me the apex of how you represent a villain stylistically. On the surface he's quite simple: A black outfit, a bellowing cape, a big scary helmet. And the outward purpose of this is clear: Every time Vader is on screen he becomes the focus of the scene. He is terrifying, deadly, and authoritative. In many cases, much more so than the Emperor. Similarly, his voice presents him as an unfeeling robot, unable to even *sound* human let alone look like one. Coupled with the fact that practically no one has seen him without armor, this gives off the idea that he might not be human at all.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is turned on its head at two points: When he reveals that he is Luke's father and when he takes his helmet off. The former tells us directly, clearly, that this man was a human that once loved someone enough to father a child with them. And that his attachment to this child is not entirely gone as he tries to bring Luke over to this side. Luke of course violently rejects this, mirroring the viewer's reaction. He's a villain, a bad guy, he shouldn't have any emotions. Nevertheless, he's still presented in quite an evil way on the reveal, so perhaps his character has gone from \"unfeeling robot\" to \"evil man\" in the viewer's eyes.\r\n\r\nThen comes his death scene, and his entire character is presented in a new light: His menacing helm and his robotic voice is not because \"he's just evil\", but rather a breathing mask and a modulator to preserve the life of a broken man. Coupled with the fact that he betrayed the Emperor in the end, this may reveal the truth of his character: Simply a crippled individual whose life-saving technology was angled and portrayed as powerful and menacing by his master, presenting the idea that Vader, in the right hands, maybe could have been good all along and that his outward appearances are not intrinsic to his character but due to outside manipulation.\r\n\r\n**Grade:** \r\n\r\nVisual Production: 2\r\n\r\nVoice Acting: 1\r\n\r\nCharacter: 2\r\n\r\n**Comment:** The character-aspect is fine and includes examples, but the answer lacks any deeper analysis to elevate it to a 3.There is a lot of summary without much accompanying said summary. On the voice acting angle, there is basically nothing, yielding a 1. The visual production and overall answer is stronger but needs less summary and more pinpointed analysis to truly be special."

            "question": "Choose a character you enjoy. Examine and analyze why you enjoy them.",
            "answer": "If I had to name one character I enjoyed from all the things that I have watched, Darth Vader from Star Wars would be the first to come to mind. \r\n\r\nThe character Darth Vader and his development is what the whole original trilogy is basically about. In the first movie, he was the ruthless and evil antagonist. His pure strength was shown early when he choked Captain Antilles. But his true strength was shown later. Later, we saw him force choke a high ranking imperial officer. He was ruthless to those who stood in his way, even if they were in his own faction. Choking imperial officers was a regular sight in the trilogy, underlining his ambition.\r\n\r\nIn Episode 5 we learned more about his character than him being just an evil villain. We learned that he actually had a son. Suddenly he was also the father of our hero. This was the setup for his inner conflict in Episode 6, being torn between his son who believes in the good in him and the emperor. Obi-Wan Kenobi said to Luke “He is more machine now than man, twisted and evil”. At the same time, we learned that he had an actual name: “Anakin Skywalker”. Through that we saw him as a bit more human. The final part of the trilogy was all about this inner conflict. His mind was completely set on Luke and not the bigger picture. But he still had to obey the emperor. Suddenly the ruthless and ambitious villain became a pawn. Luke's constant refusal to fight him and also seeing the emperor frying Luke was the high point of his conflict. Luke gave Vader something that no one else had in decades: Love. Despite his evil deeds, Luke protected Vader. Luke’s sacrifice was the breaking point for him, as he not only saved his son, but also killed the emperor in the process, which turned him from a villain to a hero.\r\n  \r\nWhat also makes Darth Vader interesting is his Character Design. Until the final movie he was completely masked for most of the time. This way there was no face that could show any emotion, we were left in the dark trying to figure out what he was thinking. The best example for this would be in Episode 5 right at the end, after Vader was confident that the Millenium Falcon would not get away. After they did the unexpected jump to lightspeed, he just stood on the bridge for a few moments. But we could not see what was going through his mind. The mask made him unpredictable. How his face looked was a mystery, as we only got a glimpse of what is beneath the mask in Episode 5. Next to the mask there was one other thing that makes his character more than iconic. The constant, monotone breathing. That was the big indication that Vader is indeed human. It was also an important part for his presence, as wherever he was, his breathing was dominant and added a certain chill to the atmosphere. There was no change in it that would give away any emotions. The only time it changed was when Luke beat Vader in his final battle against him. After damaging his suit, his breathing cracked and made him sound like a wounded beast. In contrast to his cut off hand that showed only wires, his cracked breathing was still hinting at his human part. His breathing was what made him so memorable, as you can recognize it in an instant. This immense amount of presence given to just the act of breathing made him an incredibly powerful character.\r\n\r\nBeing completely masked it all comes down to the voice to leave an impression. David Prowe’s voice was not fitting for the character. Instead they cast James Earl Jones to do the voiceover for Vader. Jones' voice delivered the deep and dark tone that was required. Usually he was showing very little emotion in his voice, which enhanced the character of Darth Vader because he will not give away any potential weakness. A prime example for Jones’ work as Vader would be the following scene: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnNSnJbjdws. Jones gave Vader a small portion of confidence delivering his lines. The way he dragged out the word “insignificant” and emphasised his voice on ”the power of the force” was clarifying to the viewer that he was the most dangerous being in the universe. There was also one example in which Vader was angry enough for Jones to put in more emotion: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JygtTPaPVX0. He raised his voice way more than usual. Hearing Vader almost shouting “bring me the passengers, I want them alive” instantly set him as the villain he aimed to be. One last example for Jones' performance would be this scene: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waHFQ58M2VE. Note how he delivered “You don’t know the power of the dark side, I must obey my master” Jones put so much emphasis on the word “must”. It did hint on the conflict that was going on inside him. If you listen closely to “If that is your destiny”, you can hear it was a bit more quiet, as Vader would actually regret it if he had to kill Luke. Jones had the task to transmit Vader’s emotions through a more monotone voice and those little volume adjustments were what made it so remarkable. \r\n\r\n**Grade:** \r\n\r\nVisual Production: 3\r\n\r\nVoice Acting: 4\r\n\r\nCharacter: 3\r\n\r\n**Comment:** A very solid overall answer. What sets this apart from a 2 is the strong usage of examples, particularly towards the voice acting aspect. The individual analysis of his character design and voice acting is particularly strong, which improves the overall grade, although there is still a lack of any *fantastic* analysis to bring the character grade to a 4."

            "answer": "Between Mukougaoka Chisato wa Tada Mitsumeteita no Datta and Airy Me, my favorite of the two was Airy Me. Airy Me has a more distinct aesthetic, using only a few colors. It’s also the better animated of the two, highlighted best with the scene in the hallway. The patient transforms into an amorphous monster and the visuals for this part are phenomenal, the design morphs around with tremendous speed and moves in completely unnatural ways, changing size and shape at a whim. From the visuals alone you can see the complete loss of humanity, even down to the movement. However, Chisato has an easier to understand narrative which I liked, a girl reminiscing on the days gone past and wishing to go and do it all again. Airy Me is a lot more cryptic, a patient seems to transform into a monster and it’s hard to gain any meaningful context about how that happens, even the result is hard to understand. The story of Chisato connected with me a bit more. Chisato also made me laugh at the part where the main character bumps her head in a rock, playing that animation multiple times really added to the effect. I didn’t really enjoy the music of either music video on their own terms but they work well for telling the story, there are even breaks in the music for dramatic effect in Chisato which added to the storytelling. An example of this at play is how in the scenes at the hospital, the music simply drops out entirely and is replaced with more ambient noise, taking the audience of the dreamlike world the music was painting just before and just after, selling the idea of this being either happy memories of time gone by or wishes for a better reality. There is a long pause in the music towards the end, before it comes back echoing the same melody from the beginning but unlike in the beginning, the music is now swelling towards a big emotional climax, which I interpreted to be their resolve to live in that dreamlike world. Regardless of the actual intent, the music definitely builds intrigue and lets you imagine a story from just the way it’s structured, pairing very well with the visuals. In contrast, the music for Airy Me is a lot more one-note, it’s very sad and reflective, without particular changes in tone. Even when the animation ramps up there isn’t much of a change in the visuals. I think Chisato’s use of the music for story telling was more impressive to me than the more tonally stagnant use of music in Airy Me. Overall, I liked Airy Me more but both music videos were good with their own strengths. \r\n\r\n**Grade:** \r\n\r\nVisual Production: 2\r\n\r\nGenre: 2\r\n\r\nOPED: 2\r\n\r\n**Comment:** The visual production aspect is a bit thin but it’s definitely there and does the job. The overall answer is alright, although there is very little analysis of Airy Me. The analysis of Chisato is good, but the lack of anything about Airy Me drags it down a lot."

            "answer": "*Chisato Stared* and *Airy Me* both stand out with strong and unique visual styles that make an immediate impact, along with engaging narratives and themes. Despite the proficiency of both MVs, *Airy Me*’s intricate character and background animation put it ahead of *Chisato Stared*, which has plenty of visual strengths in its own right. \r\n\r\n*Chisato Stared* makes excellent use of color, depicting a monotone world and selectively inserting blasts of vibrant color to create contrast and mirror the emotional tone of each scene. This approach is highlighted in the final act of the MV, where the main character’s hair bursts into a brilliant orange color, popping off the screen more than anything else so far. This moment is where the character breaks free and acts as their own person. This is a distinct contrast to the character’s muted colors as she was previously dragged through the monotonous world. The shift in color is a simple yet effective tool that drives home the main themes and builds emotional catharsis. In comparison, *Airy Me* takes a much more subdued approach to color. It leans even more heavily into monotone coloring, but doesn’t rely on color to heighten its emotional climaxes. Instead, color is used to highlight the unnaturalness of certain objects such as the rabbit, or more broadly to change the mood—done by adjusting the visual tone of the scene entirely. While effective, it doesn’t create nearly the impression or emotional impact as the color in *Chisato Stared*.\r\n\r\n*Airy Me* does, however, make a statement with its animation. The combination of tender character animation, unsettlingly psychedelic transformation sequences, and the use of a constantly shifting perspective put it head and shoulders over *Chisto Stared* in this regard, which takes an approach to its animation similar to its use of color. Overall it is much more restrained than *Airy Me*, with a flatter visual style overall and mostly focusing on intensely sporadic character animation. The highlight in this regard is the movement of the main character. She is constantly whipped around, stretching with almost no regard to anatomical accuracy. Its strength in design shows here as she always remains recognizable despite the wild animation, and it comes together to depict the character’s mental state beautifully. *Airy Me*’s character animation is more focused on realism to the point where it is unsettling. The large, bug-like eyes of the nurse seem especially unnatural compared to the rest of her unassuming design and perfectly human movements. When she grabs the patient's arm, the indentations she creates immediately signal how weak the patient is. In contrast to this approach, the MV later breaks out into an unnerving transformation sequence where it takes the anatomical realism established previously and turns it on its head. As the patient smoothly flows into a grotesque monster we see his spine, muscles, and skeleton transform from convincingly real human into the ever changing mass of the creature. The MV then again relies on the contrast of realism, depicting the patient waking up with more detail and shading than anything else so far, telegraphing that this may be the true reality of the film. *Airy Me*’s most impressive animation technique is how it constantly moves the perspective angle throughout nearly the entire runtime. This creates an immersive sense of depth and space for the setting. Characters and objects consistently stay on model despite being depicted from different angles constantly. The chase scenes in particular benefit from this approach, with plants and pillars flying across the screen, establishing the depth and distance to make the chase truly gripping.\r\n\r\nMusically, *Chisato Stared* follows a similar approach to the other elements of the MV. It starts off with a chaotic layering of keyboard, drums, bass, and guitar that gradually rises in volume before getting cut off as the main character ends up in the hospital. The music returns later, and serves as a mirror to the character's mental state. Throughout the midsection, the guitar is much more subdued, but eventually breaks out at the end, once again creating the chaotic and unrestrained sound as the character has finally freed themselves. While effective, the approach is quite simple. *Airy Me*’s unsettling dream-pop song makes an immediate impression with its haunting vocals and extremely reverbative guitars combining to establish the eerie mood that lingers through the entire MV. After the introduction, the repetition of the strong keyboard and drum tracks create a backbone that mirrors the seeming monotony of the tasks depictive visually. This normality is broken by the beautiful vocals that cut through the track and the unnatural sound effects that pop up in the background. This builds until the climax, where the repetition fades away and all that is left is an atmospheric keyboard track and the vocals, which are now more welcoming than haunting.\r\n\r\n**Grade:** \r\n\r\nVisual Production: 4\r\n\r\nGenre: 4\r\n\r\nOPED: 3\r\n\r\n**Comment:** Very strong answer in practically all aspects. Good introduction section and focus on colors between the two MVs (with examples). The animation analysis is great and also contains lots of good examples and direct contrasts. The music section is concise and to the point, showing the difference in tone of the two MVs. An overall gold star answer."

The violin country represents classical music, and it’s filled with prudes who stick to a strict beat. Meanwhile the jazz country is freeform and fun. The saxophone kid (prince I guess?) falls in love with the violin princess and he goes to get her, but comes on too hard and kinda scares her off. Then he ends up in jail, something Sax Daddy ain’t having. They go to wore to save sax prince and the islands turn into awesome battle ships that shoot at each other with instruments. Violin princess goes out to see on a boat with a white flag to save the day by making pease, but she gets blasted. Before she can drown tho, sax boi saves the day, kind of like in Titanic, after he was freed from prison by the bombardment of the classical island, and he sales to save his special lady. He ends up sinking too though, barely in time to save her life. The violin queen and sax king go to retrieve their kids, and what do you know, they fall in love too. It’s a happy wedding ending for both couples, and happily ever after. A show of what Disney used to be before they kept making stupid super hero movies and trash CGI or whatever that latest Lion King was. I sure miss the old Disney.

            "answer": "Music Land is a short about warring islands, each themed after different styles of music. It sets up the difference in music styles early on, the Land of Symphony clearly being melodic and metered classical music, and the Land of Jazz being raucous and discordant jazz music. Most people in each land are content with the way things are, but the young violin and saxophone of each royal family sneak away, tired of the same old same old. They see each other, and instantly form an attraction. Then war breaks out over the capture of the jazz prince, and the violin princess tries to make peace. Eventually she is sunk, and the sax prince goes to save her. He then sinks, the parents come to save the day. They fall in love too, and it’s happily ever after.\r\n\r\nThe best part of this piece is definitely the music. I love how it contrasts the two styles. It shows a clear difference between the two, using the difference in genre to create cultural differences between the two nations. It’s some expert worldbuilding which I love. For the most part, the two musical styles stay separate, up until the end of the short, where we see the musical styles literally married.\r\n\r\nThe visuals are also great. I love old school animation like this. The action of the cannons firing and the explosions in the background and the waves crashing around fiercely make the scene intense, as we hope for our main characters to make it out alive. The designs of the instruments are genius too. The saxophones have little caps in their bells which make it look like they’re wearing hats like a jazz musician would wear. The violins have the string tighteners on the sides and at the ends of their bridges the wood is curled, coming together to look like a Victorian hairstyle. It shows a clear difference between the uptight and organized Land of Symphony and the chaotic and freeform Land of Jazz, even from the designs.\r\n\r\n**Grade:** \r\n\r\nVisual Production: 2\r\n\r\nOST: 1\r\n\r\nGenre: 2\r\n\r\nCharacter: 2\r\n\r\n**Comment:** The answer spends a bit long on summary at the start, only getting into analysis in the second paragraph. The audio analysis says that is shows a “clear difference” between the two but fails to say *what* the difference is. The visual analysis is fine, the strongest point being the character design discussion, but it’s very surface-level. A better use of examples would also help a lot. Overall this is acceptable, but needs either stronger audio, visual, or literary analysis to truly shine."

            "answer": "As the title suggests, music is deeply intertwined into every aspect of *Music Land*. The musical motif spans from the setting to the characters, with music even standing in for dialogue. The film tells a simple tale of star crossed lovers and the characters fill their roles well. Without dialogue and only a nine minute runtime, the characters gain what personality and depth they have through their audiovisual presentation. In every regard the cast manages to find a great balance between technical accuracy of the instruments and exaggerated personification. The instruments each character is based on are unmistakable, and this realism is balanced out by the subtle yet impactful features added when giving the characters human-like features. The prince alto sax's prominent round nose and cheeks perfectly capture the bubbly nature of the character, easily connecting him to the jazz stereotype the film is leaning into. Conversely, the queen cello immediately screams 'uptight' with her long upturned nose, constant frown, and frilly collar that comes right up to her chin. A perfectly respectable queen befitting the realm of classical music.\r\n\r\nThis dichotomy between jazz and classical music fuels the entire film. The simple story functions as a vehicle to explore the visual and aural ideas that arise in this stylistic conflict. At every turn a new idea is used, whether it be a character using a metronome for a boat engine or literal music notes being used as weapons. When the alto sax writes a note, he writes sheet music. When the baritone sax is enjoying the guitar lady entertaining him, he plucks her 'strings'. Small details such as these build on one another to create a fleshed out world. As mentioned earlier, music stands in for dialogue throughout the film, and each character's 'voice' enhances their personality. The alto sax's awkward, not-quite tuned bursts of sound help to paint his bumbling yet determined image, while the light, feathery notes of the violin's giggles capture her dainty character.\r\n\r\nThe conflict between two musical styles comes to a peak during the artillery battle between the two kingdoms. An artillery made of a full jazz band launches notes of a rousing hot jazz tune from the Isle of Jazz towards the Land of Symphony, who respond with waves of angry refrains of \"Ride of the Valkyries.\" At first, each piece is perfectly emblematic of their respective musical genres clashing with one another. However as the battle rages on, the music of both sides seem to merge together into a single paradoxical piece: chaotic and cohesive, frenzied and friendly. Ultimately *Music Land* is about finding harmony, and we see the characters come together in the finale in multiple ways by the short's finale. Emotionally with the pair of marriages. Physically with the new Bridge of Harmony connecting the two nations. And musically, as a joyful song of celebration combining both styles plays over the ending scene.\r\n\r\n**Grade:** \r\n\r\nVisual Production: 3\r\n\r\nOST: 3\r\n\r\nGenre:3 \r\n\r\nCharacter: 3 \r\n\r\n**Comment:** There is immediately solid character design analysis, with some further mention of other small visual quirks. The “voice acting” of the two main characters is also discussed, and both the charades and OST contains examples. While there is nothing truly fantastic about this application, it answers the question, provides examples, and ends with a neat little conclusion of how it all comes together."
