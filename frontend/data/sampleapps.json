            "answer": "I really like both *The Arrival* and *District 9*. They are both about aliens but very different. *District 9* is about a giant spaceship that appears over a city where humans find a bunch of aliens inside and decide to put them in a camp called District 9 which then turns into a ghetto. Everyone is racist towards the aliens. Then comes a man called Wikus who gets sprayed by alien goo which an alien tried to use for a secret plan. This goo turns Wikus into an alien which he tries to hide and gets chased by the army. They then tell the public that has a dangerous disease so everyone tries to hunt him too. He then flees to District 9 and meets the alien who made the goo. The alien tells Wikus to find some weapons to break in to the alien ship and fly away. They have a big battle with the army guys and finally gets the alien goo so they can escape on the ship. The alien promises Wikus to return in 3 years to cure his disease and we end on a cliffhanger.\r\n\r\n Meanwhile *The Arrival* is about some spaceships that come down all over earth with creepy tentacle monsters inside. The MC tries to communicate with them using a weird circle language and think they are trying to give the humans weapons. China thinks it’s dangerous but the MC thinks that they’re giving humans tools instead. Things escalate and world wants the aliens to leave because they think they’re dangerous. They learn that the weapon/tool is actually the language itself which can do time travel and the MC has had weird time travel visions all the time. She uses these visions to stop China and writes a book on the language.\r\n\r\nBoth are really good movies but I think *The Arrival* is much better and cooler and also has a better story. I like the action scenes in District 9 though.\r\n\r\n**Grade:** 1/4\r\n\r\n**Comments:** Entirely summary with zero analysis or discussion of the show."

            "answer": "Two movies that are both about alien “invasions” are *The Arrival* and *District 9* but they are very different. In both of them the aliens don’t try to invade but rather try to talk with humans or get help. *The Arrival* is in my opinion the better of the two as the aliens look much more alien and have cooler visuals. The massive stone-like spaceships and tentacled creatures give a much more alien vibe that portrays them as foreign and different, contrasting their humanitarian nature. The movie also focuses more on the mystery of who they are and what they want, which works very well with a language-focused movie as learning to communicate can also be seen as a mystery.\r\n\r\n*District 9* is not as interesting but it’s a lot more personal since the main character gets transformed into an alien as well. This makes him realize that the aliens are also people. But the fact that they look so human kinda takes it away. You could argue that the human look of the aliens work better in terms of the racism aspect, but for me it takes away what the show is trying to portray. They should have looked more alien to better sell that “they’re not like us but still like us” vibe it tries to give. I also think *District 9* had better action scenes and was more thriller-y, which kept you more at the edge of your seat. However the message just being “don’t judge people on appearances” is not really as cool as what it could have been.\r\n\r\n**Grade:** 2/4\r\n\r\n**Comments:** Makes some points and tries to engage with both works, but the analysis falls a bit short and ends up being fairly surface-y. One or two examples could also help."

            "question": "Pick two anime with a similar theme or concept, one you like and one you love. Analyze what aspects each anime does better than the other.",
            "answer": "*The Arrival* and *District 9* are both movies that twist the typical “alien invasion” trope, opting instead for the aliens to guide or seek help from the people of Earth respectively. However, their focus within this concept is wholly different.\r\n\r\nBoth films deal with the cultural differences between humans and the aliens, but for *The Arrival* this is in prime focus. There is of course the whole timey-wimey aspect of a language that transcends time, but I want to focus on how it portrays an alien species so completely foreign to humanity and the latters attempt to communicate with the former. By portraying the aliens as tentacled lovecraftian creatures, it sets off the audience’s immediate instinct of them being evil, foreign, and monstrous. However, the main characters still attempt to understand these creatures despite attempts from the outside to simply destroy the spaceships. By introducing us to the aliens’ extremely complex and beautiful language, we see them in a new light. Not only are they receptive to our attempts to communicate, the fact that they have a language we can recognise bridge the gap between thinking of them as monsters and thinking of them as people. Throughout history it is a common belief that “barbarous” and foreign tribes have a similarly barbarous language. The intentional depiction of the aliens’ language as much more complex than ours informs the viewers against this initial dismissal of their culture as barbaric. After all, the way people communicate says a lot about our culture.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, *District 9* has a much more personal focus. Rather than dealing with the alien language and culture as a larger concept, it instead focuses on singular characters, namely Wikus and Johnson and the general treatment of refugees and foreigners in the apartheid era. Much more direct and to-the-point, *District 9* looks at the relationship between Wikus and the aliens in a very personal manner. Wikus’ later transformation into a “prawn” highlights that the outer shell of a person should be irrelevant to their stature as a person, but is obviously not. One of the most clear examples of dehumanization is when he’s forced to eat cat food, something he previously thought nothing of as the aliens ate it since they were obviously not human and therefore effectively animals.\r\n\r\nAt the focus of both movies, although more overtly in *District 9*, is the message that the aliens are not so different from humans, and that different human races are thus even less different. *The Arrival* does it by using the language of the aliens to broker peace: Communication between cultures is the key. Language is the bond that binds civilizations. By accepting and learning the language of another culture we can further get to know that culture in its entirety and through that combat xenophobia. It is this direct focus on language as the primary cornerstone of culture that I believe *The Arrival* does much better than *District 9*, as well as the general better portrayal of a truly alien people. *District 9* effectively uses the aliens as a stand-in for black people during the apartheid but does not go further into exploring the alien culture. However it does manage to make the aliens more personal and its strong character focus helps it give the viewer a stronger emotional attachment to the aliens whereas *The Arrival* is fairly distant in that emotional investment where it concerns the aliens directly.\r\n\r\n**Grade:** 3/4\r\n\r\n**Comments:** A strong analysis that engages with the themes of both works and properly compares what each movie does well. The conclusion is a bit vague and with only a few examples, the write-up isn’t good enough for a 4/4, but still a solid answer."

            "answer": "Randy “The Ram” Robinson from “The Wrestler” portrays possibly one of the greatest thematic portrayals of a wrestling star’s descent to obscurity and his inability to move on.  From the very start of the film, audio clips and newspaper articles are shown to demonstrate just how much of a big deal Randy was at one point. Only to show 20 years later, he’s changing in what appears to be a children’s classroom for a small pay day.  A star past their prime whose name is used to help sell tickets for fans who remember them.\r\n\r\nIn the film, it goes to great lengths to demonstrate how different being around wrestlers and fans and inside the ring is to his day-to-day life.  The manager of his side job ridicules him, his landlord locks him out and his daughter wants nothing to do with him anymore.  In the face of this he keeps going until life deals him a near death heart attack following a particularly rough match.  This forces him to confront life after the ring after more than 20 years of it.\r\n\r\nHe slowly starts to make a life, he takes on more hours working in the deli at his local grocery store, he makes attempts to reconcile with his daughter and life legitimately starts to look up.  However, he can’t get his old stardom out of his head, he hears the cheers as he walks through imaginary curtains. One visit to a local wrestling show and he immediately falls back to old habits.  The bright outlook he had shatters completely when a fan recognizes him on a particularly frustrating day at his side job.  He decides there’s only one thing he can do right. Wrestle.\r\n\r\n**Grade:** 1/4\r\n\r\n**Comments:** There are ideas here, but it focus more on providing a summary of the character and the film than providing analysis."

            "answer": "Randy “The Ram” Robinson from “The Wrestler” portrays a great thematic portrayal of someone who lives in two different worlds.  The one where he is loved and the one where he’s just another person living their life.  Worlds of difference face “The Ram”  who is beloved by fans and Robin Ramzinski, the aging man working odd jobs and struggling to pay his rent. When given the opportunity to escape and live a quiet life, he faces the difficult choice to face reality or live in the limelight until the end.\r\n\r\nThe movie goes to great lengths to showcase just how different Randy’s life is when he’s not in the ring.  The start of the movie showcases audio clips and newspaper cut outs of his successful career in the 80s, to include a comment of how he sold out “The Garden” which is one of the most respected venues in the wrestling industry.  Then it cuts to him changing after a show in what appears to be a elementary school classroom and being handed a small envelope of money from an apologetic promoter.  Following this, he comes home to find he’s been locked out and his landlord refusing to open the door in the dead of night.  In an effort to get more money, he requests additional shifts at his side job, where he’s mocked by a grocery store manager.  No respect, no adulation, just cold reality in a world that doesn’t owe him anything.\r\n\r\nYet this is immediately juxtaposed when he shows up to the venue for his next match. Wrestlers of all ages greet him and show him great respect. A rising star who is his opponent asks him if he’s cool with how the match will go and earnestly listens to his advise and encouragement.  He goes out of the match and the fans are screaming his name and eating out the palm of his hand.  Not one of these fans or possibly even the wrestlers would suspect that The Ram is living paycheck to paycheck and disrespected outside of wrestling.\r\n\r\nThis comes to a head when following a brutal hardcore match where his body is left bloody and bruised, he collapses from a heart attack.  When he wakes up, the doctor begins to explain what he needs to do to stay healthy and get better, ultimately stating that Randy shouldn’t continue to wrestle.\r\n\r\nThe very idea of no longer being a wrestler has never occurred to him.  His entire life is his wrestling, in real life he corrects anyone who calls him “Robin” or “Mr. Ramzinski” because to him, he’s just Randy.  He’s the wrestler who sold out the Garden.  Despite his hardships from no longer being a top star, he can’t see himself living any other way. Reality is harsh though, and he’s pushed to come to terms with reality when shortly after starting to go for a job, he finds himself unable to keep running, even having to sit down as he breathes heavily from something he could previously do without concern.  This pushes him to start looking at what comes next. He attempts to reconcile with his estranged family, he tells promoters he’s retiring and he begins to work full time at the local grocery store working the cashier at the deli.  He’s crossed back over to being Mr. Ramzinski and life starts to really look up.\r\n\r\nHowever, life isn’t the ideal world that it is for him when he’s Randy Robinson.  Following a rejection from Cassidy, Randy gets drunk and visits a local wrestling show.  Following the event, some wrestlers who grew up idolizing him offer to take him out for some drinks and he falls back into his old habits. He brags about his exploits that lead to him missing a reserved dinner with his daughter which just reminds her that he’s always failed to make time for her. All of this finally comes to a close when he’s having a rough day at the Deli and a customer recognizes that he’s The Ram, although he denies this. “Oh that’s weird, you look just like him, but older.” Randy snaps. He doesn’t want to live the life where he’s just another person, where his daughter doesn’t love him, where his boss and peers don’t respect him.  He calls up a promoter and says he’s back to wrestling, even offering to do an event he canceled for free. He just wants the rush of being back in the Ring.\r\n\r\nYet despite this escalation of events, he’s still given one final opportunity to see that he  can have something outside of wrestling.  Cassidy quits her job and rushes to the show to try and stop him.  It’s too late though.  Just as he arrived he’s treated with respect again by the fellow workers.  He’s all prepared for another big match.  As she makes final pleas his theme music plays and he can only respond “This is where I belong”.  He’s decided to live his life as a wrestler to the end rather than live life safely in spite of his heart problems.\r\n\r\nRandy was stuck between two worlds, and ultimately failed to come to the side of reality.\r\n\r\n**Grade:** 2/4\r\n\r\n**Comments:** Makes points towards the character’s narrative focus, but fails to fully expand on ideas. Not all examples are clearly explained and a large portion of the submission is summary and rambly.  A bit more focus on the points being made could have pushed it to a 3."

            "answer": "A character focused drama, 'The Wrestler' explores its themes of coping with aging and destructive nostalgia through its main character, Randy 'The Ram' Robinson. Robinson is an aging professional wrestler whose successful career has fallen to a breaking point.  His body is falling apart, he relies heavily on drugs and he does it all for small independent performances that don’t even cover his rent. Yet despite these challenges, he continues to wrestle as if he’s still a successful headlining act.\r\n\r\nHis ego and pride are stuck in a time long gone, it’s the reality of everything he cares about. One of the better scenes that puts this in perspective is a short scene with a kid from his neighborhood. Randy invites him to play “Nintendo”.  While playing an old SNES pro wrestling game, the youngster looks a bit bored, and starts to bring up a more modern game “Call of Duty 4”.  Unsurprisingly the Randy doesn’t know what that is, nor does he really engage with the kid on the topic.The Ram is a man who is obsessed with a time when he was a star. At the start of the film the opening credits play several audio clips and shows off an incredible display of newspaper articles showering him with praise.  The reality is though that he’s not that star anymore. As mentioned his body is in tatters, and this comes to head when he competes in a bloody and brutal death match. Following the match he’s out of it while the movie highlights the wounds he’s sustained and the actions that caused them. As he gets up to leave, he stumbles to the lockers before collapsing with a heart attack.\r\n\r\n“Doc I’m a professional wrestler.”\r\n\r\n“That’s not a good idea.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?”\r\n\r\nConfronted with this near death experience, the doctor tells him that his time as a professional wrestler must come to an end.  The stress of the profession will be too much for his heart.  This of course isn’t what Randy wants to hear. He’s forced to take it to heart however as a light jog leaves him heavily gasping for air and collapsing in the woods near his home.  Capitalizing on this reality is the sight of his fellow legends at a signing event. Many of his old friends are in wheelchairs, passing out in public and just clear shells of their former selves. This is the first time that Robin Ramzinski appears to really think about his future.  Does he want to keep ushing himself until he’s like the other aging performers around him?\r\n\r\nHowever time doesn’t only impact one person, it comes for in many forms. This is shown as he attempts to reconcile with his daughter, Stephanie, who he neglected. During a walk he even admits to at one point trying to pretend that she didn’t exist. His life in the limelight led him away and he failed her. It takes multiple attempts to get this point however, as Stephanie makes it clear she doesn’t want to talk to him the first time he reaches out. Because the first conversation he’d had in years was to tell her about his heart attack.\r\n\r\nRandy doesn’t see why she’s upset, yet he’s the man who throughout her childhood was never there. Missed every birthday, and now that she’s in college and getting through her life, and her dad’s first conversation with her is to say that he nearly died. What was she supposed to say? Time didn’t stop for her, but it had for him. So when they finally begin to talk in earnest he breaks down from this reality.In the leadup to the finale of the film, Randy is starting to really earnestly enjoy life. He’s got a bit of a budding relationship with Cassidy, a stripper he frequents and routinely vents to. He’s talking to his daughter again, and he’s making a decent living behind a deli counter. However old habits don’t die easily. He stumbles, a rejection leads him to a night out like the old days which leads into him missing a dinner with his daughter that ultimately ruins any chance of a long term relationship being restored. And finally he hits his breaking point.\r\n\r\nAfter a very public freak-out as he quits his job at the deli he called to say he wants back to the ring. As he’s about to make his way to the ring Cassidy confronts him. Someone who had rejected him in the leadup to this decision, and he has a short meaningful statement that mark his last words to her in the film.\r\n\r\n“The only place I get hurt is out there.  The world don’t give a shit about me.”\r\n\r\n  In spite of the risks, the pain and the reality of his future, he goes out to the roar of a crowd. To him the ring is real life, for just a short period of time, he can relive his stardom again. This is all what made him such an impactful character and really drove home a theme of aging and time.  He might not recover, but that’s the reality, not everyone is going to come to a “correct” answer. Some relationships aren’t meant to be reconciled. Some injuries can’t be overcome, but in the end time comes for us all.\r\n\r\n**Grade:** 3/4\r\n\r\n**Comments:** Strong analysis of the character’s involvement with the narrative theme of its work. Multiple cited examples supporting thesis. Very rambly and unorganized making its message less clear preventing it from being a 4."

            "answer": "Blackadder from “Blackadder Goes Forth” has some of the best comedic writing in the history of british sitcoms. I always laugh at how Blackadder insults the stupid Baldrick and George, who just constantly screw up his brilliant schemes to escape from the trenches. Blackadder is a genius manipulator who outwits both his superiors captain Darling and the incompetent and dumb general Melchett, who is just hell bent on sending poor Blackadder to die a stupid death. But thanks to Blackadder’s great intellect, he always escapes Melchett’s orders and Darlings meddling in his great schemes. Blackadder is not all smarts though, he can also be sympathetic to the dumb but naive George who has been fed propaganda by the evil british state and excitedly tries to get himself killed chasing glory and honor on the battlefield. Overall, Blackadder is one of my favorite comedic protagonists because he is very intelligent, has very funny insults for all the dumb idiots around him, but also has some heart for his common man that makes him sympathetic to me.\r\n\r\n**Grade:** 1/4\r\n\r\n**Comments:** This answer occasionally holds opinions, but utterly fails to make any analysis out of the summary it gives."

            "question": "Choose an anime character you enjoy and discuss the following: How they interact with three other characters in the same anime",
            "answer": "Captain Edmund Blackadder is one of my favorite comedic protagonists. A classic anti-hero, his shrewd cynicism contrasts with the attitudes of the rest of the cast to create great humor for the series. In particular i’ll be examining his interactions with his 2 subordinates - Private Baldrick and Lieutenant George, as well as his superior - General Melchett, all of whom are recurring characters in the greater Blackadder canon.\r\n\r\nPrivate Baldrick is the newest incarnation of Blackadder’s lowliest servant, still part of the great unwashed with a diet consisting of shit, dirt, and rats. Baldrick mostly gets bullied by Blackadder for his dumb peasant behavior and stupid plans, that ironically always start with Baldrick exclaiming he has a cunning plan. A constant pain in the ass, Baldrick being a necessary character for Blackadder to interact with is very funny, as his incompetence always ruins whatever plot Blackadder has cooked up to escape, either by just mixing up the orders, or taking them too literally.\r\n\r\nBlackadder has a fairly similar dynamic with his Lieutenant. While George was the capricious prince-regent Blackadder had to serve in the third series, in the 4th one their roles are reversed. George now serves under Blackadder, his naivete and optimism just as problematic as last series. But, just as often as creating problems, George’s naivete allows Blackadder to exploit George’s talents for his own goals, and as such, while Blackadder mostly complains about his partnership with George, he can’t help feeling somewhat sympathetic to the young soul sent to die on the battlefield.\r\n\r\nFinally there’s General Melchett. He’s just as dim-witted as George and Baldrick, but as Blackadder’s superior, Blackadder can never be candid with him, always answering him sarcastically or just straight up lying to Melchett. This stands in contrast to Melchett’s last appearance in the 2nd season, where they were on equal standing, both servants of the beheading-prone queenie Elizabeth I. Back then they both jostled for her favor between them, but now it is Blackadder jostling for Melchett’s favor, which is what most of his schemes are cooked up to do. In classic comedic fashion though, Blackadder’s schemes only ever delay his doom, as either George or Baldrick fumble some part of it so that he can never go home.\r\n\r\nOverall, Edmund Blackadder is a great comedic protagonist, whose cynicism and wit play well off of his supporting cast, lampooning their unfortunate situation. Blackadder manages to find comedy in some of the darkest british experiences, and that is why I love him.\r\n\r\n**Grade:** 2/4\r\n\r\n**Comments:** Strong analysis of the character’s involvement with the narrative theme of its work. Multiple cited examples supporting thesis. Very rambly and unorganized making its message less clear preventing it from being a 4."

            "question": "Choose an anime character you enjoy and discuss the following: How they interact with three other characters in the same anime",
            "answer": "One of my favorite characters is Edmund Blackadder, specifically Captain Edmund Blackadder from the 4th series of Blackadder, Blackadder Goes Forth. A shrewd but bitter and self-centered officer sitting in the trenches of the Great War, trying to get out of going over the top and charging over no man’s land for yet another slaughter of his men. \r\n\r\nIn classic sitcom tradition, Blackadder Goes Forth derives most of it’s humor form the caricatured character interactions, pitting the cynical Blackadder as the only sane man against the rest of the crazy cast. For example, Lieutenant George is a wide-eyed aristocrat whose inexperience and general lack of wit both create and resolve issues for Blackadder, such as George botching Blackadder’s defense at his court martial by immediately confirming that he saw Blackadder commit the crime, much to Blackadder’s dismay. However, George is just as often the lynchpin in Blackadder’s schemes, such as when trying to produce a good propaganda poster to get sent back as a propaganda artist. George turns out to be a great painter, and Blackadder immediately steals and presents George’s painting as his own. And yet, the ever-enthusiastic George still crawls out on the battlefield to paint enemy positions with Blackadder when this turns out to be a ruse, showing his loyalty to his Captain. These interactions slowly endear George to Blackadder, allowing the series to reflect on how propaganda drove impressionable young people to volunteer for war exploiting their admirable heroism and sense of duty, much like Blackadder himself ends up doing.\r\n\r\nAnother recurring character is the rube - Private Baldrick. As always, he mostly gets constant derision from Blackadder, either for his illiteracy like misreading “the Czar” as “bizarre”, or “cunning” plans like carving his own name on a bullet because its very unlikely for there to be 2 bullets with his name on it. Another standard interaction between Baldrick and Blackadder is the irony from Baldrick taking Blackadder’s orders too literally, such as denying everything, including being called Baldrick and being Blackadder’s batman when called to his defense in court. Where Baldrick gets his glow up compared to earlier series is in the setting of the trenches recontextualizing his filthy existence of eating dung and drinking hot mud as something not only undesirable but also resourceful and necessary, the black comedy involved being used by Blackadder to resolve his failing schemes a couple of times. Most notably when Baldrick’s cooking of rat au vin (a rat that’s been run over by a van) inspires Blackadder to sign the trio up to serve the fine cooking to their general - Melchett.\r\n\r\nGeneral Melchett plays the role of Blackadder’s petty and insufferable superior who sits 35 miles behind the front from where he jovially sends his soldiers to die for tiny scraps of land. Therefore most of their interactions are Blackadder sarcastically responding to all of Melchett’s ideas and plans that Melchett bulldozes onwards with anyways, such as Melchett’s brilliant plan to unexpectedly attack in the same charge that they’ve done the last 18 times. Melchett’s obliviousness to Blackadder’s sarcasm is also hilarious when Blackadder is the one suggesting ideas, such as Melchett enthusiastically noting down that the greatest way to improve the troops morale would be by Field Marshal Haig’s resignation and suicide. The tension between Blackadder’s prickly personality and Melchett’s playful attitudes are the setup to most schemes that Blackadder cooks up during the series, creating interactions like Blackadder having to lie through his teeth about loving Charlie Chaplin to please Melchett, seconds after ranting about how awful he is to George.\r\n\r\n**Grade:** 3/4\r\n\r\n**Comments:** Overall good answer, backs up almost all claims it makes with example skits from the series demonstrating solid engagement with the work. However the answer doesn’t tie the discussion of the 3 character interactions into any overarching thesis, failing to make truly insightful analysis of the series through its character interactions."

It sucks the scene is ruined afterwards when Ember remembers she has to run her dad's shop. The movie suddenly felt like it remembered it's on the 3rd act and needed to insert drama which undercut the impact and romance of their handhold scene.

Fire and water are incompatible but they made them compatible like that's so sweet.\r\n\r\n**Grade:** 1/4\r\n\r\n**Comments:** Gets off topic from describing why the scene is enhanced by its production and ends up critiquing it.

            "answer": "The best scene in Elemental is when Wade and Ember touch for the very first time. The cinematography and sound design during the scene is peak. The shallow depth of field and heavy amount of bokeh are reminiscent of classic k-drama confession scenes. Meanwhile, the sound design uses interesting inserts like a buzzing repellent sound when Ember first tries to touch Wade, and then a sizzling, boiling sound when they finally do touch each other. The characters don't talk to each other during this scene, which helps the viewer get more immersed into the romantic atmosphere. The music also isn't overpowering either, a light guitar and some quiet choir vocals chime in but there is no melodramatic insert song to distract from Wade and Ember's special moment. As the scene ends, the shot cuts to Wade's eyes and Ember's body is the light in his eyes. Considering he is water the way Ember's fire reflects off and shines through him helps represent how Wade sees Ember as aspirational. Ember however has difficulty accepting this about herself at this moment of the movie, but with time Wade helps her grow to love herself more and respect her own talent.\r\n\r\n**Grade:** 2/4\r\n\r\n**Comments:** Fairly close to a 3, just needs a bit more connecting tissue to how these help achieve the scene’s intended purpose.

            "answer": "Elemental's romance reaches its peak when Wade takes Ember to see Vivisteria flowers and both characters physically touch each other for the first time. What carries the magic of this scene strongest is the cinematography. At first, the journey through the flooded subway station towards the flowers is rather dull. The scenery is dark, murky, the characters express intrigue towards the abandoned structures but it isn't until they come across one of the Vivisteria flowers does that spark occur and the world around them lights up. The Vivisteria appear to be triggered by the glow of Ember's light and as she and Wade climb up the tree the flowers bloom and her light shines like a disco-ball. It's the happiest she appears in the movie. \r\n\r\nPrior to this scene, Ember returns to Wade a glass sculpture she made with an encased Vivisteria design, a representation of Ember's locked up talent and also past regrets. As Gale places Ember into an air bubble submarine to see the Vivisteria, Ember becomes a living embodiment of the sculpture she had returned to Wade. \r\n\r\nAs a viewer, one would expect this scene of seeing the flower tree to be the most visually impressive moment in the movie, but it's actually right after they see the Vivisteria where the movie climax occurs. With only twenty minutes of air Wade and Ember quickly exit the station right before Ember's air bubble pops, leaving her glass encased heart opened to lay bare her feelings to Wade. The background art inside the station was dreary and mysterious, but outside the lights of the glass buildings shine brightly. The colors are vivid and deeply saturated, with the blue and greens of Wade's water city contrasting Ember's glowing orange body. \r\n\r\nThe scene thus turns more romantic, with a shallow depth of field setting in and the soft bokeh of the city lights highlighting the characters emotions as they touch and slow dance for the first time. Meanwhile, the animation of the touch is exhilarating. Initially, there is this effect that is like a magnetic repulsion, and then Ember fights that buzzing instinct and holds Wade's hand. The shot cuts to a zoom in of her fire on top of his water, bubbles and steam form, their love is quite literally sizzling. The sound design also reflects this boiling, evaporating effect. Instead of having the characters talk over this scene, the music incorporates an airy guitar and quiet choir to enhance the magical atmosphere of this moment. The scene ends after Ember recalls her responsibilities towards her family, but that love still lingers both in Wade and her heart. The production of this scene, most importantly the cinematography but also the sound design solidifies to the audience the romantic connection both the characters have for each other and also Ember's own blooming development.\r\n\r\n**Grade:** 3/4\r\n\r\n**Comments:** Leans into summary a bit however manages to also go deeper into describing certain production elements. Adding in more connecting structure to the purpose would help raise the score to a 4."
