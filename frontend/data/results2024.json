Others discussion was all about the new hotness, like *Dandadan* or *Elusive Samurai*. We even got to head back to the 90's, before most of the jurors were born, to talk about *Kinnikuman* and *Slam Dunk*! Suffice to say, Action covered a lot of ground this year, with series new and old, dramatic or comedic. And while not everything discussed managed to get nominated, with series like *Wind Breaker*, *Bucchigiri* or *Soaring Sky! Precure* falling just short of earning a spot, we're confident these nominations are a strong reflection of 2024.",

With a wide variety of unique characters and gimmicks that elevate wrestling matches to death battles with the fate of the world at stake, *Kinnikuman* brings its own unique spin on superheroes defending the world from alien invaders. \n\n\nThe biggest hurdle *Kinnikuman* faces is that its anime and manga are relatively unknown compared to other anime of its time. This problem is tackled with an Episode 0 that covers the series' basics before thrusting the viewer into the story, providing insight for the show's focus on previous villains standing up to newly introduced enemies.\n\n\nWhile its action is a high point, the production is not without its woes. For every well-animated wrestling maneuver there are several static shots of characters' faces or panning shots. While it's not uncommon for a wrestling match to have slow submissions in the middle of the ring, *Kinnikuman* doesn't do enough to offer a satisfying emotional struggle in these moments. \n\n\nWhile the animation sometimes falters, the creative choreography on display is the show's greatest strength. The combination of traditional wrestling and weapons such as tires and black holes never fails to make each match compelling. *Kinnikuman*'s absurd scenarios are consistently enjoyable and makes for one of the most entertaining action anime of the year.

          "writeup": "The Chinese-based historical epic *Kingdom* charges into its fifth season with the same exploration of what strategies are required to navigate the personal ambitions driving each character in an amplified larger-than-life style. \n\n\nOutside of an excellent final episode that puts the political machinations and larger picture on full display, the majority of this season is focused around a single battle, where the enigmatic bandit Kan Ki is finally given time to shine. The show expertly contrasts his cunning actions with Shin's rather naive morals and integrity which previously tended to go unquestioned. This provides much needed growth for our main character as he rises through the ranks and discovers that war may not be as glorious as he thought. The scale of combat doesn't match some of the previous seasons, leading to lower stakes overall but the utilisation of tactics remains a pivotal tool in showing how the battle unfolds with numerous twists and turns where no character is safe.\n\n\nThis season's primary flaw is its production. Despite benefiting from a substantial increase in quality since the first and second seasons, the visuals are still disappointingly lackluster with heavy use of CGI animals, a reliance on still shots during battles, and the wide shots that show off large sections of the battlefield lacking in detail. \n\n\nHowever, the grand narrative, compelling characters, and creative tactics makes for a great fifth season of this historical epic.",

Renewing the exciting action and fun characters of the first season, *GGO 2* returns with more weapons, fresh locations, and new characters. At times, this season feels a bit directionless and struggles to pick up from the heartfelt conclusion of the first season. We get more development on our protagonist LLENN and her rival Pito while the side cast expands, although this also means less focus on the established characters. In place of spending more time to get to know these characters, this season is more of the same high-octane battle royales with gripping action sequences and cool fight choreography, albeit not as well animated this time.\n\nThe story introduces some new worldbuilding elements inside the VRMMO GGO setting, touching on but not fully developing twists for potential exploration in future content—half-heartedly delving into the topic of AI and humanity. There are new kinds of battles and twists even the characters themselves are surprised by, though the primary appeal remains the same and for those looking for exhilarating gun fights and over-the-top zany characters.\n\nSo while *GGO 2* is not a massive improvement on the first season, it will continue to be a fun watch for those who enjoy the world it is in.",

Its core strength is how it builds upon this premise, how the characters within it are affected by these rules, and how they wish to rebel and be freed from these impositions and the unknown god who established them.\n\n\nEven with the perceived rigidity of the setting, the show is anything but predictable, as the characters involved display both clever interpretations of the rules that control their abilities and the workarounds to counter them, in which the goal for every battle is how to understand the negator or rule they are fighting with and how to outwit them.  \n\n\nHowever, the show suffers from noticeable padding with repeat scenes in order to avoid progressing the story past the intended stopping point with the season finale. Despite this, the story itself is still spectacular with an extremely strong cast, particularly the main characters Andy and Fuuko, with interesting twists and turns throughout. Combined with very well-animated action scenes and a rather unique visual identity, *Undead Unluck* remains one of the most engaging and memorable action shows this year.",

The voice actors accentuate this energy with great performances, including surprisingly good English. \n\n\nThe two main characters, Japan's Isami Ao and America's Lewis Smith, exhibit fun character dynamics with occasional homoerotic undertones, while Lulu exemplifies a great moeblob character and manages to turn incoherent shrieking into heartfelt emotional catharsis. \n\n\nAt times, the comedy can get a bit too campy and the plot operates more on a \"rule of cool\" rather than coherency, with lots of quirky twists and turns and perhaps a few too many one-upping moments which is not entirely unwelcome as it makes for a very fun story. The homages and references are also quite niche and non-mecha fans will struggle to understand the significance of said moments, although they are a treat for those who do. Finally, the CGI does falter at times and is not entirely consistent, but thanks to being helmed by Masami Obari, one of *Bravern*'s strongest aspect is its impressive high-octane mecha animation, CGI notwithstanding.\n\n\nAll in all, *Bravern* delivers a comedic love letter to mecha fans the world over with exhilarating action, goofy over-the-top characters, and dizzying plot twists.",

          "writeup": "Dodging, ducking, dipping, diving, and dodging its way into the Best Action category is *Nige Jouzu no Wakagimi.* The tale of the son of the Kamakura Shogun, who is incredibly gifted at being difficult to catch, is thrust into the merciless realities of a rebellion that leaves him at the behest of a strange priest and his allies.\n\n\nDirector Yuuta Yamazaki's navigation between the light-hearted childlike whimsy of the protagonist and the brutal, demonic disposition of the antagonist Takauji Ashikaga leaves a strong impression. Those around Takauji become bloodthirsty and cruel, while Tokiyuki brings out the good in people surrounding him. This visual and narrative characterization of both sides elevates the show past a simple revenge tale into a grander conflict between good and evil. \n\n\nHowever, the whiplash can be bothersome to those not expecting it, alongside some questionable humor from Tokiyuki's benefactor Yorishige Suwa. The tension set up for survival in a brutal and bloody world is undercut by periods of Suwa comedically interjecting trivial tasks and humor that rarely contributes to the show's themes. \n\n\nTonal impressions aside, *Nige Jouzu no Wakagimi* offers beautiful animation that makes for some stunning visuals. Each cut adds to the believability in Tokiyuki's ability to avoid capture from the litany of villainous characters sent after him. The savagery captures and at times even exceeds the expectations of violence that would come from the era of Samurai. This all comes together for a captivating experience and enthralling action anime.",

Its concept is rather entertaining, as the grotesque monster designs not only feel imposing as threats but also sell the protagonist's newfound powers as he transforms into the very thing he is fighting against. His signature punch is always impactful due to the great visual production, and combined with the focused prowess of the supporting cast—their nimbleness, versatility, and tenacity—the delivery of the action scenes become varied and diverse.\n\n\nDespite presenting an entertaining concept at first, the story beats afterward are predictable and derivative. While the character designs are good and the cast provides great fight scenes, the interactions and bonds between characters feel underexplored and taken for granted. This makes emotional scenes fall flat as the audience is not attached to any of the characters in the first place.\n\n\nWhile the story beats and character writing suffers somewhat, it's clear that *Kaiju 8-gou* focuses on key elements of the series' appeal, namely the grand battles and flashy fight scenes. The protagonist himself remains endearing in his earnestness and keeps the show engaging throughout the whole season as he finally follows the dreams that he thought he had given up on.",

Its impressively extensive and larger-than-life cast showcases a wide array of clever and unorthodox abilities from Soul Reapers and Quincies alike.

Despite this, the season still delivers plenty of payoff from the groundwork done by the previous two seasons with more involvement from Ichigo and compelling backstories for Kyoraku and Bazz-B.\n\n\nOverall, this is yet another well executed, action packed entry leaving a sense of eager anticipation for what the final installment of *Bleach* will bring.",

Jin-U fails to separate himself from other power fantasy protagonists, despite being the only character truly given meaningful characterization. The healer Ju-Hui Lee has an interesting initial character arc, developing apparent PTSD from the same event that gives Jin-U his strength, but it is not explored in a particularly satisfying way. A lot of the narrative beats feel like setup for later entries instead of suiting a standalone season.\n\n\nThe bombastic score by Hiroyuki Sawano and intense animation brings fantastic energy to each fight which highlights Jin-U's struggles and allows *Ore dake Level Up na Ken* to alleviate some of its narrative flaws. The setup elements of the plot also lay the foundation for a grander tale as key players move in the background through individual scenes. The conclusive battle at the end offers this season's greatest highs that will leave many eagerly awaiting more.  ",

Within this space, some superb animation takes place as the ebb and flow of the battle showcases flashy and bombastic attacks. The environment constantly shifts as common urban scenarios are reimagined when outside forces invade and form a detachment from regular reality. \n\n\nOn top of its over-the-top fight scenes, absurd paranormal creatures, and rambunctious comedy, *Dandadan* also delivers on the dramatic front. The backstory of the various monsters are especially emotional rollercoasters, allowing for a contrast between the usually jovial tone with that of a gut-wrenching tragedy where one cannot help but sympathize for the victims-turned-apparitions.\n\n\nThe final product ends up successfully capturing the exuberant energy of teenagers, mixes it up with bizarre tales of the supernatural, and then adds to it explosive fights.

Four girls traversing the fever dream-esque setting of *Shuumatsu Train Doko e Iku* and the demon-driven tank escapades of *Sand Land* showcased the category’s exploration aspects quite well. *Sousou no Frieren* led the discussion on all fronts, enrapturing the jury with both demons and adventures in its standout portrayal of high fantasy and novel takes on classic tropes.   There were also some contenders from long running franchises: *Hirogaru Sky!

While the first half of the series focuses on the aforementioned journey, the second half, unfortunately, fails to maintain the same level of engagement. Despite its attempts to build upon established themes, new conflicts and villains feel less compelling and one-dimensional. Additionally, the show feels tonally imbalanced—ranging from grounded adventure to bombastic fantasy—leaving an emotionally dissonant narrative. \n\n\n*Sand Land* shines in its visual presentation but stumbles in certain aspects of storytelling and sound design. Utilizing exquisite 3D animation with well integrated traditional supplements, the series effectively captures the charm of Toriyama's original character designs. Its phenomenal usage of 3D animation was especially laudable for showcasing the appeal of tank warfare within the unique steampunk/sci-fi setting. However, while the animation is smooth, it occasionally lacks impact in action sequences, making some fights feel weightless and eroding the potential for tension.  \n\n\nDespite some criticisms, *Sand Land* remains an exciting and visually arresting series. Through its imaginative world-building, thematic richness, and its love for having fun, it remains a must-watch for any fans of Toriyama's unique storytelling and characters. ",

Thrown into a journey alongside various casts of previous seasons this time around, with entertainingly fast-paced brawls along the way, the film plays to the nostalgia of long-time fans and newcomers alike. \n\n\nA key appeal for the franchise is the charm of the broad array of characters, and this entry is no exception. The themes of each character are easy to approach and frequent tie-ins from past characters invite newcomers to explore the rich history and charm the franchise has to offer. However, the film is limited in its own ideas by an approach giving an unnatural air to the dialogue as it attempts to juggle its large cast. This awkwardness is further hampered by the barebones story, where the plot composition seems to focus more on mesmerizing the audience with cool explosions and vibrant personas on-screen. The last stretch of the film was fun but chaotic, and has mixed success for the film's resolution. \n\n\nEven so, the core of the film leans into one question--what does it mean to be a Pretty Cure? This constant challenge presented through the film's villain, from start to finish, continually offered opportunity and means for connecting with the past and present of *Precure*, honing in on what has truly made the stories of its characters special across 20 years.",

Sora in particular is a highlight of this entry bringing a lot of energy in how she tackles each and every obstacle put in front of her. Mashiro's arc, where she overcomes her insecure and subdued personality with newfound confidence, is a highlight of the series. Each of their transformation sequences and special attacks stand as a highlight showcasing the animation the franchise is known for.\n\n\nNot without its struggles, *Precure* as a franchise is beleaguered by its weekly monster-of-the-week format. Battles often lack substance compared to the slice-of-life portions. The Undergu Empire is also lacking, leaving little impression as characters. Despite this, as villains they play positively into the themes via different thematic approaches to strength. Strength in power, strength in spirit and strength in motivation. Tsubasa Yuunagi and Ageha Hijiri support the main cures and exemplify these themes. Tsubasa, a bird who cannot fly, tells an effective tale of perseverance as he fulfills his desire to reach the skies.

Outside of Rose, the characters are generally lacking. Side characters have little development, with most lacking any whatsoever. Production elements are unremarkable, despite some great comedic expressions. Fight animation, while a highlight within the show, is not especially impressive.

His growing friendships with Kazuki and Suzune are also appealing, as they spur one another's growth; his exchanges with them help them to grow as heroes and accept their situations. The gimmick of using healing magic for physical training aids this general feeling of progression, as Usato's physical strength grows alongside his mental maturity.\n\n\n\nDespite its flaws, *Chiyu Mahou no Machigatta Tsukaikata* succeeds at being consistently entertaining with its comedic value, primary characters, and sense of progression.",

As a key protagonist, Shizuru anchors the show with a story of change and forgiveness that unfolds suspensefully as she gets ever closer to her lost friend Youka. However, the backloaded development towards the resolution of this narrative limits it somewhat, and neither Youka herself nor the main antagonist manage to bring much to the table despite supporting the central messaging.\n\n﻿\nAn infectious sense of adventure permeates the series, taking full advantage of its reality-bending premise to showcase a variety of environments to explore and people to encounter, all adapting to their new realities in different ways. From a Zen cult of mushroom people to an *Alice in Wonderland*-inspired authoritarian fever dream, the railway to Ikebukuro is never short of surprises and keeps the show fresh and undeniably fun.

As a character, he's entertaining and comical, and the enthusiastic voice performance by Yuuma Uchida goes far in making him compelling. Although Sunraku and his friends don't achieve much tangible character development, their interactions together are a joy to watch. Numerous video game references, along with Sunraku's delightfully creative and unconventional play style, further contribute to this enjoyable energy.\n\n\nThe series does have its weaknesses. The plot, for instance, sometimes feels as though it is deliberately constructed so as to give Sunraku access to unique opportunities unavailable to other players. Furthermore, as the season draws to a close after the epic battle with Wazaemon, the story meanders and fails to reach a fully satisfying conclusion.\n\n\nThe soundtrack nicely matches the energy of the series. Tracks like “Chase” suit the comedy well, while others such as “In Me, Our Love Will Never Fade” effectively support heavier story moments. The animation reaches some spectacular highs, especially during a major second-cour fight, though it's not perfectly consistent and does suffer from some use of ugly CGI enemies.\n\n\nAltogether, *Shangri-La Frontier* makes for great fun and exciting action, earning it a spot among the best adventure shows of the year.",

Norn's struggles parallel Rudeus's past, and Paul's arc reaches its climax, with a standout episode wielding significant emotional weight to fittingly conclude a flawed but compelling character. Rudeus' journey to help his father is similarly strong, bringing intrigue and emotional growth to his character as a backbone for the narrative.\n\n\nVisually, the season continued to miss the mark, especially compared to the first season. The hydra fight did manage to stand out as a strong action sequence, delivering a standout moment despite the somewhat garish CGI. Strong backgrounds elevated the show's production, but these lowered in quality after the story arrived at the dungeon.\n\n\nRomance had an increased role this season, with some lapses in execution. Sylphie's portrayal feels to generally regress in characterisation—she comes off as a doormat to Rudeus' needs, especially regarding the ending. Similarly, Roxy's welcome reintroduction to the series uses a damsel-in-distress format that eschews her prior characterisation in favor of focusing purely on her relationship with Rudeus.\n\n\nUltimately, despite divisiveness found in its peaks and valleys of quality, *Mushoku Tensei II: Isekai Ittara Honki Dasu Part 2* manages to recapture a balance of character development and plot progression that earns it a worthwhile spot in a strong year for adventure.",

          "writeup": "*Sousou no Frieren* follows the journey of its titular heroine while weaving its themes of time and appreciating the little things effortlessly into the story, resulting in one of the strongest fantasy shows in recent years. Her journey's reflections on past and present create an enthralling exploration of the passage of time. This theme is shown through every aspect of the show, from the changes in the environment, to its characters, to the way magic gets used throughout history. \n\n\nFrieren herself serves well as the show's driving force, gluing everything together as a compelling centrepiece for parallels to the past and present synergy with her companions.\nIn particular, the teacher-student relationship she has with Fern is both fun to watch and dramatically meaningful, portraying the give and take of Frieren's experience and Fern's sense of structure and overprotection. Stark rounds out the party's strong chemistry, and together the journey the three take north feels strongly motivated. Each step of the journey serves to breathe life into the world of *Frieren* one adventure at a time.\n\n\nThe production is stellar and has consistently breathtaking animation. Fights are filled with smooth movements and striking effects, and calmer scenes are brought to life with character expression and details like impressive fabric animation. Sweeping cinematic soundscapes from the OST helps elevate scenes and their significance, be it through the use of more serene songs for the slice of life parts like “Time Flows Ever Onward”, or exciting, fast paced, triumphant ones such as “Zoltraak”.

The second season of *Urusei Yatsura (2022)* and the new *Ranma ½* proved to be worthy remakes of Rumiko Takahashi classics, more concise than their predecessors and updated with a modern look.    Contrasting them, *VTuber Legend* is based in an internet space that didn't even exist prior to 2011, acting as a love letter to VTuber fans that could still be enjoyed by all. Meanwhile, *Nokotan* and *Mahoako* pushed the limits of absurdity in their own unique ways, fighting to one-up themselves for their full cours in increasingly ridiculous manners. *MASHLE* also continued that into its second season, pushing human strength to ludicrous levels in its battles with new villains, with the same core cast that made S1 a hit.    Finally, *Henjin no Salad Bowl* and *Hime-sama, \"Goumon\" no Jikan desu* put consistently new yet always entertaining spins on their not-as-absurd-but-still-pretty-wild premises week after week, with the pure creativity and cast variety of Torture Princess ultimately winning out as the best the year had to offer.",

Almost all of the cast have been introduced in the first season, allowing this season to hit the ground running with its signature slapstick humor. \n\n\nThe show is structured as a series of skits, most of which being comedic triumphs where the story just winds the characters up and lets them bash into each other delightfully. Here the science-fiction setting is an advantage, because weird aliens or gadgets can be pulled out to enliven the proceedings. Some of the skits wear out their welcome because they rely too heavily on stock elements of the setting such as Ataru womanizing or Ryunosuke punching her dad. Overall, though, the success rate is high.\n\n\nThe *Urusei Yatsura* remake remains committed to picking and choosing from the long running manga, which means Ataru, Lum, and Shinobu get most of the plot focus. Ataru in particular gets to rise above his jerkass image through scenes like helping Lum with her cow problem, but the series struggles to give everyone in a crowded cast a moment to shine. \n\n\nThe second season also retains its distinctive art style and color palette, successfully emulating an old-school cartoony vibe that complements the slapstick comedy. With *Urusei Yatsura* maintaining its strengths in both humor and production values from the first season, it delivers another strong showing in the Best Comedy category.",

While some viewers may be hesitant that its gimmick would quickly run thin, it manages to continuously refine and iterate its subversion of the cruel “torture” that Hime has to suffer at the hands of the Hellhorde and its master interrogators. Through its easy to love cast of colorful and expressive characters, the show indulges in the little pleasures of life as Grand Inquisitor Tortura and her Harm-marshalls think up various ways to tease out the national secrets of the captive princess.\n\n\nIts consistently creative and cartoony animation style brings life to the hijinks and temptations that Hime faces and enhances the comedic execution of its jokes, delivered by a strong cast of voice actors, coming together with great comedic timing. Hime's own plastic and expressive face and vocal performance are a highlight in bringing forth the comedy as she contrasts between mature stoicism supported by her loyal sword Ex, and helpless temptation in the face of the “torture” she is subjected to. Flashbacks into Hime's backstory and scenes in the wider Demon Realm help balance the slapstick comedy and visual gags with a surprising amount of heartfelt depth and relatability.\n\n\n*Goumon* is a strong and lively comedy that uses its gimmicky premise to its full potential, delivered by a team that brings all aspects of its production together for a comedy at the top of the game.",

          "writeup": "*Henjin no Salad Bowl* presents a charming glimpse into the wonderful tourist destination of Gifu, and the cast who live there. The premise of the show is filling the figurative “salad bowl” of Gifu with a cast of eccentric characters, mixing it up, and seeing the stories that happen as they bounce off each other all around town. From the playground to the racetracks and even the hostess clubs, we see every side of the city. You never know each episode if you'll get a simple schoolyard tale, or instead see one of the cast accidentally join a cult. \n\n\nThe premise relies on strong characters to drive it, and *Salad Bowl* does have several. Livia and Sara are the two standouts, a knight and her princess reverse isekai'd into modern Japan from a magical alternate timeline. Livia represents the comedy of the show at its best with her many failures to adapt to the new world, while Sara shows the heart of the story with her found family storyline with Sousuke. Unfortunately most of the cast is not as eccentric or memorable enough to carry a segment by themselves, especially Sousuke the P.I. who brings very little to the comedy as the male lead. This can leave storylines feeling underwhelming when not led by our two heroines. \n\n\n*Salad Bowl* is not a show that excels in any one area, but has a consistently enjoyable atmosphere that keeps drawing the audience in. A cozy show that deserves its spot amongst the top of the year.",

Every character in *VTuber Legend* is distinct and brings something new for Awayuki to play off of as she rises up the popularity ranks as a VTuber.\n\n\nThe plot is simple but effective, as Awayuki is introduced to new VTubers and takes part in numerous VTubing activities such as playing group games and taking part in live VTuber concerts. These segments were well executed and did not tire during its runtime. However, potentially serious topics find themselves played up for jokes instead of offering commentary on the darker side of VTubing.\n\n\nA large part of the show's appeal is how it integrates references to other media, displaying an authentic passion for VTuber culture. Cameos from other TNK properties like *High School DxD* and pop culture references such as the *Project Winter* episode or Awayuki's ties to the *Strong Zero* drink grant the show a strong sense of immersion, creating the illusion of a genuine VTuber experience. \n\n\nThe production also assists in this, with distinct 3D models for the different characters and an excellent VA cast to portray them. The soundtrack is notable for including references to other noteworthy anime, strengthening the pop-culture appeal. All in all, an excellent anime that comes from a place of real care that matches its outstanding humor and compelling plot points. ",

It is a solid standalone entry that succinctly introduces the core cast and their quirks to newcomers, while also being a nice romp for long-term fans, who get to spend more time with the characters they've grown to love.\n\n\n\nThe movie's biggest drawback is the central conflict about the stolen microfilm, which despite being framed as a catalyst for war between the east and west, isn't fleshed out enough. The maintenance of the status quo is also a noticeable limitation when it comes to the emotional core of the movie, preventing it from achieving any significant emotional impact, as there are no real stakes or meaningful progression in the relationship between its characters.\n\n\nDespite this, the movie is enjoyable from start to finish, with its 110-minute runtime passing by quickly. The cast is just as loveable as always, especially Anya being the world's most adorable goofball and genius simultaneously. And even if the Yor vs Terminator fight feels a bit tacked on, the rule of cool makes this awesome sequence work, and the hapless henchmen hunting down Anya is also a joy to watch.\n\n\nOverall, while not as impactful as the entries above it, *CODE: White* is a fun and worthwhile entry in the *SPY×FAMILY* franchise.",

Everything from the sound effects to the CGI deer to the slow motion effects result in a bizarre and surreal comedy with plenty of fun characters.\n\n\nThe idea of a weird transfer student upending the life of a relatively normal person is a tried and true concept, and while *Nokotan* certainly delivers on its premise, some of the jokes wear themselves a bit thin over time. It doesn't help that most of the side cast that could spice up the humor with their own flavor turn out to be little more than familiar archetypes.\n\n\nBut when it does lean into the core premise of Shikanoko's deer traits and Torako's delinquency, *Nokotan* can deliver some of the funniest absurdist skits of the year. The production choices help accentuate its most eccentric jokes, especially the abundance of sound effects so even if the show isn't extremely visually impressive, it does the job of delivering the comedy.\n\n\n*Nokotan* does not reinvent the wheel or sparkle with creativity, but it does manage to present its myriad of deer jokes with enough variety and fun to create an enjoyable experience.",

While the action's overall visual quality is a notable step up from the previous season, it pales in comparison to other action anime in recent years. The comedy it uses to supplement this action can be hit or miss as the show's protagonist gets a lion's share of the screen time compared to his friends. Aside from Finn, who gets a big display of courage not seen from him before, they aren't given much new material to work with, using the same old attacks and character-based jokes. The storytelling is also, without Mash, nothing particularly noteworthy, unable to stand well on its own, as most of the characters hardly grow in the show's runtime.\n\n\nWhile there are mixed feelings about the execution of any particular area, *MASHLE* still stands out as a nice, if flawed, parody of similar fantasy stories with some room for laughs and an overall good time.",

A particular highlight of this aspect are the anything-goes martial arts events that pit Ranma against a myriad of eccentric characters to fight for his love interest Akane. However, while the side characters make for fun rivals, many of them end up pigeonholed into repeating their gags and feel underwhelming after their introduction.\n\nIn a vacuum, Ranma and Akane's relationship balances moments of genuine care with their constant bickering, leading to a fun dynamic between them. Unfortunately, the story continues to introduce new characters and go on episodic adventures, which sidelines their romance and makes it stagnate over these 12 episodes.\n\nThe production quality is top-notch though, with a popping color palette, malleable character designs, and stellar animation. Its action scenes stand out with their creative choreography and color swapping that makes them visually engaging. \n\nWhether you're a longtime fan or a newcomer, the modern *Ranma ½* offers enough fresh energy and fun to be worth the watch. With a delightful mix of nostalgia and chaotic energy that's hard to resist thanks to its vibrant cast, creative comedy, and well-animated action sequences, it is a solid entry in the Best Comedy category.",

This results in some highly entertaining character moments, such as Magia Azul's masochistic awakening. But with the series largely relying on shock humor and the allure of breaking taboos, *Mahoako* finds itself balancing on a razor's edge between being hilarious and insulting.\n\n\nWhile the comedy generally succeeds with landing on hilarious, the over-the-top sexualization and kinks hamper *Mahoako*'s attempts at more serious drama. The punchline being sexual assault doesn't go down as well when that's also supposed to be the catalyst for Kiwi's character development. The show also has a cavalier attitude towards the age of the characters, with most of the girls in middle school and Korisun being an elementary schooler that has to be aged-up to participate in the kink.\n\n\nThe production of the series isn't very impressive for the most part, but the VA work here is a highlight. Utena is the breakout role for Fuuka Izumi, who really sells the fragile and shy wavering of Utena as well as flipping into a great domineering persona when Utena becomes the leading sadist. \n\n\nUltimately, *Mahoako* is a series that will not land for everybody. But for those who are into its blend of BDSM yuri and magical girl subversion, it provides some of the most unique and entertaining comedy and characters in recent years.",

Despite the long time gap between airing dates, the show picks up right where it left off after the end of the movie. \n\n\nThe show settles comfortably back in that *Konosuba* groove. Aqua is still a drunken overpowered coward, Megumin is still obsessed with explosions, and Darkness is still a masochist, while Kazuma remains the sleazy jerk who is the closest to the adult in the room. The third season experiments with its formula by splitting up the old cast and introducing a new major character, Princess Iris. Unfortunately, Iris struggles to replace the dynamics brought out by the eccentricities of the core cast, mostly serving as the object of Kazuma's little sister obsession. But *Konosuba* still excels when it brings the main four together, building up to its grandiose comedy set-pieces, such as the dinner party or the wedding.\n\n\nEven though it is the characters' misbehavior that builds to the set-pieces, they would not be as hilarious without the excellent animation. Exaggerated character reactions continue to punctuate the comedy, and Megumin's explosions are as spectacular as ever.\n\n\nWhile perhaps not exceeding the heights of the previous seasons, season three is still more *Konosuba*.

Prevailing as an incredible visual spectacle in every aspect, *Uma Musume*'s innate absurdity of a premise gives the film the leeway of leveraging its flexibly charming character designs for lighthearted downtime that's *not* without the presence of great shot composition. All the while its potent directorial intent permeates throughout the whole runtime; its visual storytelling remains on point, with the sound design and color symbolism equally as striking.\n\nThe film's tight focus is on its core characters and rivalry; supported by efficient storytelling through expressive mannerisms, color design, and mainstay visual motifs and symbolism—such as the prismatic set pieces featured in Tachyon's room and Jungle Pocket's accessory—all converge into a strong finale. Although a conclusive and distinct characterization between Manhattan Cafe and Dantsu Flame would've been ideal, the narrative advantageously aligns their emotional progression to the main conflict, as well as connecting Cafe's visualized ideal self to Jungle Pocket's ensuing internal struggles.\n\n\nThe second half delivers a simply wholehearted emotional catharsis, with the rest of the cast similarly providing a nice contrast to the film's pure fervor that pivots away from the series' penchant for its exterior of cute character designs and boundless optimism.\n\n\n*Uma Musume*'s latest entry is a celebration of animation and the talent which helped envision and shape it, spearheading the franchise to greater heights and stakes.",

The film seamlessly ties an engaging emotional buildup to an adrenaline-pumping, action-packed match as teams Shohoku and Sannoh clash against each other for the ultimate win. The 2D and 3DCG fusion enhances the immersion as it incorporates stylized realism with grounded characters. The environment has that pencil sketch aesthetic paired with dramatic camera angles that heighten the emotional impact of key moments.\n\nRyota's transition from past overwhelming grief to a motivated team player is compellingly depicted and serves as an emotional catalyst that amplifies the game's significance. His arc is deeply intriguing, offering a significant pivot point that resonates throughout the game. However, the same cannot be said for the rest of the team, as it struggles to balance the narrative weight across its ensemble cast, leaving the other characters' backstories largely uninteresting and difficult to connect with. The frequent flashbacks, though intended to add depth, feel abrupt and instead hinder the flow of the game.They dilute the impact of the turning points, robbing them of the emotional weight needed to land as effectively.\n\nDespite these flaws, the show manages to be an attention-grabbing experience thanks to the electrifying soundtrack that greatly enhances the energy. The final minutes of the match feel gripping and conclude with a fairly fulfilling instance, making this an enticing sports watch of the year. ",

Throughout his newfound journey, Legoshi encounters many new faces who expand the story's worldbuilding and provide thought-provoking thematic ideas, such as cultural relativism.\n\n\nWith a plethora of new characters being introduced, several of the previously established ones like Louis, Haru, and Juno are relegated to the sidelines or unconnected subplots. This season frequently jumped between separate plotlines, and as a result left the narrative feeling unfocused with watered-down conflicts. This problem could be forgiven if all the new characters are as well written as those they stole the spotlight from, but additions like Melon were lackluster as an antagonist and Yahya is underutilized with a questionable role of what even is a Beastar.\n\n\nThe production is a mixed bag with the staple CG animation of Studio Orange. The fluid body animations are impressive as always, but the awkward facial expressions are a detractor compared to other nominations. The cinematography took a noticeable step down with its frequent use of split screening conversations, which are used as a crutch rather than creating more engaging shot compositions. However, the excellent OST consistently helped set the tone for every scene.\n\n\n*Beastars* continues to provide what fans of the series come to expect with an excellent character drama, but a less refined narrative and several production missteps hold this entry back from reaching its former heights.",

As expected of Studio Ghibli, the production quality is consistently excellent with backgrounds in particular being breathtakingly vivid. The soundtrack by Joe Hisaishi is fairly subdued, but adds to the strong sense of atmosphere with soft, contemplative piano tracks, and suitably grand orchestral pieces for climax scenes.\n\n\nThe arc of Mahito coming to grips with his new life situation and step-mother after the death of his mother is the heart of the movie and themes such as grief, escapism, motherhood, and family are explored in a sincere and poignant way. Mahito has quite an understated personality, which while understandable with his background can lead to difficulties in getting invested in his character. Despite his stoicism, Mahito's emotions still shine through in key growth scenes.\n\n\nBeneath the surface of the adventurous coming-of-age plot, there are many metaphorical and fantastical elements that add to the work's overall complexity. The film could even be described as an autobiographical work, as there are a myriad of parallels to Miyazaki's own life and the movie thought-provokingly questions the legacy that the legendary director will leave behind. While this intricacy makes for interesting analysis, the various elements can feel disjointed and scenes like the birthing room reunion are challenging to parse.\n\n\nOverall, *Kimitachi wa Dou Ikiru ka* is a gorgeous fantasy journey of accepting loss that rewards deeper analysis with its many layers.",

A step up in overall production from its first season, the viewer is dropped into a cour that shifts the focus from the ever popular 2B to her energetic companion 9S and the seemingly cold-hearted A2.  \n\n\nUnfortunately, this focus on the main characters doesn't benefit the litany of side characters that A2 and 9S interact with causing moments with implied emotional payoff to fall flat due to lack of investment into the cast. Furthermore, while the show has the game's impressive OST at its disposal, it's rarely, if ever, used to its full potential. \n\n\nThis exploration of the main duo is one of the series' greatest strengths as the characters run through the narratives that complement one another without relying heavily on the other. Additionally, despite the grand scope of the source material, the events unfold in a way that viewers unfamiliar with the games are easily able to become invested in the world and main characters of this *Nier* iteration.\n\n\nAll in all, *NieR Automata Ver 1.1a 2nd Season* brings a satisfying conclusion to its adaptation with the emotional beats, somber and positive, well intact.

It serves as one of the most respectful depictions of a character moving forward in their life and accepting their own flaws. It works as a creative spin on the trope as well with Nadeko literally having to face who she was in the past with one of the most cathartic conclusions to a character arc.

Where other entries in the franchise had Kumiko tackle others' problems, this is about Kumiko facing the pressure of being both in her final year of high school and the club president. Kumiko is put into a tough position: she must now own up to what she set in motion in her first year and face who she once was to come to find resolution in herself now. This season utilizes the strengths emblematic of the series to communicate its message, featuring excellent direction and lighting alongside expressive character animation. Many shots and scenes are able to carry themselves on the visual aspect alone, being not only beautiful, but meaningful.\n\n\nThe singular focus on Kumiko is appropriate for the final season, but it does come with some trade-offs. Some characters like Shuuichi and Taki still want for development, and while their roles have seen exploration over the course of the series, they're lacking in their resolutions. The pacing sees the full year fit into just these 13 episodes, which gives little breathing room for newly introduced characters or characters not yet explored. Still, some—like Mayu—do stand out as particularly effective in their role, even if not always abounding with characterization. The trade-off is rather worthwhile, getting a focused story about Kumiko for once, but it could have helped to spread things out more.\n\n\nNonetheless, this season of *Hibike!

The 3D animation used works especially well for those cases, having some impressively expressive facial animation. Sadly the visuals are not as consistent throughout, and especially when both 2D and 3D parts are integrated, the show is at its most middling. In a similar vein, while the earlier introduced trio of Nina, Momoka and Subaru are very well characterized,Tomo and especially Rupa, fall a bit to the wayside and find themselves mostly joking without too much in a way of exploring their backstories.\nDespite that, the show still manages to hit the right notes when needed with a great soundtrack and amazing performances on and off stage, especially by Rina, Nina's seiyuu, who deserves a special shoutout. \n\n\nBy wearing her heart on her sleeve and being very straightforward, Nina is able to convey a sense of sincerity that keeps the band as well as the whole show together, delivering a truly remarkable watching experience.",

This lack of depth also extends to the show's handling of its darker themes, as *MahoAku*'s attempts to explore abuse and trauma also consistently fall flat. Similarly, the show often undercuts serious moments by playing them off as jokes.

          "writeup": "Thirteen years later, *Kimi ni Todoke* seamlessly returns to continue a romance classic, injecting a dose of shoujo nostalgia into the modern anime landscape. Elevated by the flexibility of unique hour-long episodes, the social and romantic adventures of Sawako and Kazehaya meticulously recreate the visuals and experience of the earlier seasons as if no time has passed at all. As always, the series delivers strong and consistent characterization and seamlessly blends it with clever comedy through tight scripting. Chibi inserts blend perfectly in and out of the soft visuals to create a traditional yet strong and appealing visual identity. Sawako remains impactful and charming despite taking a backseat, while the increased focus on Kazehaya adds new dimensions to his character, themes, and relationship with Sawako. \n\n\nThe standout element of the season is the narrative shift to other members of the cast. Chizuru's story with Ryu is a highlight of the series, with a fleshed-out backstory and compelling new developments that make for a deeply emotional narrative. Meanwhile, Ayane receives an overdue expansion into a fascinating character in her own right. Her struggles with self-doubt and isolation play wonderfully off the romantic progression of the main couple. Kento's sweet, supportive role likewise effectively establishes him as an equal member of the cast. Each character has a distinct and well realized internal world and personal conflict. These intersect and reflect naturally off of one another, creating a strongly unified story—one that's even greater than the sum of its parts. ",

As a talented actress, Rin Nanakura adopts a variety of personas, transforming into many romantic ideals for her fellow theater club member, Eiji Kitahama, playfully teasing and flirting with him at every turn. While each persona embodies a familiar character archetype, it is through this performance that their dynamic is reimagined, allowing their relationship to blossom naturally. Rather than relying on forced drama, the show empowers its characters to grow organically—Eiji matures emotionally, while Rin learns to be more open with her true feelings. \n\n\nHowever, *Giji Harem*'s unwavering commitment to its premise is both its greatest strength and its biggest drawback. The series leans heavily on Rin's persona-driven antics, sometimes letting skits drag on without meaningful progression. Coupled with its lack of a strong supporting cast, the show lives and dies by its main duo.\n\n\nFrom a production standpoint, *Giji Harem* is one of the weaker nominees, featuring minimal animation and a mostly static camera. However, what it lacks in visual flair, it makes up for in voice acting—particularly Saori Hayami, who brings each of Rin's personas to life with impressive range and nuance.\n\n\nDespite its shortcomings, *Giji Harem* offers a complete, refreshing, and heartfelt romance. Neatly wrapped in a one-cour package and tied together by an adorable pair of doofuses, it solidifies its well-earned place among the best romance anime of the year.",

More than just a heartwarming love story, it highlights the intricacies of living with a disability while navigating the nuances of communication and relationships that come with it.\n\nYuki is a delightful protagonist whose earnestness and endearing qualities bring a natural charm to the story, and watching the sheer delight on her face as her feelings are reciprocated is one of the show's most rewarding aspects. Meanwhile, Itsuomi's fascination with language and communication offers an engaging dynamic between them. However, Yuki's agency within the story can at times feel limited, while Itsoumi's perfection and assertiveness sometimes makes their relationship feel lopsided. The mix of impressively mature relationships among the supporting cast is a standout, yet the emotional immaturity of characters such as Emma and Oushi is often frustrating.\n\nIn spite of these issues, *Yubisaki to Renren* delivers an exemplary romance built on the cornerstones of communication and understanding, emphasizing how important these traits are to the foundation of a relationship. The effort put into portraying the subtleties of Yuki's experiences is evident in the precise character interactions and meticulous character animation, elevating the series into one of the strongest romances of the year.

Unbeknownst to Alya, however, Kuze holds a secret of his own: he, too, knows Russian and understands everything she says.\n\n\nThis playful and slightly silly premise sets up both cute and comedic moments quite well, and *Tokidoki Bosotto Russiago de Dereru Tonari no Alya-san* successfully avoids using this gimmick as a crutch. More than just a novelty, Alya's half-Russian origin ties into her character backstory and meaningfully shapes the story as a whole.\n\n\n*Alya* falters, however, when it shifts focus away from its strengths. After establishing a lively comedic core in its first half, the series pivots sharply into drama, centered on political maneuverings that lack the same charm and a largely forgettable side cast that drags the show down.\n\n\nThat said, when *Alya* sticks to comedy, it's among the best in the category. The hilariously degenerate Yuki is a major standout, with Wakana Maruoka's voice performance bringing her to life in a spectacular fashion. Likewise, Sumire Uesaka excellently conveys Alya's smugness and bravado as she teases Kuze. In terms of production, *Alya* has consistently attractive lighting and character artwork.\n\n\nDespite its narrative missteps, *Alya*'s strengths make it a worthy nominee for best romance of 2024.",

As the title suggests, the heart of the series lies in the evolving and complex relationship between its two leads. Their gradual, well-developed bond, underscored by playful banter and meaningful mutual growth, is the show's most compelling element.\n\n\n*Spice & Wolf* has plenty of positive qualities: solid writing, a well-crafted world, and one of the most grounded main couples of the year. That said, this adaptation has several flaws holding it back. Its production quality is largely underwhelming. Its modern artistic aesthetic, minimal cinematography, and uninspired background art fail to capture the charm of the setting. Likewise, despite the soundtrack's compositional strength, its emotionally charged and intricate pieces are often used in inexplicable or confusing ways, failing to elevate the show's storytelling. \n\n\nSome aspects of *Spice & Wolf*'s presentation evoke mixed reactions—for example, Ami Koshimizu's voice acting. At times, it beautifully captures Holo's personality, adding layers of complexity and ambiguity to her characterization. At other moments, however, it undermines her portrayal as an ancient, powerful, and wise being. This juxtaposition of sophistication and naivety results in a dissonant experience.\n\n\nUltimately, despite some shortcomings in execution, *Spice & Wolf: Merchant Meets Wise Wolf* remains a thoughtful reimagining of the beloved series, distinguished by strong character dynamics and deep worldbuilding.",

At its core, it is a comedy that finds humor in heartbreak, balancing emotional struggles with lighthearted moments.\n\n\n\nThe three losing heroines—Anna, Lemon, and Chika—each have distinct traits and personalities. Anna stands out as the comedic lead, playing into the rejected blue-haired childhood friend archetype. Lemon and Chika are just as fleshed out, and sharp character writing across the board brings out the unique ways each copes with rejection. Rather than following a traditional harem setup, *Makeine* positions its lead, Nukumizu, not as the love interest who fixes their problems, but as an observer and foil to their emotional journeys.\n\n\n\nThe show's comedic highs are occasionally undercut by elements that detract from its strengths. Gratuitous ecchi scenes feel at odds with its otherwise naturalistic tone, and, while the heroines are compelling, Nukumizu is more of a passive observer. The girls have somewhat unbalanced character arcs, and the final episode lacks a strong sense of closure.\n\n\n\nWhere *Makeine* truly excels is its stellar production values. Smooth character animation, lush colors, and excellent lighting enhance both its comedic and dramatic moments. Careful camera work and staging further elevate the storytelling, ensuring that even the smallest gestures and expressions land effectively.\n \n\nUltimately, *Makeine* earns its place near the top of the category thanks to its unique premise, excellent writing, and rich production values.",

Thankfully, this season rose to the challenge: it's a pure, wholesome romance that lives up to the sky-high expectations set by the prior season. \n\n\n*BokuYaba 2* continues to develop Ichikawa's character as he learns to value his girlfriend and himself equally. He puts Yamada's career ahead of their relationship and prioritizes her happiness over his own. As a result, Yamada takes on a less prominent role this season, but that only accentuates how far Ichikawa has come as a character. \n\n\nVisually stunning moments are peppered throughout *BokuYaba 2*, supporting the significant developments in Ichikawa and Yamada's relationship. A combination of soft lighting and thoughtful camera angles helps establish the atmosphere, quite literally framing the show in its best light. The soundtrack further enhances the emotions of these scenes, especially when it reaches a climax as their relationship develops. \n\n\nThe title card drops at the end of every episode effectively emphasize Ichikawa and Yamada's feelings by reiterating the focus of each episode right before the end. \n\n\nOverall, *Boku no Kokoro no Yabai Yatsu* Season 2 was a fitting sequel that stole the show throughout its entire run.

A variety of visuals and animations produce the humor that the series is well-known for.

The series is also sugary sweet to a fault, with every element of the show highlighting its kawaii factor such as the adorable kitten mascots, the soft backgrounds, the pastel colors and the cute character designs.\n\n\nThe anime pokes fun at its own humor in various situations, yet they never linger, creating a series of quick, fun and cute jokes. These come at the expense of its plot, though. Plot points become increasingly repetitive, with the same sequence of events and gimmicks happening in each episode. Most notably, the Mewkle Rainbow seemingly resolves every antagonist the main characters face, stifling character and plot development.\n\n\nStill, *Mewkledreamy Mix!* is a show that manages to be fun by being energetic and humorous, making it one of the great shows of the year.",

This provides a unique theme of how the environment can shape a person as Totto-chan is accepted for who she is. The school staff provide the care and attention students need to grow and feel accepted and loved. Despite Totto's ADHD-like symptoms, the school was able to work with her and foster her growth and interest rather than scold her for being different.\n\n\nThe production is another highlight of the movie. The visual sequences mix different art styles and provide fluid animations, making the movie a joy to watch.\n\n\n*Madogiwa no Totto-chan*'s biggest weakness; however, was its pacing. While the first half flowed well, the second half ended up feeling rushed, both in covering a lot of school years in a short amount of time and in the rapid escalation of important events surrounding Totto that created a bit of a rushed experience.\n\n\nDespite these shortcomings, *Madogiwa no Totto-chan* is a gem of a movie that tells a story of how anyone can be accepted when in the right environment.",

The art style and animation, while simple, allow the CGDCT moments to stand out. \n\n\nWhile they are a spin-off of *Yuru Yuri*, they require no prior knowledge of the series and are perfectly enjoyable for anyone who hasn't seen the parent series.

Their family dynamic is wholesome and their interactions with their friends are enjoyable to watch. The sisters have a solid dynamic and genuinely care for and enjoy each other's company. With their friends they mess around and have fun as kids do. \n\n\nThe subtle soundtrack plays well to the low-stakes nature of the show. There is no build up to no climactic moments, but that is not needed for a show like this. The soft color palette helps emphasise the relaxing tone of the show. However, this also results in the pair of movies only looking as good as an average seasonal anime, when movies generally have higher production values and look better as a result. \n\n\nOverall, *Oomuro-ke: dear sisters* and *dear friends* are as good a reason as any to start watching the Yuru Yuri franchise.

From acclaimed director Naoko Yamada, this short utilizes elements like emojis and song lyrics in place of traditional dialogue to evoke an emotional response from the audience as it dives into themes of grief, loss, and acceptance.\n\n\nFeaturing soft and unassuming character designs, a charming color palette, and some truly inspired visual storytelling, the short is not only pleasing to look at, but easy to get lost in. The soundtrack is also praiseworthy, particularly the song in the back half of the short and how it mirrors the character's feelings. Ending the song with the lyrics “I love you, this is goodbye” perfectly encapsulates the sense of closure that comes with the end of the grieving process.\n\n\nLack of an underlying narrative and inadequate characterization may leave viewers wanting more, however. Overall, the way the short revels in its own experimentation feels pompous in nature, and can be hard to determine where the portfolio highlight reel ends and the heartfelt message begins.\n\n\nEven with those grievances, what remains abundantly clear is the level of effort and care that went into making this short. *Garden of Remembrance* doesn't simply impress in 18 minutes; the emotions and message it conveys surpass what many series can accomplish in a full cour.",

While their shared lonely upbringings and desire for friendship feel overly emphasized at times, their contrasting personalities leads to a gentle comedy routine and heartwarming bond that forms the show's core. Meanwhile, the supporting cast offered good variety, if not depth.\n\n\nVisually, the use of muted colors and soft backgrounds, as well as a hand-drawn aesthetic, contribute greatly to the show's cozy atmosphere. However, the art and animation style struggle to establish an immersive atmosphere around the rare dramatic moments.\n\n\nOverall, *Dungeon no Naka no Hito* is a distinctive fantasy title, blending everyday dungeon upkeep with endearing character interactions. Despite its shortcomings, it stands out as a compelling watch in its genre through its novelty and tonal focus.",

This atmosphere is established by a soft, relaxing soundtrack, and an art style that combines the old nostalgic style of previous seasons with improved animation.\n\n\nThe series provides some unheralded stories, some development on the main character and some of the strongest episodes of the year. The various unheralded stories highlight the yokai and how they have unique burdens and different viewpoints, yet still care for each other. Each episode provides a heartwarming and interesting tale that explores various points of reflection. Compared to previous seasons, Natsume reflects more on how his life has changed and the values and things that he holds dear, creating compelling narrative beats. The series also provides some of the strongest episodes of the year. In particular, the episode detailing the backstory of Reiko through the eyes of a yokai provided a heartbreaking tale that gave more insight into her character as well as the Book of Friends. While the series explores yokai and their experiences well, the main characters (besides Natsume) tend to get sidelined, resulting in less compelling narratives.\n\n\nOverall, *Natsume Yuujinchou Shichi* is a strong piece of work that manages to tell interesting, heartwarming stories about yokai and the uniqueness that surrounds who they are and how they value their relationships with both humans and yokai.",

An anime about fishing is not something you see every day, and the technical knowledge related to fishing is an unusual catch for some. *NegaPosi Angler* starts off strong, with protagonist Tsunehiro being given only two years to live. After running from debt collectors, he bumps into the rest of the cast, and from there a tale of fishing, friendship, and newfound family begins. \n\n\nThe main cast is well-developed, with each of them having their own motivations for going fishing. Hana, Tsunehiro, and Takaaki are well-characterised, and interact well with each other. Hana inspires Tsunehiro to continue fishing, while Takaaki encourages him to make the most of his time while he still can. The cast is rather large, resulting in side characters being neglected, though they too have their reasons for fishing. \n\n\nThe story needs more episodes to further flesh things out, as the dramatic aspect of Tsunehiro's health problems and only having two years to live barely come up in the anime. Instead, Tsunehiro resolves his drama with other cast members in short conversations and off-screen scenes. \n\n\nUniquely expressive 2D character animation and designs were a highlight for some, though this was awkwardly juxtaposed alongside CG fish models and detracted from the immersion of the show's premise. \n\n\nOverall, despite being the one that got away, *NegaPosi Angler* is a comfy enough way to escape from the dramas of life.",

          "writeup": "The main theme of *2.5 Jigen no Ririsa* is cosplay with a cast that gradually grows. The story starts off shabbily as lead character Masamune Okumura comes across as an “incel” (unable to find a romantic partner) and only romantically interested in anime girls. However, as the story progresses from its first arc, the writing steps up. This story subverts expectations by merely brushing against the definition of a harem. Okumura motivates and leads his school's Manga Club into being more passionate and competent at cosplay as they navigate the complex nature of Summer Comiket. Each girl in the Manga Club goes through their own development both individually and in their relationships with one another. This leads to Okumura breaking down the misconceptions around his initially “incel” nature, dealing with heavy topics such as trauma emotionally and respectfully.\n\n\nIn terms of production, the animation and composition are average throughout. The character design is visually distinct, with unique characterisation. However, they lack appeal and memorability to a wider audience. The soundtrack also brings nothing special to the table and is often subdued as the character drama takes precedence. *2.5 Jigen no Ririsa* shines more in its story than anything production wise.\n\n\nOverall, *2.5 Jigen no Ririsa* boasts an impactful story beneath the facade of a generic harem but finds itself hamstrung by average production and a sorely weak start.",

This studio switch brings very apparent changes to several aspects of production. However, the production changes should not be mistaken for weaknesses; what should be just as apparent is that the core identity of *Yuru Camp* is alive and well. \n\n\nOnce again delivering on the premise of “cute girls doing camping things”, this season provides the same drama-free, low-stakes, and heartwarming exploration of rural Japan that viewers have come to expect, while still managing to inject notably more frivolity than previous entries. The renewed focus on humor allows the writing to accentuate strong elements of established characters, like Chiaki, Ena, and Aoi, while continuing to build on Ayano's interactions with Rin and Nadeshiko and the larger group dynamic. And not to be overlooked are the production elements that make *Yuru Camp* unique, such as the excellent lighting and photo-realistic backgrounds, or the relaxing, atmospheric soundtrack. Both of these elements continue to help the series radiate the \"comfy\" atmosphere that make it iconic.\n\n\nDefining what exactly creates that comfy atmosphere has always seemed nebulous and out-of-reach, yet it's clear that the new production team managed to capture it perfectly. *Yuru Camp△ SEASON 3* successfully passes the baton (or rather a steaming mug of hot chocolate), showing the campfire burning at the heart of the series is burning strong.",

Some shows sadly had to be cut during nominations however: *Majo to Yajuu* features a strong leading duo that have to solve various natural mysteries. *Kuramerukagari* is an interesting movie that has a well-thought-out world, yet was held back by its short length.   Two other movies ended up being strong contenders in the category. *Mononoke: Karakasa* takes the aesthetic of the series and ups the production a whole lot for one of the most unique looking anime of the year. *Kitarou Tanjou: Gegege no Nazo* has a strong horror mystery story that intrigued many of the jury. While initially overlooked, *Kuroshitsuji: Kishuku Gakkou-hen* surprised with its strong visual direction in the new season. Though when talking about direction, one cannot forget the clear, even if divisive, vision behind the *Shoushimin Series*. *Sentai Daishikkaku* offered a fun and subversive premise, *Grimm Kumikyoku* is worth watching for episode 6 alone, and *The Fable* with its dry humor and yakuza action also offers an enjoyable watch.   *Dead Dead Demon's Dededededestruction* with its ever looming sense of dread and *Karasu wa Aruji wo Erabanai* with its folklore inspired setting both got a lot of love as well. A show featuring a main character who is equally as interested in mysteries as the jury is, *Kusuriya no Hitorigoto* was for many from the start a clear favorite in the category.",

The result is a collection of stories that provide both intriguing and unsettling takes on familiar narratives, though the show's execution ends up uneven.\n\n\nThe show's strongest moments come early and late, particularly in the first and sixth episodes. Episode 1 stands out with its intense direction and a fresh, villainous take on Cinderella that's both engaging and unpredictable. The atmosphere in Episode 6 is equally striking, featuring a twisted tone and exceptional character animation by Ghibli veterans, making it a definite highlight of the series. CLAMP's character designs are visually appealing, adding a certain elegance to the darker themes explored throughout the show.\n\n\nHowever, the middle episodes fall short—they introduce interesting concepts, such as Red Riding Hood hunting in virtual reality, but these ideas are quickly abandoned in favor of more conventional and less engaging narratives. Episode 3 also suffers from a twist that comes too late to have much impact. The quality of production also dips severely compared to the standout episodes, lacking memorable highlights. \n\n\n*Grimm Kumikyoku* is a mixed bag. Some episodes feature strong narratives and great animation, while others lack the same spark. The show's potential is clear, but its uneven pacing and inconsistent execution prevent it from fully realizing that potential.

The movie quickly pulls the viewer into the tense and bleak atmosphere of post-war Japan with its harsh contrasting lighting, smooth camera transitions, and haunting soundtrack. The central plot revolves around a murder mystery of the powerful Koga family that holds many secrets and serves as a stand-in for both zaibatsu and Imperial Japan. Meanwhile the supernatural elements connect it to a human drama with themes of greed and redemption. \n\n\nThe movie doesn't shy away from depicting some very gruesome imagery. It heavily criticizes Japan's policies during the Second World War by showing how it affected people's mentality and bringing up parallels to some atrocities they committed. The usage of dark red colors and match cuts help maintain a sense of horror, but it also features an incredibly well animated action sequence by *One Piece* regular Akihiro Ota. \n\n\nWhen the supernatural elements come to the forefront in the second half of the movie it unfortunately loses some of its steam. Certain dark twists can be a bit off-putting and the final villain being too over the top ruins the tension of the climax. \n\n\nNevertheless, the great sense of atmosphere, poignant themes, and political critique make *Kitarou Tanjou* a must-watch movie for any horror fan. It works well as both a prequel and stand alone feature and is a very deserving nominee for the Best Suspense category this year.",

Separating the student from the teacher allows them to cover more ground, forcing each to demonstrate their own strengths while undercover.\n\n\nThe production of *Kuroshitsuji* has vastly improved since the original series from more than a decade ago. The current season goes out of its way to use effective lighting and composition throughout that make the world feel vibrant with an undertone of danger. There is also a good amount of staging and gothic visual imagery that enhance the dramatic and comedic moments. \n\n\nThe side cast are a good test of Ciel's abilities, as he proves that he can not only fit in amongst his peers, but also manipulate his way to as close to the top of the school's food chain as he can. They aren't given the time they need to truly come into their own though, and many of the characters outside of the lead duo end up feeling no more than a plot device. This leads to stretches that focus on Ciel alone, creating some lulls in the pacing of the season that feel like they could have been filled with stronger character moments.\n\n\nBut overall, this season successfully builds on the story of *Kuroshitsuji* with novel challenges for the main duo.

          "writeup": "After a 17-year hiatus, *Mononoke: Karakasa* is a dense and thrilling reintroduction to the franchise. The first movie in a new trilogy, *Karakasa* tells a self-contained story following two servant girls—Asa and Kame—in their journey through the dehumanizing Japanese emperor's harem—the Ooku. There the story of the girls intersects with the enigmatic Medicine Seller, who helps solve the mystery behind the Ooku's corruption when it takes a supernatural turn.\n\n\nThe storytelling is quite cryptic and often cloaked in metaphor, so the movie demands careful attention for its entire 90 minute runtime. The action scenes in particular opt for frequent cuts and changes of perspective, which make for an energetic, but not completely coherent viewing experience.\n\n\nWhile the editing may not land for everyone, the rest of the movie's production is a triumph. Its Edo-era aesthetic is infused throughout the art design, using a painterly style that matches the interior decoration of the Ooku. Even small details of the setting are used, like the sliding doors that fill the Ooku snapping shut to punctuate scene transitions. The supernatural mononoke itself is kaleidoscopic, making its eruptions into our world distinctive, while the human characters other than the Medicine Seller are drawn in a clean, realistic style. The movie also has excellent sound design, with the percussion of the Medicine Seller's mystical gadgets and wooden shoes used to dramatic effect.\n\n\n*Mononoke: Karakasa* makes for a powerful, almost overwhelming, viewing experience.",

          "writeup": "*The Fable*'s hardboiled, fish out of water story is conceptually interesting, but often fails to rise up to its full potential. That doesn't mean it's bad—far from it. Watching the eponymous hitman Fable trying to live a normal life, just to get constantly dragged back into trouble is a blast. The dry delivery of sitcom moments makes for enjoyable chuckles, which the show deftly weaves together with a cathartic tale of a severely damaged person's slow recovery. Lines like “I don't consider this dirty” when doing something that makes him physically dirty hit especially hard, as helping others with “dirty tasks” has become a cleansing experience compared to his “dirty work” as a killer.\n\n\nHowever, the show has three main shortcomings. The stilted animation is obvious from first glance, and while consistent, the art looks relatively flat, and not in an artistic way like *Mononoke: Karakasa*, another nominee this year. Certain episodes also feel padded, with the show straining itself to achieve a cliffhanger ending for most episodes, leading to inconsistent pacing.\n\n\nLuckily, the solid voice acting across the board somewhat makes up for the poor visuals, with Sawashiro Miyuki's performance as Youko being a highlight. This helps elevate the characters of the show, be they likeable or disgusting, with the chemistry between Fable and Yokou always being a joy to watch.\n\n\nOverall, *The Fable*'s shortcomings as an adaptation keep it from being on par with the anime above it, but its endearing characters and unconventional execution are enough to make it a worthy nominee.",

In this world, the so-called \"heroes\" are selfish, power-abusing villains, and the true protagonists are the minions of the Monster Army, tasked with dismantling the corrupt system. It's a unique take that makes for a promising foundation, though its execution stumbles along the way.\n\n\nThe characters' motivations are well thought out, with the central character—Foot Soldier D—being placed in a position where he must constantly reassess his beliefs and ideals. This creates a dynamic arc for D as he wrestles with his personal growth. However, many of the supporting characters fall into familiar shonen archetypes, and their developments often feel predictable, following well-worn paths that diminish their potential impact.\n\n\nDespite being a colorful and decently animated show for the most part, issues with pacing and editing hamstring it massively. After an exciting opening, the story slows down to a crawl with a classic shounen tournament exam arc, while the narrative jumps erratically between multiple storylines. This results in a disjointed flow, making it difficult to stay connected to the unfolding events and follow the progression of time, in addition to the inconsistent pacing which hinders the overall engagement with the plot.\n\n\nDespite its issues, *Sentai Daishikkaku* wraps up on a strong note, and with a second season coming out this year, the aforementioned issues with its exam arc may fade away with the groundwork laid in this season.",

          "writeup": "Set against the backdrop of a massive disaster in Tokyo, *Dead Dead Demon's Dededededestruction* gives us a look into the lives of the civilians dealing with it. There's an ever looming sense of dread watching the show, which impressively combines the comedic and dramatic slice of life moments with it. This is also bolstered by the cute, yet somewhat ugly character designs that stand out despite the rather conservative animation.\n\n\nOriginally written by Inio Asano, *DeDeDeDe* comes with a healthy dose of cynicism reflective of the Japanese millennial youth, and by extension has plenty of societal criticism of Japan. The state of politics and the politicians is satirized, and the youth have little hope in the mess that they find themselves in. One such youth is one of our main characters, Ouran, who insistently makes fun of the hopeless political situation they find themselves in. She forms a fun pair together with Kadode, who has a more down to earth personality that's juxtaposed with Ouran's excessiveness. \n\nThe rest of the well-rounded cast offers a wide range of reactions to living under the threat of invasion. *DeDeDeDe* shows how there's a certain mundanity to people's lives despite the situation. And yet, there's still joy to be found in the interpersonal relationships of the characters, who demonstrate how through all of the anxiety and fear they can still be happy.\n",

          "writeup": "Long awaited by fans of its source material, *Kusuriya no Hitorigoto* presents an exceedingly intriguing story about navigating daily life at the imperial palace from a fictionalized version of imperial China. The anime's strongest point is undeniably its main character—Maomao. She is exceptionally resourceful, observant and has a refreshingly dry sense of humor, which makes her solving seemingly small-scale mysteries around the palace a treat to watch. Being near the bottom of the court's hierarchy, she needs to rely on her wits to survive and achieve her goals, leading to engaging plots and schemes. The show's slow burn intrigue comes to a great conclusion, which manages to tie together the disparate plot threads from past mysteries for a nerve-wracking race against time. \n\n\nFor the production side, *Kusuriya* features thoughtful lighting and color design to set the mood, with a darker palette giving a clear identity to the night and twilight scenes. From the chibi faces to Maomao's iconic poison-tasting face, the high quality draftsmanship of the character drawings as ensured by Yukiko Nakatani is another highlight. Also notable is the soundtrack of the series, which manages to blend tracks from three different composers—Kevin Penkin, Alisa Okehazama, and Satoru Kousaki—into one show. *Kusuriya* expertly draws from the individual strengths of each of them to create an impressively varied and yet highly cohesive whole.\n\n\nCombining an engaging palace drama with impressive production quality and featuring an incredibly well written main character, *Kusuriya no Hitorigoto* easily deserves a spot among the best suspense anime of 2024.",

From *Sousou no Frieren* to *Tsue to Tsurugi no Wistoria*, the year felt primarily like an examination of which shows could consistently provide both strong and captivating action spectacles, as well as impressive character acting moments during downtime. It’s for this reason that shows like *Hime-sama, “Goumon” no Jikan desu*, *Ore dake Level Up na Ken*, *Yoru no Kurage wa Oyogenai* and  *WIND BREAKER* narrowly missed out on jury nominations. Despite showcasing an impressive array of highlights, they didn’t manage to create an as strong and persistent showcase of animation as the anime that ultimately made the cut.   While shows like *Kaijuu 8-gou* or *Undead Unluck* boasted fantastic effects work throughout, *[Oshi no Ko] 2nd Season*, *Hibike! Euphonium 3* and *Make Heroine ga Oosugiru!* captivated their audience with standout character animation. However, the best nominations seamlessly blended both strengths into a cohesive visual experience. Though *Dandadan* and *Wistoria* lacked some consistency for a higher placement, *Dungeon Meshi*, *Frieren* and *Nige Jouzu no Wakagimi* emerged as the top three nominees, impressing the jury with their combination of unique action, stunning effects work, and soulful character acting.  Of these three, Trigger's production stood out the most thanks to its idiosyncratic animation direction and stylistic variety, cementing it as the category winner.",

Colette's [bubbly personality] (https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/e0d52bb867d5ef32064009460ba43079.mp4) and Sion's [arrogance] (https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/9b2db1ed6deef9cdda5d91762026ab45.mp4) shine through animation alone, while Will's warmth comes through in a simple moment of [dapping up his cat] (https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/a351a0b21acd8144023728f9fdba9384.mp4).\n\n\nHowever, many of *Wistoria*'s shortcomings stem from a lack of consistency, with none of the later episodes coming close to the level of excellence seen in the beginning. Sporadic moments of character acting appear rough, both due to production circumstances and the relative absence of character designer Yoshihara. While the major action sequences, featuring prominent names like Tnk, miso, and Isuta, are extremely ambitious, they lack the polish needed to be truly impressive due to subpar in-betweening and compositing.\n\n\nThese several major shortcomings resulted in *Wistoria*'s relatively low placement. However, at its best it showcased dynamic background animation, imposing magic/effects work and fun character animation that could go toe to toe with the best 2024 had to offer, and had the potential to ascend further up the rankings.",

This effort is evident in the use of 3D animation for more challenging scenarios like horse riding and competitions, as well as in striking and impactful character drawings that add snappy intensity to tense moments. These weaker moments, however, are rare, as with all-star contributions from action legend Arifumi Imai, series director Yuuta Yamazaki, and Yuusuke Kawakami, the show reaffirms its commitment to delivering a visually remarkable experience at every turn.

This season shifts even further toward nuanced, subtle movement, adding depth to both old and new cast members. There are plenty of instances where body language informs character thoughts and feelings more than words, while moments of added exaggeration punctuate the mood. The level of care and attention to detail aims for a deeply immersive experience, making the story as close to life as possible.\n\n\nThe show's consistently strong animation direction features some highly detailed close-ups, particularly in Tomomi Sato's sequences from Episodes [3](https://www.sakugabooru.com/post/show/255487) and [12](https://www.sakugabooru.com/post/show/259302). However, this approach somewhat limits flexibility, especially in more comedic character expressions. While the hand-drawn instruments remain incredibly accurate and detailed, this season's structure pushes most performances offscreen, resulting in far fewer music-playing scenes compared to previous seasons. The final performance is also overcut with flashbacks, relying heavily on static close-ups and stiff, mechanical movement, making it visually underwhelming.\n\n\nDespite these issues, the level of effort and craftsmanship on display remained consistently high throughout S3, with individual climatic moments even surpassing its predecessors. Kyoani has changed, yet it remains the same, and its latest TV anime stands as another great achievement in its established animation philosophy. ",

Instead, characters express emotions by stills, reaction face pop-ups, or internal monologues, failing to fully utilize the expressive potential of animation.\n\nStill, there are standout moments of exceptional animation, such as the [abstract, surreal sequence](https://www.sakugabooru.com/post/show/262662) in episode 6, filled with colorful effects, as well as the [dance video](https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/58460919e5d933c893b48512be321478.mp4) at the season's end, with fast-paced comedic acting, poignant cast expressions, and animated background art. While *[Oshi no Ko]*'s execution may be questionable, its strong action scenes, excellent effects work, and meticulous character designs solidify its well-deserved nomination in the category.",

While Trigger veterans continue to leave their mark - Kanno delivering [shockingly realistic creature animation](https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/6fff81e06f359a5bc67355c330b068a1.mp4), Ikarashi showcasing [loose, morphing character exaggeration](https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/524ce80de4101faecfc54ece8e828aaf.mp4), and Sushio bringing his [signature weighty action sequences](https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/9366d4137ed745b441830e1dfee34a7f.mp4)- the series also provides a platform for emerging animators like [Sho Oi](https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/6da0e1a479a906cc5fcb83887eac74b7.mp4) and [Haruki Sakamoto](https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/b121d3a6bead8e0229397aa7c9809dac.mp4), as well as newcomers to Trigger such as [Onodera](https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/3f18ece4b98dca3f90596ef86b6f6665.mp4) and [Myoun](https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/9ae149fceb9ce9015ff558db26790710.mp4). Intelligent outsourcing plays a key role in expanding the talent pool and integrating these newcomers into the fold, further allowing the vast stylistic and idiosyncratic expression that makes the show feel so alive. Despite its visual variety, the production remains shockingly consistent, leveraging its episodic nature to explore different approaches.\n\n\nFurthermore, the show embraces the [cartoony, comedic approach](https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/941aee0a44e8b40d0b788ea7ffd87100.mp4) to character acting that Studio Trigger is known for, featuring loose, expressive takes on designs when needed. The integral cooking sequences are also given an impressive level of care, with each episode introducing new recipes that bring [unique movements to the process](https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/923bd269b7ce282a79462d72b244abf0.mp4) of chopping, plating, and eating, making each episode's cooking sequence feel fresh, and just as engaging as the weighty action. Ultimately, *Dungeon Meshi* is a testament to the strength of Trigger's ever-evolving approach, and is undoubtedly a standout this year.",

Fights and [chase sequences](https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/ccfd8a0c8d95838f6384f833120e6fd1.mp4) are storyboarded effectively throughout most of the runtime, ensuring proper control of space and environmental traversal.\n\n\nThe main detraction from an otherwise ambitious production emerged as the show progressed and the schedule became more strained. Due to a number of off-model drawings requiring corrections, along with Onda's absence as the show progresses, some actions feel mistimed and clunky. Additionally, the action itself is toned down in its portrayal, such as the lackluster [chase sequence with Taro](https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/a9857093c48cfc21a26971651893ab17.mp4) or stiffer depiction of [Aira's ability against the Serpoains](https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/bea1178790d57f0a300adf069febda8e.mp4), compared to earlier episodes that executed similar ideas more effectively.\n\n\nWhile these production inconsistencies hold the show back at times, it still delivers some truly remarkable sequences. Of most significance comes to light with Shuuto Enomoto's [parallel depictions of grief](https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/d270a7a5e74cf6547ffa555d512c4295.mp4) between [Acrobatic Silky's past as a mother](https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/285f37baea49bd895eb6b1e2c7916133.mp4) and [Aira's feelings towards her own mother](https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/257c204562cd11e45042af2fed742305.mp4).

          "writeup": "After the sudden success of *Bocchi the Rock*'s adaptation, Director Keiichiro Saito reaches resounding heights with an ambitious and impressive fantasy adventure in *Sousou no Frieren*. The show prides itself in its incredible consistency in production, an especially strong feat given the increasing challenges of sustaining uniformity in long-running series recently. The baseline being so solid results in barely, if any, episodes coming across as overly stagnant, while continuously delivering the expected excellent visual experience.\n\n\nWhile *Frieren* may not continuously offer the same stark diversity in animation techniques or creative departures from its established aesthetic as entries like *Dungeon Meshi* or *Nige Jouzu*, its animation approach thrives through its weighty and grounded character acting. This commitment enhances the down-to-earth tone of the show's earlier portions, while also elevating its action-heavy episodes and extended animation sequences. Incorporating plenty of background animation cuts, as well as a plethora of background animation cuts and unique magic effect work, *Frieren* also offers lovely visual moments to chew on that further increases the immersive draw of the series. \n\n\nIndulgent expressions of talent are a regular occurrence, in part due to the combined resourcefulness and connections of Animation Producers Takashi Nakame and Yuichiro Fukushi, major coordinators for some of the show's most memorable sequences. Highlights from Episode Directors Tooru Iwazawa, Kouki Fujimoto, and Hirotaka Mori are among the many exciting guest appearances on the series, whose evocative outings are supported by household favourites such as Shingo Yamashita, Keiichirou Watanabe, and more. This melting pot of talent significantly strengthened its visual identity, creating one of the most recognizable and appreciated works of the past few years.",

The quality of nominees this year was high. While the jury found it easy to narrow down their options in 2023, this year offered a rich assortment of candidates difficult to bring down to a final five.     Although *Bucchigiri?!* and *MahoNare* were initial frontrunners in jury discussion, an obscure contender from Studio Khara, *The Diary of Ochibi-san*, came to the jury’s attention late and quickly gained steam. As *MahoNare* lost some traction in the final discussions, the decision on the winner came down to a tiebreaker between the other two.   Additionally, the apocalyptic backgrounds of *Kaiju No 8*, the detail of *The Apothecary Diaries* and the worldbuilding of *Sousou no Frieren* gained very similar levels of praise. It was incredibly difficult to rank any of these quality entries above each other. This was more palpable as the luminous backgrounds of *The Elusive Samurai* and the deep, delicious dungeons of *Dungeon Meshi* placed around this trio. The year offered a wealth of variety and quality throughout our nominees.",

          "writeup": "*The Diary of Ochibi-san* provides a lot to love under first-time Art Director Seina Yaguchi. Its use of a storybook art style produces a beautiful expression of nature. This style is defined by its color and the depth it evokes through pop-up-book-esque layering of flat background elements.\n\n\nAs Ochibi explores the world around him as the seasons change, the color work is particularly key. From snow whites to blossom pinks, *Ochibi-san* uses primary colors and pastels to bring a childlike quality to the art that grounds its strong artistic identity. Their custom-made brush imitating stencil technique strengthens this vision. While its paper-like filters are sometimes distracting on indoor backgrounds, the color and textures work to great effect in the nature scenes that make up the majority of the show.\n\n\nThe show's innovative use of multiplane background art in the digital era is also of particular merit. *Ochibi-san*'s immersion in nature demands expansive backgrounds. This sense of space is achieved with the camera's movement in depth through a multiplanar image. Parallaxing movement of layers and varying degrees of background detailing to imitate depth-of-field successfully pull the viewer into a sense of cartoonish realism.\n\n\nThis background art style goes against the grain, not aspiring to simulate a realistic, three-dimensional perspective, but *Ochibi-san* demonstrates the impact simple, thoughtful and norm breaking methods can achieve. \n",

Its background art depicts a world rampant with graffiti, barrages of color, and unique Arabian cultural influences with stunning levels of detail. \n\n\nThe world of *BUCCHIGIRI?!* is full of originality, an exuberant portrait of urban life taken over by gang culture. Schoolyards are thrashed with pop-art graffiti and destruction, shrines overtaken by overgrowth and time, all painted with vibrant color and the utmost level of care. \n\n\nThe unique setting is realized through exceptional art style, keenly detailing the thematic relevance and standout visual identity of its backgrounds. What makes the visual style stand out the most from its contemporaries is its razor-sharp focus on texture and ornate patterns. The derelict schoolyards are not only wrought with vandalism, but depicted with fine details such as rust and shards to highlight the destruction with meticulous detail. These are juxtaposed by the scenes set in the shrines full of Islamic architectural inspirations and ornamental patterns.\n\n\nWhere *BUCCHIGIRI?!* begins to falter is in the variety of its locales, which only cycle through a select few familiar set pieces throughout its runtime, ultimately leaving something to be desired. Despite this, *BUCCHIGIRI?!* is a delightfully unique world full of standout visual quirks and excellent thematic storytelling, and certainly a favorite amongst this year's background art. \n",

This color work helps the backgrounds in the show stand out with its use of contrast and also leads to beautiful landscapes with pop art style coloring for the foliage within. However, *MahoNare*'s style does have its downsides. A lack of outlining on objects combined with the pastel coloring leads to backgrounds that sometimes end up feeling flat. Additionally, while an important part of the picture book feel of the backgrounds, the usage of a filter can become too overbearing, which mostly occurs during indoor scenes.\n\n\n*MahoNare*'s architecture possesses novelty that helps add to the already great worldbuilding element of the show's backgrounds. While there is some inconsistency, *MahoNare* boasts strong backgrounds both [outdoors](https://i.imgur.com/sy7ctLM.jpeg) and indoors, such as the [colorful library](https://i.imgur.com/5105X2l.jpeg) and [clubroom](https://i.imgur.com/eDL0I37.jpeg) filled to the brim with piles of books.

However, its lack of detail and inconsistency across the series leaves its background art lacking true standout elements.\n\n\n*Dandadan*'s understanding of framing is its particular strong suit. Linework and layering are used to give locations a sense of space and draw the viewer's eye between different elements of the background such as in Momo's house. *Dandadan*'s yokai backgrounds are all marked by a single color. While this creates an easily understandable narrative language, the backgrounds themselves end up less compelling and more washed out. This means that, at times, the quality of the backgrounds is compromised for the sake of narrative language. While *Dandadan*'s color design at times excels to match the strongest nominees, the aforementioned choice undermines *Dandadan*'s aesthetic to a substantial degree.\n\n\nAs *Dandadan* progresses further into the show, the overall quality deteriorates and the successes of the highly detailed locations are not consistently recreated. For these reasons, despite strong construction and memorable color choices at times, *Dandadan*'s backgrounds are too much of a mixed bag.\n",

In the Rear Palace, the viewer is treated to a deluge of vibrant areas, with high levels of detail in the Imperial Chinese style which conveys the wealth held by the highest ranking members of the palace. This rich level of detail makes sense for the most prominent areas in the series.\n\n\nThroughout *Kusuriya*, wealth disparity is conveyed effectively through the scenery. The poor town where Maomao once resided is showcased with worn buildings and overgrowth, worlds apart from her current residence. The background art also shows a sensible level of scale, with establishing shots used effectively to demonstrate the vast world within and beyond the Rear Palace.\n\n\nThe main detractor in *Kusuriya* is that some backgrounds appear overly smooth and flat when they could be so much more. There is a notable level of inconsistency when comparing this to the high levels of detail displayed in other areas which can be jarring. At its worst, different degrees of detailing are present within the same images, making nearby objects not come together into a coherent picture. \n\n\n*Kusuriya*, particularly in its most frequently visited areas, boasts a rich variety of high quality backgrounds, but has issues with its inconsistent amounts of detailing over the series. Irrespective of this, the depth and precision to display themes of wealth disparity and Imperial Chinese shine throughout.\n",

What it does have is artistic creativity in spite of a setting full of gray stone walls and tiling. Detailing in the cracks and foliage along the walls, brings even the sparsest dungeon hallways and rooms to life.\n\n\nThe construction of its layouts is one of its greater strengths, as seen on the floor with a large body of water. The use of a bright blue contrasts with the dull grey of the dungeon's walls sets a unique atmosphere through a very minimalistic approach. However, it does mean there's few attention-grabbing backgrounds during the greater amount of its runtime spent in corridors and small rooms.\n\n\nWhen breaking from its grey walls, each floor manages to have its own unique intricacies, showing the breadth of *Dungeon Meshi*'s world building.  On the second floor with the treetop area there's a stunning beauty to the trees and foliage that makes for a memorable set piece. Using the same painterly style that makes the texture of each brick wall in the dungeon remain unique, the greenery, bridges and trees uniquely stand out during the show's adventure. All these elements come together to breathe life into the world behind our cast as they delve deeper into the dungeon.\n",

They have an indirect but important effect on the viewer's perception of the show.\n\nA key location in *Makeine* is the school, which has been given a [distinctive look](https://files.catbox.moe/ha8ve5.jpg): it appears aging due to a patina of rust on the staircases, eroding stones and walls. This supports the main narrative of moving away from an idealistic view of youth, focusing instead on how the characters grow up and move on from their first crush.\n\nConsiderable attention in backgrounds is paid to color hues, which associate certain moods with  locations and events.  Early episodes set in spring, in which hopes for young love are yet to be destroyed, depict the school in [green](https://files.catbox.moe/e0k383.jpg), the emotional search for the runaway girl is given a disturbing [red](https://files.catbox.moe/1ne6kf.jpg), and the more depressing moments of the show are desaturated and [grey](https://files.catbox.moe/4cxijh.jpg).\n\nHowever, *Makeine*'s backgrounds lack equal finesse on technical execution or stylization. The detailing, outside of individual elements like aging textures or symbolic clouds, is lackluster too. This is not helped by the filtered [photo-backgrounds](https://files.catbox.moe/zqvgno.jpg), which look noticeably worse than the drawn ones. \n\nDespite these aesthetic weaknesses, *Makeine*'s integration of its backgrounds in its worldbuilding is extremely interesting for a down-to-earth romcom, thanks to which *Makeine* earns its place among the best backgrounds of the year.\n",

It possesses a wonderful amount of seasonality and gives a constant reminder of the past with statues of Himmel in various places Frieren's party travels to.\n\n\n*Frieren*'s world is relatively traditional for a fantasy setting, meaning its backgrounds don't often stand out compared to more imaginative worlds. Despite this, *Frieren*'s backgrounds still breathe life into the show's world through the wide variety of different architectural styles, where no two parts of the world look the same. This helps make *Frieren*'s world a believable one, selling that the party is traveling to vastly different parts of it.\n\n\nHowever, as the traveling stops, most of the second half of the show lacks this variety in its more static setting. Nonetheless, many strengths of *Frieren*'s backgrounds carry through these parts, like its strong painterly style and beautiful sceneries with large amounts of detail. Also, the few areas that are present during the latter half of the show both feature a large sense of scale and showcase many different parts of them making for stand-out areas that are well-realized. Despite sometimes struggling to stand out, *Frieren*'s backgrounds build a world that feels lived in and perfectly highlights the passage of time throughout Frieren's long journey.\n",

There was a decent overlap between the jury discussions and public nominations this year: *Dungeon Meshi* ends up as jury winner through its feast of monster and human designs while *Make Heroine ga Oosugiru*’s adorkable expressivity makes the cast feel alive. Both *Dandadan* and *Sousou no Frieren* were also praised by the jury, and even the curveball *Oshi no Ko S2* features fun alternative theater outfits.  The ranking was determined through a set of metrics, including animation friendliness i.e the mutability of lines and shapes for expression, recognizability of silhouetted forms, coloring and shading, costumes and accessories, and an overall perspective on how these designs reflected the personalities and narrative of the characters. The support for *Dungeon Meshi* was broad, leaving the battle for second place up to a close race between *Puniru wa Kawaii Slime*, *Kusuriya no Hitorigoto* and *NegaPosi Angler*.",

          "writeup": "*Bucchigiri?!* offers a charming spin on the classic bishounen character design philosophy. This is largely thanks to the efforts of Character Designer Takahiro Kagami in crafting an interesting [variety](https://cdn.imgchest.com/files/4gdcxv2gv34.png) of body builds that balances a neat sense of [unification and individuality](https://cdn.imgchest.com/files/49zc2gk636y.png), for both the cast of [delinquents](https://cdn.imgchest.com/files/y8xcnlg9ow4.png) as well as its Djinn influences through [Senya](https://cdn.imgchest.com/files/4apc5dzrlz4.png) and [Ichiya](https://cdn.imgchest.com/files/46acqaorov7.png).\n\n\nThe two main gang oppositions, [Siguma Squad](https://cdn.imgchest.com/files/yq9c35a8qq4.png) and [Minato Kai](https://cdn.imgchest.com/files/739cxn59zo7.png), each carry their own flavor. The character groupings tend to match with their color design approach, focusing on pairing off [hair colors](https://cdn.imgchest.com/files/ye3c2poaxg4.png) as well as using [matching armbands](https://cdn.imgchest.com/files/4jdcvwznvk4.png). On the other hand, Arajin's mixture of [Chinese clothing](https://cdn.imgchest.com/files/7w6c2mnlnvy.png) with his [black uniform](https://cdn.imgchest.com/files/4z9cv83o3k7.png) puts him squarely as an outsider in terms of both build and personality. This division is amplified through [Senya's Arabian influences](https://cdn.imgchest.com/files/49zc2gkwg8y.png), [pink/orange color scheme](https://cdn.imgchest.com/files/yd5cez3j9j4.png), and [bulky physique](https://cdn.imgchest.com/files/45xcvkmdgj7.png).\nKagami takes these ideas further by making Arajin and Senya both incredibly [malleable](https://cdn.imgchest.com/files/y2pck9aznl7.png) in terms of their line weights and how their [shapes contort](https://cdn.imgchest.com/files/7mmc9wgvm67.png) and [exaggerate](https://cdn.imgchest.com/files/7lxcpg3nn27.png) for comedy. In particular, Kagami's [thicker line corrections](https://cdn.imgchest.com/files/7ogcb8p5djy.png) for [Arajin's punches](https://cdn.imgchest.com/files/yxkczjxron7.png) carries a strong flavor of power and ferocity.\n\n\nAs unique and interesting as these designs can get, outfit selection tends to be on the weaker side for the cast; outside of variations of Arajin's wardrobe, most characters tend to be one note in their style. [Mahoro](https://cdn.imgchest.com/files/4jdcvwzn9b4.png) in particular is an unused opportunity for variety due to her sharply detailed [floral patterning](https://cdn.imgchest.com/files/739cxn593r7.png), [“pure maiden”](https://cdn.imgchest.com/files/7lxcpg3nx57.png) color design and [interesting shapes](https://cdn.imgchest.com/files/4z9cv83ozj7.png). Additionally Mahoro's hair patterning has a pink stripe that doesn't provide strong contrast with her uniform due to the mix of bright colors. \n\n\nNevertheless, the cast of *Bucchigiri?!* carries a memorable identity that imparts a dichotomy of uniformity and individualism that's deftly portrayed through its group dynamic and powerfully iconoclastic leads.\n",

The diverse set of designs helps teach that fishing can be for everyone, no matter what their life situation is, and they are executed excellently.\n\n\n*NegaPosi*'s character designs have unique features which you'd have a hard time finding elsewhere.  Hana's giant teardrop hair would be impractical in real life, but it mirrors her eccentric personality towards fishing. Ice's design is a triumph, as she literally transforms from a short, chibi girl to a taller, mature woman when getting ready for her job as a cosplayer and model.\n\n\nCharacter expressions are another strength of *NegaPosi*.  One recurring feature is the characters' large chins and blobby faces when they're being smug or elusive.  When the narrative calls for it, *NegaPosi* also manages to pull off serious expressions.  \n\n\nAs a show about fishing, *NegaPosi* should not be let off the hook for its fish design.  The choice to go with a hyperrealistic look clashes with the overall style.  In addition, few characters are underutilized, such as Kozue.  Her “nice girl” look isn't used creatively when compared with the other characters.\n\n\nNonetheless, *NegaPosi* demonstrates undeniable prowess in bringing solid base designs to  the next level.  It is a treasure of an experience watching how the show builds the characters up through design, and it wholly deserves this recognition.\n",

          "writeup": "True to its title, *Puniru is a Kawaii Slime* has one singular goal that it finds important above all else: showcasing the appeal of its titular lead Puniru in as many ways possible. The show never fails to get maximum comedic mileage out of Puniru being a literal slime, slicing and dicing her up as the situation calls for. Puniru's uniquely slime-colored innards augment this unique brand of body horror humor.\n\n\nThe malleability of Puniru's design takes a step further beyond with her transformation ability, which bestows an incredible range of outfits over the course of the show. Much of this serves to elevate Puniru's cuteness, but it can also introduce more drastic switch-ups to her appearance, from the mature [Casino Puniru](https://files.catbox.moe/p4q69o.png), to the spiky [Evil Puniru](https://files.catbox.moe/cr12ng.png), to the anthropomorphic [Dragon Puniru](https://files.catbox.moe/ugw0qh.png), to just about anything else. Between this sky's-the-limit creativity and her inherent roundness being conducive for fun expressions, Puniru is a very effective driving force behind her show's punchlines. \n\n\nThe side cast is comparatively basic as they mainly rely on simple shapes and colors to key in their archetypal roles, with exceptions being [Kotarou's exaggerated reactions](https://files.catbox.moe/qyj0av.png) or [Mami's horror-coded body language](https://files.catbox.moe/yc1wck.png). Although this characterization can come off as relatively thin, they do their part allowing the comedy to place Puniru front and center. With her undeniable charm, Puniru easily steals a spot as a highlight in this year's character design. \n",

Character Designer Yukiko Nakatani brings out the appeal of these characters with her illustrative [elegance](https://i.imgur.com/ufH6jGY.png)\n and fun [expressiveness](https://i.imgur.com/7U4bACL.png). Combined with Misato Aida's [vibrant color design](https://i.imgur.com/1OcPzIx.png), the design work in *Kusuriya no Hitorigoto* showcases the charisma of its cast while also serving the narrative. At its center is Maomao, whose range of outfits and [chibi forms](https://i.imgur.com/oz90kI5.png) reflect her experiences with the opulence and the peonage of her society.\n\n\nMuch of the thematic and narrative focus centers the design language around social status, often delineated by their wardrobes. The most notable examples being the four high ranking consorts who each follow a color scheme themed after their titles. Each possesses the greatest amount of [detailing](https://i.imgur.com/0tX6ERq.jpeg) in their hair, accessories, and make-up. Their ladies-in-waiting follow the same respective color schemes, but less [color saturation](https://i.imgur.com/ci0i6hF.png) and detail denote their status. Visual details are particularly key; Maomao's internal monologues constantly make note of them, and they are usually relevant to the mystery at hand. Going down the ladder, lower officials and peasants eventually lose all distinguishing features: a contrast that reinforces the Inner Palace's opulence. [Jinshi's](https://i.imgur.com/fP8ZuJX.png) transformation into a [commoner](https://i.imgur.com/YTvsOkg.png) is another standout example of this approach. \n\n\nMaomao is the star. As the main character frequently moves between her world's social extremes, Maomao's designs also shift to adapt and survive. Her [cat](https://i.imgur.com/sDPpSiJ.png) and [chibi](https://i.imgur.com/sTrf6L9.png) forms endear the audience to her curious gremlin nature as well as mask her feelings and intentions from Jinshi without detracting from the visuals. Self-fashioned to never draw attention with her false freckles and modest attire, Maomao's design is [visually striking](https://i.imgur.com/MHU8qhL.png) nonetheless.

          "writeup": "*Girls Band Cry*'s production staff faced a challenge of adapting traditional hand drawn designs into CG without compromising their appeal. To overcome it, they use some innovative techniques, such as more dynamic lighting, thick linework that further emphasizes silhouettes, and advanced face rigs. The last one, with the help of Teshima Nari's hand drawn corrections, led to an unprecedented variety of facial expressions for Japanese CG anime. Every main cast member looks uniquely emotive, and even side characters receive their own distinct models, which makes the world of the show feel more alive. \n\n\nFurthermore, every band girl gets more than ten different sets of clothes, which not only reflect their personal tastes, but also convey story and character development at times. Nina's tagline t-shirts, Tomo's different ribbons, and Subaru deliberately unchanged school uniform add more individuality to their designs. \n\n\nOn the other hand, overall color work is uninspired. It focuses mostly on realism and practicality, rather than any symbolic significance. The baseline main character designs largely follow current girl band anime conventions, with Nina's pigtails being the most unique element. And despite how flexible the CG models are in motion, some quirkiness of Teshima Nari's illustrations is still lost in adaptation, making even hand-drawn parts of the show look quite bland in comparison.\n    \n\nRegardless, *Girls Band Cry*'s level of ambition is remarkable, achieving some great results. It steps up the possibilities of CGI character designs in anime and stands strong amongst the best of the year.\n",

          "writeup": "As a romantic comedy, *Make Heroine ga Oosugiru!* doesn't try to reinvent the wheel, but rather focus on familiar genre tropes and play around with them. Each has distinct features and silhouettes, and the soft color palette helps signature hair colors to pop. Characters also grouped around common elements to indicate their role in the story: shorter hair and [ahoge](https://files.catbox.moe/v6dcz4.png) for losing heroines; long, straight hair for winners; slim build for Nukumizu, contrasted with taller, more masculine winning boys.\n\n\nHowever, the biggest strength of the designs are their expressivity. Chief Animation Director Tetsuya Kawakami brought life to the characters with a wide variety of comedic reaction faces, which serve as natural reflection of individual personalities and never deform from the norm. The only exception is Episode 3, supervised by Hiroaki Gouda, where he simplified the designs to make them even more animation friendly. \n\n\n\nThe wardrobe elements are not as impressive. While the three bows uniform became a point of contention even inside the show itself, it still ended up being the most memorable cloth feature. The rest of the costumes are not as distinct, although they can be used to [accentuate specific jokes](https://imgur.com/bsIVAq5). There's also a bit of imbalance when it comes to a variety of expressions; Ana gets way more attention than the rest. \n\n\n*Makeine* is a good example of how stylistically standard designs with modern sensibilities can be pushed to another level by great animation directors, which make these losing girls win a lot of people's hearts. \n",

Kappe's corrections, which highlight the characters' [face](https://files.catbox.moe/s34tm5.png) and [hair](https://files.catbox.moe/9widk2.png) during closeups, bring a beautiful illustrative touch to the show's [climactic moments](https://files.catbox.moe/qwcv3u.png). However, the art's appeal [notably](https://files.catbox.moe/41r8mm.png) [dips](https://files.catbox.moe/s5cvas.png) outside of these moments, and in an effort to maintain such detailed appeal, the show sacrifices expressiveness in its animation. As with the first season, the leads' vibrant hair and star-eyes are double-edged swords - effective at signposting important characters or [plot developments](https://files.catbox.moe/szs316.png), but sometimes detracting from the experience by disrupting visual harmony.\n\n\n*Season 2* largely revolves around a stage play, which introduces an additional array of designs in both a new supporting cast and theatrical costumes. The costume designs with brighter color schemes successfully pull the characters into a different world on stage, while details in their eyes and bangs keep the actors underneath recognizable. As part of the star performers, Akane and Kana's costumes are a standout in this department: Akane's long, flowing robes create a dignified look that strongly contrasts with Kana's fierce ninja outfit. Their costumes also have different ranges of motion that are appropriate to the needs of the characters being portrayed, adding functionality in how costume design aids their stage performances. These new offerings, alongside Kappe's reiterated work, are sure to please any returning fan.\n",

          "writeup": "*Sousou no Frieren* isn't a show whose primary draw is its character designs, but nevertheless it executes them with care and precision. Character Designer Reiko Nagasawa faithfully adapted the designs, while keeping the detail restrained, so *Frieren* could showcase its exquisite scenes of animation.\n\n\nA highlight of *Frieren*'s outfits is their utmost practicality.  They have none of the excess belts and overcoats that many fantasy shows choose to use. *Frieren* instead opts for restrained designs like Fern's white dress and black cloak or Serie's plain robe with a single accessory. Frieren's party is on a long journey, and this practicality serves a purpose.\n\n\nThe character designs also demonstrate one of the core themes of the show: the passage of time.  Frieren herself is in a timeless bubble, but for characters like Fern, Eisen, and old man Voll, their growth or the appearance of age lines on their face reinforces the passage of time.\n\n\nThe show has a few basic monster designs, which, while well-executed, do not stray far from the trappings of classic fantasy designs. Additionally, characters such as Ubel break the rules of the world for dubious reasons.  She first appears in an impractical outfit and without any travel gear, seemingly unprepared for the harsh world of travel.\n\n\nUltimately, there isn't a lot to fault with *Frieren*, but neither does it push boundaries.  Its execution earns it a nomination, and it's not to be discounted.  The designs blend into a larger scope of storytelling, and *Frieren* wouldn't have become the instant classic that it is with anything less.\n",

Round faces, shaded contours and distinct side profiles are morphed for exaggeration and character transformations into their possessed, paranormal forms.\n\n\n\nMomo and Okarun fit squarely into character archetypes by their outfit selection and color design. Still, they remain distinct and differentiable through how they accessorize, as well as carrying a sense of body language in their posing that matches their personality. \n\n\nTheir ordinary constructions are contrasted by the paranormal monsters. With the unsettling elements in their morphology, they appear as if an evolution of their *Ultraman* influences: angular faces and body proportions, detailed limb constructions, and hair featuring grotesque mutilations of body parts. Those traits are shared through Okarun and Aira for transformations that match the specter that possesses them, Turbogranny and Acrobatic Silky, respectively.\n\n\nProblems arise with the choppiness of *Dandadan*'s animation direction. Drawings awkwardly vary between on-model and off-model given some of the show's schedule crunch and a lack of Character Designer Naoyuki Onda's touch to unify the look for each episode due to only correcting his designs at the start of the show. The problem is particularly present when simple actions exhibit variable profile shots for unintentional comedic breaks in tension. Additionally, most mob designs are much weaker and less memorable in comparison with the lead characters, which makes it less fruitful to compare and contrast outfit selection or shape language to distinguish what makes the leads stand out.\n\n\n*Dandadan* remains a fun take on yokai stories due to its invocation of science fiction and how this aids its ability to make discernable, idiosyncratic character expression.\n",

A wide range of characteristics and body shapes for each fantastical race creates a strong grasp of diversity in designs. This variety multiplies exponentially when combined with the cast's outfits, all of which take cues from their cultural origins. Distinctive silhouettes stand out from each other as well as underline the traits of different species. Laios's large stature communicates his character effectively with the framing of some shots emphasizing his frame, while Marcille's roundness lends itself to plenty of fun expressions.\n\nYuta Kaneko's monster designs provide a nice variety, from playful fantasy tropes like the treasure coin bugs to cool ones like the red dragon. Some monsters even change up the designs of the characters themselves, like the shapeshifters and the changelings.\n\nThe impeccable [shading](https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/9366d4137ed745b441830e1dfee34a7f.mp4) made the show more [kinetic](https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/8ebe3fb43c462bf3eaf11fbe2590236a.mp4), and the show doesn't shy away from [uglier expressions](https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/8ebe3fb43c462bf3eaf11fbe2590236a.mp4) to showcase a [wider range of emotions](https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/6fec92b3bc0a651b2dd7ed06e3d74448.mp4) and bring good laughs. *Dungeon Meshi* is more than willing to change up the design language during less comedic scenes, like during the Undine fight, where the designs become more angular and geometric for more kinetic action.\n\n*Dungeon Meshi* excels at all aspects.

It is a discipline built from both the technical knowledge of cinematic techniques and the artistry of knowing which technique is best suited for a particular series, scene, or moment.   Most of this year's shortlists and nominees were either realistic dramas with a cinematographic focus on character relationships and introspection or action-comedies with a focus on both exciting and comedic composition. Within these two overall trends, though, were many different visions for how to achieve them—*Hibike Euphonium*'s emphasis on body language and symbolic staging versus *Oshi no Ko*'s introspective and allegorical cutaways; *Bravern*'s satirical visual juxtapositions versus *Dungeon Meshi*'s toolbox of comedic transitions; *Dandadan*'s fast-moving, atmospheric action versus *Elusive Samurai*'s poetic art shifts. Meanwhile, *Monogatari* was being *Monogatari*.   This year also had a plethora of bold and imaginative color design choices, found in almost every nominee and many of our shortlists, too.   As always, there's no outright right or wrong artistic vision in cinematography—the jury focused on how each vision complemented and elevated the series, as well as recognizing novel composition and design.",

          "writeup": "*Katsute Mahou Shoujo to Aku wa Tekitai Shite Ita* excels in its use of lighting, color palette, and camera focus to create an intimate and romantic atmosphere. Usage of close-up shots and dim lighting creates a saccharine mood and puts the focus on the romantic leads. Striking compositions abound; for example, the alleyway scene uses ripples in the puddle reflections to vividly express Mira's anger. Visual symbolism is interlaced throughout the runtime. Various flowers provide a visual motif of the romance between the two leads, such as Byakuya mending Mira's jacket with a pink cosmos applique or the purity of the jasmine being corrupted in Bellatrix's twisted fantasy of Mira. A pink-and-blue color theme reinforces the romantic undertones in the various gifts that the lovebirds give to each other. In addition, the soft pastel colors and sensitive filmic blur create a soothing ambiance, enhancing the intimate atmosphere.\n\n\nIn contrast to the romance, the visual execution of the comedic scenes is unremarkable. Common usage of non-diegetic backgrounds, and repetitive visual gags such as Mira's glasses breaking feel limiting. The transition between gag comedy and romantic intimacy isn't always conveyed properly either. Regardless, the high quality and overall consistency of the show's visual direction with its expert camerawork, polished compositing, and sprinkled symbolism are sure to leave a magical impression.\n",

Likewise, the compositing is handled with utmost care; the shine for the [instruments](https://files.catbox.moe/7bntpl.png) is detailed from every angle, and the character art complements the intricate backgrounds very well. Vivid filters imbue meaning by helping the key moments feel distinctive for [tension](https://files.catbox.moe/c5eya2.png), [intimacy](https://files.catbox.moe/6dbb7t.png), or [flashback cues](https://files.catbox.moe/90efif.png). However, post-processing and light balance can sometimes be excessive, underplaying the show's naturalistic strengths.\n\n\nIn its necessity to reference previous material, *Hibike* is slightly restrained in its exploration of the setting and character staging. Notable exceptions such as Mayu encroaching on Kumiko's treasured place, or [Sally's episode](https://files.catbox.moe/i48elc.png) aptly stages its characters and utilizes the show's characteristic symbolic lighting. This is further coupled with the show's excursions across town that diversify its environment and showcases its compositing strength. Ultimately, the [final audition](https://files.catbox.moe/q2508f.png) shines as one of the season's culmination. Fully leveraging the show's excellent lighting, evocative [close-ups](https://files.catbox.moe/14ygwr.png), and is befitting of *Hibike*'s grand finale of a season.\n",

Rookie director Midori Yoshizawa takes the directorial reins over the series, keeping *Monogatari*'s identity intact while adding fresh visual ideas that help this season stand out.\n\n\nThe iconic visual language of the series is perfectly recaptured, with a wide array of visuals and quickly executed cuts creating a snappy pace that makes for consistently engaging scenes. This flashy style can be overwhelming, however, with the sheer number of different things that happen in quick succession. More specific callbacks to prior seasons are used effectively, including the use of real-life visuals, text inserts, and even recreated sequences.\n\n\n*Off & Monster Season* is split into four different arcs, and each is given a distinct visual identity to great effect. *Tsukihi Undo* utilizes bird-related imagery and *Nadeko Draw* heavily features manga-style visuals. *Acerola Bon Appétit*, directed by Akiyuki Shinbo, switches up the visual style entirely to one more inspired by gothic horror; the result is striking and unique, but leads to compositing issues between the characters and CG backgrounds. *Shinobu Mustard*, however, lacks distinct imagery to tie it together making it a step down compared to the rest of the show. Despite this, effective visual language is felt in its heightened use of text inserts and creative use of scenery by projecting images onto it.\n\n\nOverall, *Off & Monster Season* is packed to the brim with varied and exciting cinematic techniques, making for some of the most enthralling cinematography of the year.\n",

          "writeup": "*[Oshi no Ko] season 2* shines in its portrayals of passion, particularly through Melt and Akane's stage play moments and Kana's flashbacks. This is aided by the continued usage of the star motif established in the first season. The season further adds the crow as a visual motif which is used for foreshadowing while providing a striking allegory to Lucifer. Usage of POV shots of the audience during the stage play arc add a sense of immersion, though this is hindered by conflicting shot angles and overly long takes with little variation. \n\n\nThe season also suffers from numerous compositing and lighting issues. In particular, the desaturated colors are used too prevalently during indoor rehearsal scenes and lead to an bleak and depressing atmosphere with little light or color accents, which clashes with the more vibrant moments of the stage play arc. Sunlight scenes in Episode 11 also stand out due to the poorly applied filter. Usage of color does, however, stand out more positively as a tool for symbolism. The paint battle and character introductions in Episode 1 contrast the characters on a grey background, and the fun “POP IN 2” MV plays on the typical colorful nature of music videos by imbuing unfittingly dark undertones against bright, poppy visuals.\n\n\nWhile *Oshi no Ko season 2* suffers from a few poor aesthetic choices, its strong visual symbolism and highlight moments make it an outstanding nominee for the year.\n",

          "writeup": "Highly anticipated Shonen-Jump manga *Dandadan* marks the debut of Science Saru veteran Fūga Yamashiro on the director's chair. Every cinematic decision from the self-proclaimed film buff feels intentional, with a variety of different approaches being utilized to capture *Dandadan*'s unique mix of romance, comedy, action, and horror. Shots are often used to highlight body language and frame elements such as doorways, supporting the expression and relationships of the characters. Comedic scenes are kept fresh and exciting through varied camera angles and creative transitions. *Dandadan*'s [action sequences] (https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/ccfd8a0c8d95838f6384f833120e6fd1.mp4) also impress, with constant wide shots grounding a sense of orientation and signature color overlays used to signal the presence of a supernatural threat. The color overlays lead to a cool visual effect but did occasionally overstay their welcome for the longer fights in the later episodes. Instead of abrupt jumpscares to provide the horror element, a slower buildup of [tension and anticipation] (http://sakugabooru.com/data/42f71b76f32344d4a667b98fbb53fcbc.mp4) is applied to keep the viewer on their toes.  \n\n\nPerhaps *Dandadan*'s greatest feat was the presentation of Acrobatic Silky's backstory in Episode 7. The use of a [360-degree camera] (https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/18990551d006e2bd4d43808c46223a8a.mp4) shows the passage of time and also alludes to the spinning ballerina seen shortly after. The [POV shot] (https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/bc6f987007aacf32b8e8e4119f6d159a.mp4) of Silky running out of her apartment to look for her daughter was particularly powerful, as the shakiness of the camera sells the feeling of desperation and hopelessness that Silky was feeling at that moment in time. It's a remarkable achievement in a show that already stands as one of the year's most visually engaging. \n",

In contrast, dynamic action scenes utilize [expansive aerial shots](https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/53ae06b8aeb6410d5e522e7ab22d3711.mp4) and brusque cuts from [perspective shots](https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/23a31eaa76ca2b4459aef5a146a845de.mp4) to create memorable sequences.

Euphonium* series in stage performances, though each show grappled with challenges to elaborate on the band experience of high schoolers.   For the jury, *Dungeon Meshi* and *Monogatari: Off and Monster Season* especially set themselves apart from the rest of the nominees with their versatility, an unimpeded flow supporting both narrative and character exploration, and charm which truly immersed the viewer.

          "writeup": "The soundtrack for *Kinokoinu Mushroom Pup* was a surprising underdog amongst the big titles of the year. Focusing on atmospheric compositions, it weaves together traditional and experimental instrumentation to evoke themes of grief, loneliness, and hope. The soundtrack establishes a distinct identity, using a very ‘warm' soundscape that prominently features percussion, flute, theremin, and piano to amplify the series' emotional core.\n\nWith music present nearly continuously in every episode, the soundtrack could risk becoming overbearing, but its careful structuring and dynamic layering keep an effective accompaniment for the emotional arc in each episode. Tracks transition seamlessly, evolving over time rather than abruptly changing. Episode 9 exemplifies this, with the soundtrack ebbing in intensity to match the unfolding events, giving the show a fluid, dreamlike quality. In contrast, the comedic tracks have a much more ‘plucky' sound to them—often incorporating playful woodwinds, pizzicato strings, and bouncy percussion—to align with Kinokoinu's antics.\n\nWhile the soundtrack does an exemplary job with fitting the emotional arcs of the show, it is disappointing that nearly all of its individual pieces lack strong melodic or rhythmic hooks. While effective at evoking mood and reinforcing themes in the moment, the individual tracks don't leave a lasting musical impression.\n\nOverall, Kinokoinu delivers one of the most cohesive and emotionally resonant soundtracks of the year. Its varied instrumentation, strong layering, and deep integration within the story set a high standard for how a soundtrack can elevate storytelling—even if its individual tracks do not stand out on their own.",

          "writeup": "A calm vibe for a calm world. The soundtrack of *Bartender: Kami no Glass* uses a subtle approach to enhance the mood of each scene. The combination of classical, jazz, and lo-fi creates a relaxed ambience that characterizes the series. \n\nTracks like “Bloody Mary” establish the melancholy setting. These purely jazz pieces transport us to the seat at an upscale bar; it feels gentle and inviting. In contrast, the intensity of “Tender Consideration” and “A Secret Between Us” drive home the dramatic moments. The running melodies reach crescendos without ever overpowering a scene, however, the climactic moments felt underwhelming compared to other nominees.\n\n*Bartender* is a character driven series and the soundtrack gives us a great first impression of each new character. Instrumental and stylistic variation is emphasized as opposed to leitmotif use to  give a lasting impression to each patron that briefly interacts with the primary cast, helping episodes that have similar themes feel distinct.\n\nThis soundtrack largely features elegant lounge music, but it still has variety. While jazz and lo-fi are standard in scenes where we are introduced to a new location, classical orchestrations are the recurring choice for character moments. There are also a decent range of instruments featured, but too often the soundtrack falls back on piano melodies for any emotional scene.\n\nAll of this comes together to create a soundtrack that is subdued but thematically strong. Fitting as one of the top soundtracks of 2024, but is lacking in contrast to other shows with similar soundtrack usage. ",

The lavish electronic and cyberpunk soundscape mixed with synths and more traditional instrumentations created a unique, vibrant, and futuristic atmosphere that transports you into their world.\n\n\nThe soundtrack seamlessly matches the tone of the show providing: fantastic vocal insert tracks, a progressive and innovative take on electronic music, and also keeping more subdued character or thematic moments balanced with traditional pianos, strings, and woodwinds. The more ambient tracks played during slice-of-life scenes are relaxing and peaceful, but at a moment's notice we can switch to tense and thundering fight scenes which are scored in a way that amplifies the intensity and ferocity of these moments.\n\n\nDespite the frenetic energy and futuristic tone of the soundtrack, the biggest issue with the soundtrack is that it repeats the theme tracks a bit too frequently, drowning out the highlights of unique variations in other moments of the show. Some tracks also don't fit the scenes too well, with it sounding a bit awkward or obtuse at times, but that is rare. However, *Metallic Rouge* does a remarkable job of creating an engaging atmosphere, an unconventionally lively soundscape, while also not taking itself too seriously with bombastic battle tracks that just lighten up this ridiculous world they live in.",

This layering is deftly adapted tonally to emit a tinge of the mystery and magic involved in scenes, and provides an otherworldly touch alongside the ever-present suspense in exploring the vast dungeon. Woodwind usage is well-fitted to the chat and gossip between cast members in their adventuring, while brass orchestration in action scenes sensationalize a chivalrous, epic, and united effort of the parties in battle. True to the series' title, a recurring motif is explored enthusiastically in cooking scenes which keeps the audience engaged throughout.\n\nAs the series progresses, the soundtrack's ability to enhance the narrative becomes strikingly apparent.

The establishing tracks make wonderful use of this whenever Maomao visits new areas of the palace like “The Verdigris House” or extravagant events are thrown for the emperor.\n\n\nThe chilling implementation of silence throughout makes moments when tracks such as “Cold” drop all the more powerful. Even though the show's second half shifts instrumentation focus in new compositions to strings for establishing the tone, overall variation was lacking by the end where tracks like “Understanding the Situation” and “Lady-in-Waiting” are used in almost every episode. \n\n\nThe strengths of three different composers on the project—Satoru Kousaki, Kevin Penkin, and Alisa Okehazama—are brought together and exhibited masterfully. Kousaki's engaging slice-of-life tunes, such as “Maomao's Daily Life” and “Food Taster”, are played over many scenes and he additionally provided cathartic insert songs which connect with one another; at the perfect moments, Penkin's “Cold” and “Sadness” deliver a heartrending blow; and Okehazama's melodies created beautiful atmosphere and setting, namely “Fuyou” and “Swords Dance.”\n\n\n*Kusuriya no Hitorigoto*'s distinct sound both establishes and elevates the tone of each scene but unfortunately does not quite reach the heights felt by other nominees in the process.

However, this season fails to deliver on significant performative moments from the cast, despite exploring the legacy of the band members thematically. This is instead seen in the expression of the soundtrack's motifs that callback to performances of earlier entries, like “Crescent Moon Dance” or “Liz and the Blue Bird”.\n\n\nMoments such as Kumiko's march to school at the very start of the show are where the creative usage flows. This diegetic trait—featured in segments where specific instruments are isolated to represent the characters in the scene—accentuates the ambience of being in a concert band. Dramatic parts of the show tend to have strong build-up like “Tayutau Omoi” in Episode 8. Despite that, the prominent use of melancholic piano and strings in non-emotional scenes takes away from more important moments using similar instrumentation. Versatility during the slice of life portions would have made a big difference in terms of tonality. \n\n\nThis season had the potential to use what the show is about to elevate the final chapter of Kumiko's story in a much more meaningful way.",

TogeToge's songs and Nina's own musicality depict her raw, unfiltered emotions through jagged guitar riffs, aggressive drumming, and impassioned vocals. On top of this, the contrast between Nina's raw, emotionally expressive vocals and the more sterile, commercialized version of \"Void\" performed by Diamond Dust reinforces the show's broader themes of sincerity and artistic identity.\n\nUnfortunately the show is careless with background music, often filling moments with quirky and dramatic energy when they could have benefited from a more contemplative tone. In some scenes this creates a tonal dissonance that detracts from the intended atmosphere. While the performances themselves remain a highlight, the overall style does not evolve meaningfully over time, making it feel somewhat repetitive by the end despite the distinct style.\n\nAmongst its flaws, *Girls Band Cry* has a soundtrack that at its best compellingly embodies the raw artistic emotion and struggle at the heart of the story. The strong performances elevate it beyond a mere collection of background tracks, even if its shortcomings ultimately hold it back from alongside the very best this year.",

          "writeup": "The soundtrack of *Dandadan* earns its place among nominees this year by letting Kensuke Ushio do what he does best - crafting hypnotizingly good electronic tracks, which in this case perfectly complement the wild antics of the cast. It embraces an eclectic approach, incorporating vocal elements in unique ways with standout tracks like “Spoken Spell” and “Paranormal Funk”, but also delivering undeniable bangers like “Tiger and Flower”. The music does an excellent job of matching the show's wacky, unpredictable tone while building an otherworldly soundscape that reflects the overt alien theming at the heart of the story. On top of the energy the soundtrack is able to bring, it also knows when to pull back, with tracks like “Love Theme” which use stripped-down instrumentation to heighten emotional moments, making them hit even harder in contrast to the rest of the electronic-heavy soundtrack. \n\nDespite these strengths, the soundtrack sometimes lacks a strong overarching identity or well-developed leitmotifs, especially when compared with other standout scores from the year. Additionally, the frequent reuse of tracks in the final stretch leads to a sense of stagnation, offering little in the way of fresh musical ideas. While the soundtrack undoubtedly excels in bringing energy, the cohesiveness of the entire product leaves room for debate.",

Heavy in strings and woodwinds, Evan Call's soundtrack captures the thrill of intense action, the magnificence of an expansive landscape, and a melancholy outlook on the passage of time.\n\n\nThe highlight of *Frieren*'s action music is the \"Zoltraak\" theme. Fast-paced vocals and woodwinds immediately invoke a feeling of excitement for the accompanying battles. Throughout *Frieren*, \"Zoltraak\" and the closely related non-vocal \"Evolution of Magic\" further emphasize the growing magical ability of Fern and the human race. Climactic moments reach their peaks with the tracks \"Frieren the Slayer,\" \"Demon's Bane,\" and \"Knife to the Throat\", each conveying an epic grandeur unseen in most nominees.\n\n\n*Frieren*'s soundtrack also beautifully complements the atmosphere and sense of adventure with the calm \"Time Flows Ever Onward\" and grand emotional swells like those found in \"Where the Blue-Moon Weed Grows\" and \"Beyond the Journey's End.\" A shortfall with the soundtrack is that it sometimes leans a little *too* grand, creating a disconnect between what is heard and what is happening on-screen.\n\n\nCalm moments are generally handled quite well, and the theme of the passage of time gets special attention. \"Mirrored Lotus\" and \"Great Mage Flamme,\" for instance, are powerful, touching pieces, evoking a sense of nostalgia for a time long past.\n\n\nOverall, this expert blend of majesty and sadness makes *Frieren*'s soundtrack one of the best of the year.",

Minimal, haunting piano and discordant strings are underscored by pulsing synthetic textures, mirroring the dread immuring her.

In short, all 10 final nominations were performances that excited the jury. On one hand, there were astonishingly compelling performances by industry rookies like Rina, Fuuka Izumi, and Hina Youmiya. On the other hand, veterans like Hikasa Yoko, who are more commonly seen in supporting roles these days, got their chance to show off their experience and prowess as main characters. In short, there was no shortage of excellence for the jury to highlight.   While each nomination this year had standout marquee moments, the jury’s evaluation is focused on overall voice acting, and every scene was listened to and assessed in order to fairly and effectively evaluate the quality of the entire performance. Every breath, tone, inflection, nasality, and technique must fit the context of the scene and be aligned to the voice profile of the character and their character arc. Through this rigorous assessment, the jury can confidently say that all the nominees this year are worthy of being highlighted for their creativity, effort, devotion to their characters, and passion for their craft.",

Ayano was a challenging character to tackle: plenty of screentime, emotional temperature swings that go all over the place, and the show's static character animation were all tests to Hikasa's ability to elevate *Murai in Love* and bring additional energy to scenes. Her exaggerated enunciations when expressing passion, embarrassment, sadness and pure joy, were sparks that brought life to the show.\n\n\nHikasa is extremely funny during comedic scenes, handling moments with creativity and innovation. Ayano's overly feminine and “classic otaku talk” is hilarious when fantasizing about Hitotose, her inflections are adorable when being embarrassed by Murai, and her slightly delinquent persona constantly comes through with her tone and tongue clicks.\n\n\nSurprisingly, in a mostly comedy series, Ayano's emotionally heavy scenes, especially in the last quarter of the show, are delivered with what can only described as genuine honesty, almost as if Hikasa puts down all the quirks she developed for the character, and lays her feelings bare with no pretense, much like Ayano herself at the end of the show.\n\n\nOverall it was an incredible performance, displaying masterful tone and vocal technique with inventive variations, that results in perhaps the best role in Hikasa's already lauded career, and certainly goes toe-to-toe with past winners of the Best Voice Acting category.",

Hina's soft, affectionate tone gives the character a hypnotic quality. \n\n\nHina brings some variety to the role, changing up her voice as Yamada reacts to different characters. In addition to playful moments, she also shines in dramatic scenes, giving more depth to Anna; Anna's breakdown while alone with Ichikawa is so gut wrenching because Hina makes her tears sound real. However, she feels stiff at times as well, and as a result some moments, especially jokes, do not land well. Even in some dramatic moments, Hina conveys passion effectively, but lacks subtlety compared to the best performances in reacting to subtly different dramatic moments. \n\n\nHowever, Anna Yamada is a romantic character first and foremost, and Hina sells the budding relationship in the series well. From the small reactions she gives, to her audible breathwork, to the difference in the quality of her voice in scenes with Ichikawa, all these elements create the sense of a young girl in love.\nAn impressive display, Hina's unique approach helps Anna Yamada feel like an authentic person. However, while she is consistent, her comedic scenes are not as strong as some of the nominees above her. Her awkward delivery and lack of variety held back this performance from similar peaks in first season.",

What better way to sound like a VTuber than to become one? Through Kadokawa, Ayane made her own VTuber debut as Awayuki on Youtube, including a collaboration skit with Yuu Kobayashi, voice of Utsuki Sei, and an actual VTuber collaboration with Houshou Marine of Hololive productions. Baptized into the digital waters of VTubing, Ayane was fully equipped to deliver an authentic VTuber performance.\n\n\nAyane slides seamlessly into character as a sleazy goofball trying to moonlight as a pure and unadulterated idol. The contrast between these two personalities is highlighted by the voice performance, especially when Awayuki flip-flops between her two modes like a fish out of *Strong Zero*. The theatrics and exaggerated antics of the first episode are particularly noteworthy, as Ayane leads us on Ms. Shuwa's Wild Ride through the five stages of grief and embarrassment after Awayuki is exposed on stream.\n\n\nHowever, Ayane's performance never truly rises above that high in either energy or passion. While the comedy stays enjoyable and the fun drunk moments stay bubbly, the unchanging nature of the performance leans towards repetitiveness, like drinking the same flavor of *Strong Zero* every day.\n\n\nAlthough Awayuki did not become a voice acting legend this year, Ayane, already a voice acting legend herself, should still be commended for her commitment to the honest hard work of VTubing.",

This energy shines as a result of Uchida's impressive ability to convey Sunraku's exhaustion, strain, and exhilaration through his vocal performance and breathwork, fully capturing the physical intensity of the battles in *Shangri-la Frontier*. Even in quieter moments, the contrast between Sunraku's normal fiery, over-the-top enthusiasm, and the detached, ‘straight man' tone he takes in real life adds layers to his characterization. \n\n\nWhile Sunraku's performance excels in energy and comedic timing, his emotional range, though solid, falls slightly short compared to other nominees. In particular, his final scene with Weathermon lacks the cathartic emotional weight expected from such a climactic moment. Additionally, while Uchida's comedic timing is excellent, a good amount of the show's humor relies on a similar style of frantic delivery, with certain jokes hence feeling less varied over time.\n\n\nUltimately though, Uchida impressively delivers a high level of energy and expressiveness in each episode, even managing to make the most information-heavy exposition feel engaging and natural. His outstanding breath control, technical precision, and sheer passion make his portrayal one of the most consistently engaging of the year, earning him a well-deserved spot among the top performances.",

This was vital to her performance as the plot primarily focuses on Kumiko under the pressure of being club president. \n\n\nNew additions to the cast meant that Kurosawa had to develop character dynamics that sounded as genuine as those already established. While she tackles all the relationships gracefully, this season features one of the most compelling with the emergence of Mayu. Kurosawa really sells the frustration and annoyances Kumiko harbors towards Mayu, while trying to simultaneously uphold her duty of being an empathetic president. Viewers can almost hear her reach a boiling point in each scene Kumiko and Mayu share. Kumiko's relationship with Reina continues strong as their familiarity is illustrated by how bluntly Kumiko speaks to her, and the sarcasm that comes off as her voice dips. This duo also shares one of the best dramatic voice acting displays of the year in episode 12, with textures in Kurosawa's voice communicating vulnerability and anguish.\n\n\nWith all this said, the latest season is extremely heavy on drama, hence not allowing Kurosawa to be as dynamic as other nominees. The wonderful Kumiko noises are still there to show off her nuanced sound effects and nonverbal cues, but the tension in some scenes deflates the realism in her voice acting.",

Anna is a character that changes her emotions at the drop of a hat, but Tono never misses a beat, with her fast-paced, enthusiastic delivery firmly establishing Anna as the comedic center of *Makeine: Too Many Losing Heroines*.\nTono's over-the-top style feels straight out of a slapstick comedy with her high energy and physical delivery, and she immediately steals the spotlight anytime Anna is onscreen. However, she also plays well off of every other character in the series, making every relationship, friendly or romantic, feel distinct. Whether she is uniting her fellow failed lovers or making a fool of herself, Tono gives every line a charming inflection. She also lands every joke with excellent timing, cementing Anna's place as the funniest character in the series.\n\n\nOn the other hand, when Yanami has her serious moments, Tono sells her heartfelt emotions as well, adding complexity to the character in her vulnerable moments; her scene on the school rooftop is a particular highlight of the series. However, she shines more in the first half of the series than she does in some of the later episodes.\nOverall, Tono is a delight to watch from the start. While her performance in *Makeine* does not exhibit the same emotional depth as the finest performances of 2024, for her earnest approach and hilarious intensity, it still ranks highly among her peers. \n",

          "writeup": "Shion Wakayama revealed in an interview that she had never raised her voice nor shouted in an episode before stepping into this role. Even with this relative inexperience, she did not miss a beat playing the rambunctious gyaru. Her comedic timing was excellent, with great moments such as Ken Takakura's name being uttered causing her to be lovestruck, or the iconic “HUH” whenever Okarun says something ridiculous. Her range is one of the best parts of her performance, with her default coarse voice making Momo's strains and high-pitched inflections all the more impactful. The exuberant laughter she lets out frequently also sounds extremely genuine, especially with the voice cracks.\n\n\nDespite her extensive range, Wakayama tends to fall back on her gyaru voice, and intimate moments between Momo and Okarun being few and far between make her day-to-day execution feel rather more predictable. Wakayama does however capitalize whenever those scenes do come around, showcasing some nuance with her breathwork evoking Momo's vulnerability. \n\n\nWakayama and Hanae Natsuki form an infectious duo in *Dandadan*. Their dynamic constantly switches as each individual alternates between the funny and straight man to create a more robust performance. Aira's arrival  as a romantic rival demonstrates another facet of Wakayama's comedic proficiency with Momo and Aira's hostile nature towards each other as they vie for Okarun's attention. \n\n\nOverall, Wakayama's energy matches the absurd scenarios of *Dandadan* and elevates the anime along with the rest of the cast. However, the lively performance loses its luster with no meaningful growth throughout the show's runtime.",

Yuuki is not an unknown name for many anime fans, being a prominent actress with many remarkable roles. MaoMao, however, seems like a role that was designed almost specifically and perfectly for her, due to Yuuki's versatility and allure.\n\n\nMaomao's gigantic screen time inherently imposes a challenge to keep the character fresh and interesting with so much treatment, *Kusuriya no Hitorigoto* heavily relied on MaoMao's character as a core part of the appeal and, more importantly, ability to retain the viewer's interest, meaning that Yuuki's performance had to be charming and engaging constantly.\n\n\nYuuki makes internal monologues and boring exposition interesting, showcases a range of emotions in a believable and yet interesting manner, transmits physicality and charisma through small details like breathing and coughing, while upping the intensity during pivotal scenes. From her excited giggles and maniacal laughter when trying new poisons, to the powerful and frightening tone she conveys when first dealing with Lakan, to the boredom of her sighs, that sound almost physically painful, when she gets dragged into Jinshi's political problems, Yuuki nails all of those MaoMao moments with excellency, and just as importantly, with consistency.\n\n\nBy doing all of that and more, with a perfect blend of technical expertise and natural flair, Aoi Yuuki gave one of the best vocal performances of the last few years.",

Hasegawa however never abandons Masaki’s innate quirks present throughout the show: even though it's a “confession” scene, Masaki still has an awkward tone, as if she herself is not so sure about what she wants to say. More importantly, her aggressiveness, tongue clicks, asperity, are all still there, underlying every phrase she lets out. Hasegawa makes it clear with just her acting how angry Masaki is with herself for being in that situation. The entire episode is a treat with Hasegawa bringing forth a top notch performance to portray the roller coaster of emotions Masaki goes through, but this scene is the climax of the entire show, and Hasegawa absolutely nails it.

Directing, animation, music, storytelling, art and creativity are packed into a 90-second sequence. When done well these 90 seconds can be an amazing showcase of production capabilities, an intriguing mix of out-of-the-box ideas that frames the show in a completely new way, or a highly immersive mood piece that engulfs you into the tone and atmosphere of the series. The beautiful thing about OPs is that each year guarantees a mix of artistry within and between them and a new set of challenges to rank them.       This year provided an unusual mix of OPs with varied purposes, themes, and aesthetics. The top four for the jury—“Otozure”, “Caramel Ribbon Cursetard”, “Otonoke”, “ASSU!”—featured some of the best OPs in recent memory and were comfortably held in the highest regards by the jury. However, even in a highly competitive year with multiple fantastic entries there was clear and early consensus that the jury’s winner was going to be *One Piece*’s “ASSU!”.   The nominees outside of the top four were still meritorious, delivering their own distinct ideas, styles or atmosphere effectively and left other potential nominees like “Laid-back Journey” (*Yuru Camp*), ”Seishun no Archive” (*Blue Archive*) and “Kyoushinsha no Parade” (*Kuroshitsuji*) as mere honorable mentions.

It was initially overshadowed by other shortlists that clamored for attention with flashy visuals and chart-topping tunes, but over time its nostalgic character and unexpected attention to detail allowed the opening to rise through the ranks.\n\n\nThe “doki-doki” lyrics that begin the song immediately give the vibes of a wholesome romantic comedy.  Each character does a simple dance move that adds fun and whimsy. The characters are all featured several times in the opening, and the bubbly character animation gives the characters vitality and personality.\n\n\nMira shows up several times in cuts styled like pop art posters straight out of the 60's and 70's.  The psychedelic array of color at 1:00 is reminiscent of hippie culture as well. All these elements further reinforce the nostalgic feeling that a long-time anime watcher might have for shows from their childhood.\n\n\nStill, while “Hohoemi Note” is a really comfy opening, the scenes aren't the most novel—settings mostly show the characters in normal scenarios, tending to lean towards unstylized renderings of them. The integration between the music and visuals is lacking as well, meandering between settings with the phrases changing haphazardly. Nevertheless, it is a solid finish for an easily overlooked opening.",

          "writeup": "“Sweet Memory” offers a crisp and clean nostalgic experience that does a solid job of expressing some fundamental characteristics of *Shoushimin Series*. Keisuke Hiroe's directorial approach is fairly evident, delivering what could be described as a typical high school slice-of-life-esque opening, yet adds elements of intrigue through visual flairs such as the whimsical animal sequences. The cool blue tone across the entire opening provides a relaxing and chill vibe, while saturated and flashy dessert pop-ins provide some energy to all the presumed standardness. The segmented approach to the two main characters, particularly how they appear separated initially but then together in the more surreal sequences, highlights some key thematic elements regarding the kinds of characters these two are.\n\n\nHowever, the pacing may not feel as engaging as other nominees, and the animal elements can certainly cause confusion when connecting back to the show. Eve's vocal performance feels a bit more elevated compared to their typical work, complementing the instrumentation and music well. Despite this, the melancholic song can occasionally push back against the more exciting sequences. Beyond these moments, many visual stretches which offer great character acting snippets, as well as some engaging visual effect and background animation work, result in an audio-visual experience that feels well-executed and offers a few layers to dig through. \n\n\nThe relatively reserved and typical nature may not appeal to everyone, but many are sure to find “Sweet Memory” reflects the series nicely, with many engaging facets to be enjoyed even after multiple viewings.",

          "writeup": "“Otozure” is a depiction of the complex feelings that Yuki goes through, trying to adjust to life as a live-in maid for Hitoyoshi. The odd-meter rhythms of Tricot weave a web of emotions and moods as Saho Nanjou masterfully dictates these ideas through a medley of mixed media and careful use of subtractive elements. “Otozure” precisely uses negative spacing to highlight the isolation Yuki feels from her past and her self-doubt towards fitting in. These elements are expanded when transitioning to a new idea such as photogrammetry to summarize her chores as a maid or shadow puppetry to depict not having control of her actions.\n\n\nDespite how diligently the arrangement of the different media elements are edited together, some constructions (live action segments, rotoscoped part, cut-out animation) needed clearer backgrounds or a stronger usage of color contrast in order for the whole segment to feel more cohesive with the rest of the opening.\n\n\nNonetheless, the way “Otozure” utilizes repeated motifs as a call-response mechanism between Yuki and Hitoyoshi is also laudable for the way in which it breaks the prior established themes to brighten up the atmosphere: Hitoyoshi pulling Yuki out of the isolationist spotlight, flowers growing beneath them to represent their growing fondness, and getting a clear look at Yuki's face all contribute to this idea of the harmony between the two. Its unique aesthetic and vision make “Otozure” a one-of-a-kind treat. ",

          "writeup": "“Caramel Ribbon Cursetard” matches a simple childlike song with playful versions of the Monogatari characters to create an OP that is joyful to watch. Visually and musically, the OP is bright, peppy and comedic as many identical, cloned characters play together.\n\nThe OP's animation is exceptional. Even with several clones in view, each is given a unique animation. Attention is put into small details like the way a pen twirls, the way a dress sways, and the way a character's head bobs while juggling. Also seen are intimate character animations such as two characters playing hand imitations.\n\nThe carnival-like music features a synth horn playing an upbeat pattern, meshing with the theme of children's games. The OP has great moments where the animation and music are synchronized, like when walking to the beat, and one pulling another synchronized with the music's glissando. When the song's tempo slows, the animation likewise slows, as seen during the cat's cradle game sequence.\n\nThe visuals explore Nadeko's growth, who by playing games with child versions of herself, accepts her coming of age. Fans of the series will notice the similarities in musical structure to the song “Renai Circulation”, a song used in a previous season's OP.  While clearly a callback to the prior song, “Cursetard” never feels like a rehash.\n\nOne shortfall are instances of looped animation. This is a minor lapse in a beautiful OP which successfully combines animation, music, and whimsy to present familiar characters in a playful, charming vignette. ",

The wide cast of characters are all seen interacting with them in well-animated sequences, from Anna and Lemon squeezing through them to the side characters headbutting them up and down. These interactions make the world of the opening feel alive and bursting with energy.\n\n\nThe music and the color design contribute to the high energy as well. Blaring horns, high-pitched vocals, and the repetition of ‘make' create an earworm that can't get out of your head. Meanwhile, the color design complements the lively animation and poppy track through its pastel aesthetic. In particular, the use of a variety of blue hues contributes to the feelings of youthfulness in the opening.\n\n\nHowever, the opening has some minor drawbacks that leaves it just like the heroines in the show: losing. The overabundance of bright polygons in primarily the first half of the opening makes everything seem too busy and detracts from the opening's great color design, whilst the montage of camera pans and zoomed-in still images during the chorus is also jarring compared to how animated the rest of the opening is.\n\n\nDespite these drawbacks, “Tsuyogaru Girl”'s creative credits integration, bright aesthetic, and high energy song remain an absolute bundle of fun and one of the strongest openings of the year.",

Megumi Ishitani's iconic blend of creative and varied settings that convey character personality - along with great direction and simple shot composition - ease the rush from the OP's fast pace.\n\n\nFrom characters showcased through fighting game-esque selection screens, to letterboxed shots with characters' arms popping out of the frame, ”Assu!” is filled with quick cuts of creative, expressive animation that keep the viewer constantly engaged. The sequence of Luffy and the cast walking across different eras, with their outfits and shadows changing as they transition between them, was a standout moment that not only beautifully encapsulates the journey leading up to now, but is just one of many examples of small animation details flourishing character flair that are easy to miss. \n\n\nWith the OP's quick pace, match cuts and visual effects are skillfully utilized to link shots together and bring cohesion to the high density of the visuals. The lack of shading on character models and the bold color palette also work to simplify the art for easier interpretation.\n\nThese elements, in combination with a brisk tempo set by the drums and trumpet and the soaring highs of the vocals, work together to make “Assu!” more than just an energetic, near-flawless opening.

The animation achieves a dark and somber tone, featuring characters posing against a gritty urban background and gray skies, and imagery like the crow girl and a skeleton reanimating as Aqua in Gorou's clothes. Appearances of Ai bookend the main part of the OP—hinting at how memories of her still drive events.\n\n\nCuts of dynamic animation from the stage play add a welcome jolt of energy, though more such references would have strengthened the opening's narrative tie-ins. Instead, the opening is dragged down by several sequences that are just character cameos, both at the beginning where they are at least staged somewhat dramatically, and at the end when they just stand and pose for the audience in costume.\n\n\nThe song, \"Fatale\" by the duo Gemn, is not the unqualified success of last season's “Idol” by Yoasobi. It is high energy, but still manages to fit the brooding tone of the opening's animation.  Both the music and singing feature several shifts in style which the animation struggles to keep up. It does make use of an interesting mix of traditional Japanese instruments with more modern sounds.\n\n\nThe year was crowded with excellent openings that made bolder choices, so it is difficult for “Fatal” to stand out against such strong competition. Nethertheless it is a polished opening with a memorable song and worthy of its nomination this year.",

The opening combines many sequences that don't feel meaningful on their own, but bringing them all together contributes to giving a generally rebellious attitude befitting of the characters. \n\n\nThere are missteps among the polished cuts, ranging from an attempt at lip sync that doesn't match the vocals well, to the lightning effects at the start not adding to the experience besides looking cool. Having CGI for parts of the animation is jarring and slows the stage section more than desired.

          "writeup": "“Haru,” directed by Keiichirou Saitou, improves upon last cour's opening with striking visuals utilizing a bold use of colors, strong themes, and well-animated cuts—further complemented by a more fitting song. \n\nThe highlight of this opening is the chorus which showcases characters from the Mage's Exam arc, most notably Denken dodging attacks over a mountain backdrop. Serie's scene is equally striking, using a bold, monochromatic yellow to highlight the lineart and shifting architectural elements to convey her unchanging nature in an ever-evolving world. Complementing these visuals, Yorushika's “Haru” begins with a relaxed, simpler intro that reflects the series' tone before building into a powerful chorus. Its composition and escalating vocals align with the more action-focused Mage's Exam arc, enhancing the visuals with matching energy.\n\nDespite these strengths, the opening is not consistently this impressive. For instance, the early parts of the opening look jarring as the monochromatic shots featuring Frieren and Fern meld with the next scene. Additionally, the sequences feel disjointed, shifting between characters without a clear throughline to resemble a clipshow. The chorus stands apart narratively, highlighting the Mage's Exam cast in unrelated combat which contrasts with the intro and outro centering on Frieren. This imbalance creates a lack of cohesion as it struggles to juggle the main character and supporting cast.\n\nEven with these shortcomings, “Haru” manages to capture Frieren's character and the Mage's Exam arc with its music and visuals to create a memorable opening.",

With unique character cards highlighting everyone's personality; a frenetic, high-octane energy matched by vocals and instrumentation; and a color palette that contrasts the characters excellently against the backgrounds, this is one you won't want to miss.\n\n\nOne of the most striking aspects of “Otonoke” is its fluid animation and dynamic camera work. Rapid cuts and impeccable imagery are peppered alongside distorted perspectives with a kineticism that mirrors the pace of the music and anime. Like the show, sequences shift between traditional animation and drawing techniques, contrasting to raw, thick black lines which amplify movement and intensity of motion. Each shot bursts with color and exaggerated expressions, reflecting the unhinged energy of the characters and their supernatural encounters. The use of bold lighting effects and eerie imagery, such as glowing spirits and grotesque alien designs, highlight the series' fusion of horror and sci-fi elements. The vocals match the tone of the OP excellently, lead in by one of the catchiest hooks of the year.\n\n\t\nThis OP has a wonderful art style and aesthetic with a fantastic backing track, but some of the middle of the OP drags a bit of the momentum down. With that being said, the characters have incredible energy and it is just a treat to watch, capturing the chaotic and unpredictable nature of the series while keeping the viewer's attention.",

        "blurb": "Good Endings tend to get a lot less attention compared to the general love for a good Opening. By the time an episode wraps up, viewers often want to wind down from its energy. As a result, EDs generally have a calmer, more understated quality that makes them easier to skip. This leads to a lot of EDs that are nothing more than slideshows or scrolling credits, doing little to stand out from the pack; rather, they’re content with simply functioning as a mood piece to close out an episode. It makes selecting nominees a lot more difficult, but luckily there’s always a good few EDs that manage to find beauty in simplicity, or eschew it entirely for the better.    Both near the bottom and the top, the race was close. The last few nominees barely made it in over other considerations such as the charming “Anta Nante” (*Ranma ½*) or the buttery-smooth “Falling Up” (*Kami no Tou*). However, when compared to some of our stronger nominees it became salient which aspects held them back from placing higher. “Burning” lacks unique flair when it comes to its visual elements, and “Taidada” suffers from monotony caused by the reusing of cuts and a comparative lack of interesting ideas. At the top “CRAZY FOR YOU” and “Because” had a tense race for first place, with the former ultimately coming out slightly favoured and cementing itself as the ninth winner of Best ED in these awards, thanks to its incredibly imaginative self-contained narrative that re-imagines Lemon’s character and its expressive and colourful design work.

As a follow up to Taijima's previous work on live-action EDs, like *Sarazanmai*'s \"Stand By Me\", the greater use of color design and lighting to seamlessly blend characters into the environment feels like a natural evolution of their style.\n\n\nThe meticulous attention to detail is evident throughout, with shifts in lighting following the progression in time of day, while brightly-captured colors lend a significant amount of charm to the locales being visited. The way these elements interact with each other is taken into consideration as well, as an excellent balance of warmer and cooler colors accentuates how light bounces off of scenery. Shadows of the characters are also carefully placed throughout and further contribute to the ED's excellent composition. Complementing the visuals, the guitar strings of ammo's track bring a groovy energy to the ED.\n\n\nDespite this, \"Itokenai\" is a work that puts its scenic photography at the forefront. As such, the actual character animation takes a backseat, which can feel at odds for an ED centered around the lives of said characters. Nevertheless, the tremendous craft involved to seamlessly incorporate 2D and live-action visuals in \"Itokenai\" makes for a standout ED experience.",

          "writeup": "*Blue Archive* makes a repeated point of the characters being your average high school girls despite the absurd scenario they're in, and “Mahiru no Sora no Tsuki” plays into that idea wonderfully. \n\n\nOne of the ED's main draws is its strong cinematography. The majority of the ED is shot as if taken from one of the character's phones, immersing the viewer in the carefree nature of the slice-of-life vignettes. Stunning animation and lighting add to the experience, with moments such as Ayane descending the dark stairs, where the weight of each step is emphasized by the shifting light across her profile. The chorus provides another great example of this, as the POV perspective and the expressive animation work in tandem to showcase the cast's personalities. Unfortunately, the visuals during this section constantly fade into each other which—combined with messy credit placement—detracts from the readability of the underlying animation. Despite this, the fading technique contributes to the idea of visual unity, reinforcing one of the ED's central themes of friendship.\n\n\nThe music is another strong point that contributes toward this theme. The initial synth composition, reminiscent of older pop songs, immediately sets a relaxing, nostalgic tone. Having each of the characters sing over their segments reinforces the sense of camaraderie. Combined with the expressiveness of the character acting and the intimate camera angles, “Mahiru no Sora no Tsuki” easily earns its place among the best EDs of the year.",

It's nearly crafted as one continuous camera cut through morphing animation, seamlessly flowing between ideas whenever it transitions from one part to another. The pencil-like aesthetic and simple structure of the ending work in tandem with Tei's soothing vocals to highlight Ivy's journey as a tamer in a somber yet uplifting manner.\n\n\nThe ED's capability to depict Ivy's sorrow at her underlying weakness, swiftly showcase her ability to overcome that struggle, and convey her profound happiness upon gaining her companion, Sora, is a masterclass in emotional storytelling. It doesn't need to linger on the sadness at the start of her journey, because the pure energy of the piece is directed towards Ivy and Sora's harmonious companionship. The grass fields and stormy waters depict vignettes of the two and their unwavering bond in the face of adversity on their long road ahead. \n\n\nHowever, the grass plains they traverse are an example of where the ED's approach to background line weights and coloring make Ivy's movements feel floaty, slightly undercutting an otherwise well-executed sequence. Despite this, “Because” is a standout ED for how it's able to communicate raw emotion in a clear and resonant manner, thanks to its succinct storytelling, captivating transitions, and expressive movement.",

          "writeup": "In stark contrast to *Make Heroine ga Oosugiru!*'s more upbeat EDs, “Feel My Soul” provides a delicate glance into Komari's introversion and temperament through Kiiro Aose's direction and a fitting washed-out watercolor aesthetic. \n\n\nThe theme takes an interesting and almost candid approach, as if we are quietly observing Komari go about her day rather than watching her perform for the camera. This sense of detachment is further emphasized by her portrayal as a background character in her own ED, with classmates passing her by, paying no attention. Further, quick cut vignettes in the latter half of the ED–such as Komari being startled by a cat–do a remarkable job at showcasing her character through bite-sized intimate moments. Despite this, some felt that the ED was an oversimplification of Komari's debilitating social anxiety and is too optimistic in its depiction juxtaposed against the harsh reality of the show.\n\n\nThat being said, crafting an ED that effectively conveys introversion is a difficult balancing act of keeping things visually intriguing without making it feel too dynamic or energetic. A standout element in bringing this balance to life is the ED's striking use of color. Much of the palette is grounded in melancholic blue hues, yet gradually blends in warmer tones, adding a subtle but meaningful sense of hope that parallels Komari's character arc. This interplay also mirrors the song's tone - soft and reflective but ultimately optimistic. “Feel my soul” masterfully captures this essence, staying true to Komari's quiet nature, but bringing an encouraging throughline to the forefront.",

          "writeup": "It's rare for an ending theme to break away from the usual patterns of intricate animation and soaring melodies. \"Henshuu-Ten\" from *Mayonaka Punch* takes an unconventional approach, blending spoken word with a deliberate, leisurely tempo. Over half the song unfolds as a stream of soft musings, while the animation mirrors this restraint, moving at a slower rhythm that feels more reflective than flashy. Minimalist animation can often work against an ending sequence, but here it becomes a strength. The subdued tone of the visuals perfectly complements the song's laid-back atmosphere.\n\n\n“Henshuu-Ten” consists of a few vignettes of everyday life shot through the lens of social media, tying back to the series' themes. Scenes such as recording a reel or watching a drawing be animated provide variety, making the ED feel like a compilation of media. This all being set to the vocalist talking about their thoughts creates an overarching sense of ideas in motion. However, there is no connection between the segments, leading to a meandering feeling that some may not appreciate.\n\n\nThe unique nature of “Henshuu-Ten” helps it stand out from the crowd. While there may not be much happening on the surface, the constant movement in small moments and the seamless flow of ideas are captivating. Simple can work wonders when executed thoughtfully, and having a relaxed ending that offers a breather from the drama of real life feels just right.",

          "writeup": "Vibrant and rich with meaning, *Make Heroine ga Oosugiru*'s second ending, “CRAZY FOR YOU”, presents a poignant “what if” scenario centered on one of the series' unfortunate ‘losers' — Lemon Yakishio. Director Akihito Sudou's self-contained narrative approach offers an interesting glimpse into Lemon's dreams. It utilizes starry night sky and space-related visuals, symbolizing fate and the idea of a ‘destined partner', reinforcing the show's romantic themes while also offering an impressively creative and saturated aesthetic to the ending. “CRAZY FOR YOU” also depicts a unique interpretation of the “waiting for their prince charming” trope through the use of cryogenic pods, detailing a set arrival time for Lemon's hopeful knight in shining armour. \n\n\nSota Yamazaki's character design and animation philosophies bring a sense of maturity and evocativeness to the back half of “CRAZY FOR YOU”, defining the delectably expressive character acting throughout. This approach not only works wonderfully in combination with the striking blue colour usage, but also offers a rather melancholic feeling - one expected from less-than-favourable romance results. Notably, this somber tone is offset by the bright, lemon-yellow accents, a visual nod to Lemon's cheerful personality. The aquatic imagery anchors the narrative in reality, culminating in the bath reveal at the end—an effective symbol of Lemon's innocent romantic hopes and the bittersweet, realistic struggles many of the girls face through their troubled relationships. The character's vocal performance also considerably enhances the ending, contributing a strong draw and a smooth progression that mirrors the evolving visuals, and excellently ties the entire sequence together.",

The ED, “Kamakura STYLE”, takes this element to the extreme through its interesting premise, fun character moments, and a catchy song. \n\n\nThe ED approaches the historical show by anachronistically having characters appear in modern outfits and settings. It uses this premise as a vessel for fun character interactions, such as cavorting in a school bus, dancing at a music festival, and having a picnic together while engaged in comedic action. The soccer ball bookends the start and end of the short, seen early on being dribbled and landing on a character's head at the very end. The expressive animation further highlights the comedic impact of the various sets, such as the squash and stretch used on the bus, and the many expressions of the characters seen as the camera rotates around the picnic goers.\n\n\nThe playfulness of the ED is also conveyed through the song, with the layering of the vocals and the instruments keeping the vibe bright and catchy. Although the rap section can feel a bit out of place for some, the incorporation of audio synched to the visuals helps alleviate the concern. The snappy transitions and dancing villains during the sequence particularly stood out as highlights.\n\n\nAlthough the humor, anachronism, and attempts at quirkiness can fall flat for some, the ED's varied environments, fun character moments, and catchy song make it deserving of praise and a respectable nomination for ED of the year.",

While at times it doesn't sync perfectly with the on-screen visuals, the song leaves a lasting impression on its own.\n\n\n“TAIDADA” reflects *Dandadan*'s more lighthearted side, consisting of smaller gags. While some comedic touches land well, such as the framing of the golden ball reflecting the lucky cat and the quick cuts during the baseball toss near the start of the ED, others miss the mark, resulting in a disjointed tone.\n\n\nVisually, the ED struggles to match the song's energy. While the use of smears at points to convey the running and bobbing motion of the cat are effective, the repeated use of clips, such as the hairdryer segment at the start, quickly lead to the ED feeling repetitive and uninspired. The reliance on still images and looping animations only further emphasizes these shortcomings, resulting in a static and underwhelming visual presentation. The small images in the background during the chorus and when the ball reflects the lucky cat do reinforce the whimsical nature of the ED, though.\n\nDespite its visual flaws, it's easy to see why “TAIDADA” earned a nomination. The upbeat, dynamic song and its playful spirit bring enough charm to stand out, offering a fun, albeit imperfect, ending sequence.",

The heavy instrumentation mirrors the theme's darker undertones, while the clean yet emotionally charged vocals perfectly capture Ruby's inner turmoil. As the song progresses, the build-up feels natural, steadily rising into a gripping chorus.\n\n\nVisually, the ending carries symbolic weight. Ruby's entrapment within a terrarium—then shattered in sync with the chorus drop—is a poignant metaphor for her breaking free and moving forward. Her white dress, symbolizing innocence, gradually darkens until it ends in black, embodying her grief.   \n\n\nUnfortunately, the ending falters with its visual effects and pacing. The recurring color splotches obscure key moments—such as Ruby dancing in various dresses to reflect her shifting emotions—and blend awkwardly with the line art, creating a hazy, cluttered look. The drawn-out pacing aims for emotional weight but unintentionally emphasizes the weaker visual choices, leaving certain scenes feeling more empty than impactful.\n\n\nDespite these missteps, “Burning” remains a bold portrayal of Ruby's grief and growth, anchored by strong music and thoughtful symbolism. The emotional depth of the ending covers for its visual flaws, earning its spot amongst the top endings of the year. ",

          "writeup": "A standout show with a standout ending, “Anytime, Anywhere” from *Sousou no Frieren* is a poignant and emotionally resonant piece that perfectly encapsulates the themes of nostalgia, loss, and quiet perseverance present throughout the series. Despite “Anytime, Anywhere” sharing the same song as *Frieren*'s first ED, it shifts to a different verse and incorporates softer visuals. This more introspective and somber atmosphere sufficiently differentiates it, and allows viewers to better soak in the events of each episode during the latter half of the show.\n\n\nFrom the ED's start, the stop-motion animation sequence is simple, yet deeply effective. It features a slow moving Freiren over a somewhat barren yet intricately detailed landscape with dark linework. The visual storytelling reflects her journey, which was often lonely up until recently, as she processes the passage of time until reaching friendship at the end of the ED. With soft lighting and a warm color palette, it adds a sense of bittersweet comfort, reinforcing the melancholic yet hopeful tone of the series. The music is gentle and soothing with heart-wrenching and tender vocal lines and an acoustic-driven melody that further helps to evoke feelings of longing and friendship.\n\n\nDespite the great visuals and music, the stop-motion animation occasionally feels stilted, and the more monotone backgrounds can clash with the fluidity of the song. That being said, “Anytime, Anywhere” is still one of the best endings of the year and has emotional depth that leaves the viewer reflecting after each episode while fostering an appreciation of the beauty of time, memory, and friendship.",

        "blurb": "If there’s anything that characterizes this year’s AOTY nominees it’s the wide variety in perspectives and opinions that each nominee evoked. Unlike last year, where the front runners were evident early, there was no real consensus about how to rank the top spots. The common element across all nominees was their strong aspects of production, each of them excelling in one or more aspects, showcased by most of the top placements also placing highly in specific production categories.   One relatively agreeable factor that led discussion more so than other years was the impact a strong or weak ending can have on a show. *Yatagaratsu* fell short of a nomination due to a weak second half, and both *Dead Dead Demon’s Dededededestruction* and *Dandadan* were heavily criticised for their poor endings. Even *Monogatari: Off & Monster Season*, which was lauded for the spectacular Nadeko Draw arc, was held back from a top placement due to its relatively weak final arc.   Far more contentious this year were perspectives about narrative and character dynamics, which determined the race between our top two, *Dungeon Meshi* and *Hibike Euphonium*. Those who placed *Hibike* at the top felt that Season 3 did an excellent job concluding Kumiko’s story, whereas a lot of the criticism of the show was focused on the repetitive nature of the drama. Ultimately though, *Dungeon Meshi*’s mix of strong core character dynamics, Marcille’s character, and worldbuilding landed it at the jury’s top spot for Anime of the Year. ",

Precure* provides its own unique spin on the titanic *Precure* franchise by focusing on what it means to be a hero and help those in need, whilst also placing a strong emphasis on gripping high-octane action sequences.\n\n\nThe main cast of Precure drives the thematics of the show through their character arcs and bubbly personalities. Sora is fueled and motivated by a strong desire to help others. Her ideals are constantly challenged and it's through her unwavering determination that she is able to overcome these forces. Mashiro's uncertainty of the future and lack of clear interests worked as she grew to find her place throughout the series. Her relationship with one of the antagonists and how it connected their insecurities resulted in some standout moments.\n\n\nUnfortunately, the arcs of the rest of the cast aren't as strong as the main duo's. Ageha remains as a largely static character who never really faces obstacles that force her to grow and she enters the show as an already largely finished character. Tsubasa similarly felt like a missed opportunity after a strong and promising introduction, and feels largely underutilised for the remainder of the series. \n\n\nWhilst the series is its own different iteration of the franchise it falls to some of the same episodic pitfalls and dips in animation quality as a result of the long runtime. In spite of its flaws the show's strong character dynamics and theming help it stand out and make it one of the most impressive shows of the year. ",

People still need to go to work, go to school, and keep on living their lives beneath the shadow of the alien mothership. And the introduction of alien life hasn't changed the darker side of how society looks at outsiders. \n\n\n*Dededede* gives a variety of perspectives from people directly confronting the new status quo, including voices from the media, the military, and even the prime minister. But the real core of the story comes from Kadode and Ontan, two teens just trying to live their life as the world spirals out of control around them. The balancing act between living your life and dealing with the existential problems of the world serve as a strong contrast for the latter half of the show.\n\n\nAlthough *Dededede* has a great journey, its structure and destination have room to improve. Episode 0 is a confusing decision that leaves newcomers with misleading expectations. Similarly, the finale doesn't seem to line up with much of the story that came before it and muddies the messages of the show. \n\n\nEven though the show is bookended by questionable episodes, the core of *Dededede* is still able to present a flawed but fleshed out world filled with memorable and distinctly designed characters. *Dededede* set out to tell an ambitious story and it doesn't DeDeDeDisappoint.",

          "writeup": "*Monogatari Series: Off and Monster Season*'s first Arc, Nadeko Draw is one of if not the single best arcs of the year. A celebration of the titular character's trials to date and her growth to overcome them, the arc creatively tackles “facing your past” with the series's classic supernatural flair, resulting in a close study of Nadeko's character that offers closure in a tender and impactful finale.  \n\nUnfortunately the latter two arcs, while still solid and enjoyable, are a step down. The character work is messier; while it recontextualizes aspects of Shinobu's character in interesting ways there are also some awkward character introductions that fail to flesh out motivations. The mystery at the center of the arcs also fails to cut the mustard. \n\nLess uneven was the production. A storied series like *Monogatari* has much to live up to, and thankfully this season delivered. *Off Season* pairs arguably the best soundtrack of the year—delivering creatively on motifs from past character themes and crafting new atmospheric tracks—with well-executed visual production and standout performances expected with voice actors of such pedigree. The dialogue remains sharp as ever, and the wide visual language keeps shots visually interesting even in prolonged conversations. Through this the series manages to craft three distinct visual identities for its arcs.\n\nAs the series moves away from Araragi with his arc wrapped up, the cast evolves into new and interesting roles. Nadeko and Yotsugi step seamlessly into the leading role during the first half, offering refreshing chemistry and evolution of their character arcs.",

Exploring the mindsets of a trio of losing girls is the name of the game here, alongside a healthy dose of charming comedy.\n\n\nThe beating heart of this work is its endearing main cast, which covers a wide range of fascinating personalities. Anna stands out through her smug, sharp-tongued attitude when bantering with friends. Contrasting with this, she takes a passive role in love, which causes her to bottle up emotions. Her presence is further elevated by Hikaru Tono's vocal performance that conveys each facet of her excellently. Lemon's socially oblivious romantic longing and Komari's struggle with overwhelming anxiety  allowed each character to gradually develop over the course of the show. For each of them, expressive character animation enhances their eccentricities. Unfortunately the protagonist Nukumizu sticks out due to lacking substance. He's an unremarkable perspective character who occasionally gets into contrived fanservice scenarios, reminiscent of too many other male-oriented romcoms.\n\n\nNonetheless, the show shines through its empathy for lingering feelings after rejections or missed chances. The care on display in its presentation, beyond the aforementioned character animation, also can't be understated. Thoughtful staging, blocking, and lighting enhance dramatic scenes while well-timed editing helps the buildup to comedic moments. Through a refreshing concept for a romance story with excellent execution backing it up, *Makeine* managed to rise to the top as one of 2024's best.",

          "writeup": "As a conclusive crescendo for the franchise, *Hibike! Euphonium 3* delivers on bookending to Kumiko's journey through high school by giving her a spotlight this season. While other seasons primarily feature Kumiko navigating other people's problems, this season focuses on the struggles Kumiko faces herself. Now a senior and club president, the season explores her personal growth as a character over the course of the series. While some characters do see less development as a result of an increased focus on Kumiko, the trade-off is well worth the sacrifice to provide a capstone to what the series has built thus far, both in terms of Kumiko's character and the overall messaging. The penultimate episode in particular stands out as one of the best episodes of the year for how it ties off many of the series' plot threads and the thematic arc of the franchise.\n\n\nThis third season features many of the visual production strengths *Hibike! Euphonium* is known for, taking advantage of fantastic storyboarding and character animation to convey meaning in every scene. Dramatic scenes are elevated through lighting and color design, such as the use of dark purples and oranges in scenes featuring Kumiko and Reina. While many of the anticipated performance scenes were cut from this season, the soundtrack still delivers for emotionally gripping drama and heartwarming slice of life.\n\n\nThis harmonization of these elements all come together to reflect the beauty of *Hibike! Euphonium* and further make the series' third season worthy of celebration as one of the best anime of the year.",

Its performances match the punk nature of the show and have a more genuine rock aesthetic compared to similar series, and Nina's voice actor in particular lends a raw energy to each song.\n\n\n\nThe CGI animation is a standout element; character faces are expressive, in part due to the more advanced facial rigs, and during performances the abundance of dynamic camera shots feeds into the energetic songs. Models are squashed and stretched akin to 2D anime, accentuating the emotions in each action, although being animated almost entirely on 1s does cause it to sometimes lose a sense of weight and momentum.\n\n\nThe cast is one of the more polarizing parts of the show. Nina's headstrong personality is entertaining, but she faces too little pushback from the people around her, which feels too lenient for how confrontational she acts. The dynamics within the rest of the cast are incredibly fun, though for many of them their own plotlines could have been followed up on more, in particular with Subaru and Rupa, both feeling unconcluded. The ending arc is another area where the show stumbles. Nina's resolution with Hina feels contrived due to Hina's behaviour up to it, and happens too late for it to truly hit.\n\n\nNevertheless, *Girls Band Cry* follows up wonderfully on its rebellious outlook with its rock music, expressive animation and strong character dynamics.",

          "writeup": "*Kusuriya no Hitorigoto* blends the genres of mystery and court intrigue through the perspective of the seemingly mundane servant Maomao, an incredibly skilled apothecary, who is the heart of the series. Her sharp wit, dry humor, infectious passion for drugs, and expressive personality make her a delight to follow, carrying the show even when other elements falter. Her interactions—especially with Jinshi—provide much of the show's charm, creating an entertaining back-and-forth dynamic that makes for the funniest bits of the show. \n\nThe mystery aspect is well-crafted, with many smaller episodic cases tying into larger overarching narratives that culminate in satisfying payoffs. Despite the show's second half losing some of the character dynamics and lively atmosphere that made it so engaging, the more cohesive plotline introduced allowed for an inwards look into Maomao's origin, making for a more personal and intriguing mystery.\n\nAdditionally, the show displays vibrant visuals and memorable character designs that are all distinctive with their characteristic colors that make them easier to identify in such a wide cast, while still serving well at conveying emotion and shift of moods. The incorporation of traditional instruments to immerse viewers in the Chinese-inspired court setting.\n\nOverall, *Kusuriya no Hitorigoto* is a well-executed mystery drama, and all of it works thanks to one of the best protagonists that this year of anime has to offer.

Director and *Dunmeshi* super-fan, Yoshihiro Miyajima, alongside many veterans and young talents alike, leads Trigger's adaptive charge into the heart of the dungeon. Their team breathes life into Ryouko Kui's original work, culminating in an audiovisual feast full of creative dishes, intricate worldbuilding, and loveable characters.\n\n\nFrom its first episode, the show hooks the viewer with a simple monster (and meal) of the week formula. Varied monsters and their incorporation into bizarre dishes serve to slowly feed the viewer information about the Dungeon's unique ecology. This consistency provides a backbone for *Dunmeshi* as the plot expands in scope, more parties get introduced, and the societies that have built themselves around the dungeon are fleshed out. What begins as a formulaic necessity becomes a welcome respite that allows our heroes and those around them to heal, converse, and grow.\n\n\n*Dunmeshi*'s expressive and multi-faceted characters, backed by keenly detailed animation, are easy to love and empathize with. The varied soundtrack and the colourful backgrounds immerse you in the beautiful and dangerous world of the dungeon as Laios and gang descend into its depths.

The show nails the otherworldly feeling through the powers of our main characters and the intrigue of the apparitions, prominently visible in Okarun's dynamic running animation and the signature color palette swaps during apparition appearances. \n\n\nThe characters, while entertaining to watch, are a mixed bag overall. Interactions between Momo and Okarun in the earlier episodes are fun and wholesome, but become more predictable and cliched as romantic feelings become more involved. The introduction of Aira and Jiji added some needed intrigue and depth to the cast, but their inclusion made many scenes overly chaotic and created misunderstandings between Momo and Okarun that felt a bit contrived.\n\n\nAlthough the series does occasionally delve into more serious and engaging topics, it frequently uses crass humor as a plot device to throw the main characters in rather perverse situations. This leads to tonal clashes and scenes that are often uncomfortable to watch. \n\n\nNonetheless, *Dandadan* still brings a wide variety of entertaining action sequences and endearing character moments that make it a solid nominee for Anime of the Year.",

Harboring regret for her passive relationships with her friends, Frieren embarks on another journey with Fern and Stark, offering a subtle and nuanced exploration of her experience with time and the lessons she learns about building relationships.\n\n\nThe animation reflects this depth, capturing emotion in even the smallest gestures, be it the tossing of a cloak or Fern's exasperated pout. The action is equally well-crafted, with Stark's dragon battle fluidly adapting a single page of the manga into a tense minutes-long struggle that highlights his strength.\n\n\nThe demons were perhaps the show's biggest letdown. Their depiction as pure evil didn't lead to the intricate principled lessons that *Frieren* is otherwise great at. Still, the show did a reasonable job using the demons to showcase the varied strengths and weaknesses of the cast.\n\n\n*Frieren* is a celebration of fantasy anime, and in a year with many strong shows, there is something for everyone. The highs of *Frieren* are some of the highest of the year, from its stunning animation and thrilling action, to the quiet moments in between.

We did an exercise directly comparing the two, and while there were many valid points raised on both sides, it was the thematic richness of *Mononoke*'s symbolism and the more interesting antagonistic force of the Ooku as a system that narrowly edged out *Look Back*'s tender narrative.",

The lovable, eccentric Totto is the heart and soul of this biographical memoir.\n\n\nOne of the movie's highlights is the mutual respect between adults and children. Principal Kobayashi drives this home with his philosophies on nurturing the children at his school. An endearing friendship forms between Totto and a child with polio in her class named Yasuaki as she showcases heartwarming moments of maturity. Totto reinforces the sense of community the school brings by making Yasuaki feel more included with the rest of the kids. The academy's ideologies provide a great juxtaposition to the conformity that was mandated during wartime. The film does not make the most pointed criticisms of the war as her family is relatively wealthy, but Totto's approach to the hardships with an almost overwhelming amount of positivity helps lift the spirits of those around her as the jingoism looms over everyone's heads.\n\n\nVisually, the film utilizes stunning imaginative sequences and warm backgrounds to represent Totto bringing color to a world turning bleak. The consistently strong character animation keeps up with Totto's energy, but the makeup on the characters alongside the wide smiles creates an uncanny feeling. \n\n\n*Madogiwa no Totto-chan* is among the myriad of Japanese war movies through the perspective of a citizen, yet it still serves as an engaging commentary on the education system (of then and now).\n\n",

          "writeup": "*Precure All Stars F* is Yuta Tanaka's final celebratory act in a franchise he indelibly shaped between *Go! Princess Precure* and his previous films. It carries the torch of previous crossover movies, showcasing breathtaking hand-to-hand combat in the first half and featuring Tanaka's trademark kinetic camerawork during the climactic fight. Furthermore, the film's structure allows for a novel collection of Cures from different iterations of the series to interact. All these interactions are a blast, delivered with spot-on comedic timing and lively character animation.\n\nHowever, *All Stars F* is more than just a collection of incredibly choreographed fights and fun comedic skits; it's Tanaka's thesis statement on a franchise he's loved and worked on for decades, exploring how might does not make right, how our bonds make us stronger than we can ever be individually, and how loving and nurturing something is as much a strength as physical dominance. The only real complaint that can be lodged against this movie is that it's too short to fully flesh out everything it's trying to tackle. Even so, what it delivers is good enough to be a stirring love letter to the franchise and a constant reminder of why everyone should watch *Precure*, regardless of age or gender.\n",

          "writeup": "*Mononoke: Karakasa* is a dense, thrilling audiovisual spectacle from the mind of Kenji Nakamura that marks a triumphant return to the franchise after a 17-year hiatus. Carrying over the traditional Japanese paper-like aesthetic from its predecessor and mixing it with a vibrant color palette, the film creates a psychedelic and otherworldly atmosphere that is both striking and unique. The visuals are coupled with unnerving sound design and fast pacing that work in harmony to build tension throughout the film. The use of match cuts and symbolic imagery, such as the spiraling faces and routine drinking of poisoned water, also underscore the dehumanizing effects of the Ooku system.\n\nAt its core, the film explores themes of individualism, corruption, and the loss of identity through the parallel journeys of Asa and Kame. Asa's quick rise through the ranks is contrasted with Kame's struggle to fit in and maintain her sense of self as both become entrenched in the processes of the Ooku. Aoi Yuuki's harrowing screams as Kame and Tomoyo Kurosawa's resilient portrayal of Asa further adds to the emotional depth of the characters and makes them engaging to follow. The film's story and themes are all tied together through the umbrella motif, which not only represents protection and vulnerability, but also alludes to the true nature of the titular Karakasa.\n\n\nAll in all, *Mononoke: Karakasa* is a thought-provoking and visually stunning film that weaves spectacle with substance. Its cohesive, distinct direction and intricate symbolism make it stand above the crowd, earning its place as one of the best films of the year.\n",

Alongside covering the Shohoku team's last important match, it sets up a captivating dramatic hook by centering Ryouta Miyagi's familial hardships. Weaving Ryouta's backstory sequences into the game's progression where they parallel each other's trajectory lets both narratives coexist with little friction and allows for well-timed switches between them.\n\n\nThe care put into crafting a grounded basketball experience is palpable. 3D-animated characters with distinctive outlining allow for well-choreographed, easy to follow teamplay on the court while additions of 2D speed lines and smears are used to accentuate important motions to great effect. Although outside the sport, the character acting leaves something to be desired as it often comes off as stiff.\n\n\nRyouta's processing of survivor's guilt after losses of family members and insecurities from feeling trapped in his brother's shadow create emotionally resonant pillars to his character arc. While it's unevenly interspersed into the basketball game with the middle section being particularly dense on flashbacks, Ryouta's growth offers a captivating throughline that builds emotional investment for both him and the game he's a part of.\n\n\n*THE FIRST SLAM DUNK* may have slight flaws in its execution, yet the riveting core drama and evident love for its sport let it stand tall among 2024's best anime films.\n",

Featuring some of the most kinetic movement and deranged facial animation of the year, *Uma Musume* is a visual and auditory delight that somehow manages to fuse high octane horse racing with eccentric and entertaining characters to boot. Agnes Tachyon is a hoot to experience as the movie's resident mad scientist, and her dramatic subplot was appropriately handled. \n\n\nThere are of course some flaws; there was not any particularly deep analysis on the nature of horse racing and there is perhaps a bit more style rather than substance present in the overall package. Also, real life horse racing history does indeed railroad some aspects of the film's plot and story. Finally, while nice to see so many characters, given this is a movie some of the side cast felt more like cameos rather than fleshed out individuals. All that aside, *Uma Musume: Pretty Derby - Shin Jidai no Tobira* is an entertaining blockbuster of a film that more than earns its ranking in the category as one of the most interesting and unique watches of the year.\n",

The resulting experience is not one to be scoffed at, delivering on numerous fronts, and acting as an amalgamation of all the best aspects of the show's production up to this point. The majority of rallies are witnessed in their entirety, enabling what is typically reserved for the final rally of each match as a constant experience this time around—Director Susumu Mitsunaka's approach really brings the “movie” feeling of the production to the foreground. Additionally, the character animation and directing feels well-realized, delivering on the expected weighty and defined spikes, sets, and movements viewers have come to adore the show for, while also offering some creative and loose animation to match the more intense rallies.\n\n\nThe well-acquainted comedic moments still hold strong for the movie, as well as the flashback usage across the runtime—aspects that are moderately contentious to some, but feel better tuned and utilized throughout this particular venture. The larger focus on Kenma's character specifically benefits these elements in some ways, offering a more specific character-focused narrative. Both teams have a solid presence and utilization of their team members, either through comedic ways, or directly during the rallies, but the hyper-focusing on individual teammates is certainly notable. Despite this, *Haikyuu!!: Gomi Suteba no Kessen* is exhilarating, well-paced, and feels like a refreshing entry for the series as whole, sure to leave you craving for more to come.",

This time, the focus is squarely on Sakuta as he confronts his past and strained relationship with his mother, laying bare the emotional scars from his forced maturity—having become the primary caregiver for his sister at a young age. Impressively, Sakuta approaches his mother's mental health struggles with an empathetic lens, which strengthens the poignancy of their climactic reconciliation.\n\n\nA key strength of the series is Sakuta and Mai's dynamic, which remains a highlight here as well. The film inverts their roles from the first arc by placing Sakuta in the position of being invisible to the outside world, while Mai becomes his emotional anchor, helping him navigate the trials of Puberty Syndrome. \n\n\nUnfortunately, the film retains the muted aesthetic of its predecessors, which feels too drab on a cinematic scale. The animation is barebones, failing to give key dramatic moments the impact they deserve. The soundtrack is similarly uninspired, relying heavily on melancholic piano pieces with little variation. The film's uninventive cinematic approach is particularly glaring in its depiction of Sakuta's invisibility, which is presented with the same lack of affect as the rest of the movie. \n\n\nUltimately, *Randoseru Girl* lacks the cinematic weight of its competition, feeling more like an extended TV episode than a standalone film. However, it remains a worthy addition to the franchise, and longtime fans will appreciate the film's mature exploration of Sakuta's story.\n",

          "writeup": "Miyazaki's latest swansong weaves a fantasy adventure with an introspective meditation on grief and legacy. *Kimitachi wa Dou Ikiru ka* is his most abstract and thus polarizing film, densely layered with symbolism from both his own filmography and [his overt influences](https://ehoba.hatenablog.com/entry/2023/09/16/141348), and eschewing a straightforward narrative in favor of a dreamlike progression. It also features some of the most striking animation ideas in his career, from Shinya Ohira's visceral depiction of the titular Boy's desperate run toward the hospital fire, to the unsettling transformation of the titular Heron into an absurd caricature.\n\n\nMahito's journey through the Tower is a symbolic exploration of how one grapples with loss and change. Nowhere is this more powerfully realized than in the stunning delivery room scene, which strips both characters of their façades: Mahito, who has denied Natsuko as his mother, calls out to her as one; Natsuko, who has tried to accept her role, finally voices her pain. Their emotional vulnerabilities laid bare, they take the first step toward reconciliation.\n\n\nThe film's climactic conversation sees Mahito's great-uncle urging him to take his place as the next architect of the world, but Mahito rejects this, choosing instead to return to the life he once tried to escape and face its imperfections. It is the film's coda on legacy—not as preservation, but as transformation. Miyazaki, after a lifetime of creation, presents a work that asks not for admiration but for reflection—a film that does not offer answers, only the plea to find our own.\n",

This is further enhanced by well-framed compositions that showcase a keen sense of camera awareness. Furthermore, Yor's paranoia—and subsequent bout of drinking—over Loid's \"infidelity\" leads to some of the film's funniest moments, while Anya's curiosity and mischief keep things lively; whether by eating a critical microfilm embedded in chocolate, or scheming to trap Loid and Yor on a Ferris wheel so they can resolve their misunderstandings.\n\n\nHowever, the second half loses steam during the action-heavy blimp sequence. Loid's fight against the General is a bright spot, using dynamic color shifts and tying back to the General's heightened sense of smell from their taste-testing showdown earlier in the film. In contrast, Yor's big battle, while flashily animated, feels inconsequential, as she's sidelined into fighting a random Terminator expy. The biggest drag, though, is the poop gag, which, despite its visually creative punchline, severely overstays its welcome.\n\n\nThough constrained by the franchise's unshakable status quo, *CODE: White* excels in showcasing the warmth and quirks of the Forger family, delivering an entertaining holiday romp with plenty of laughs and heartwarming moments for fans to enjoy.\n",

Director Kiyotaka Oshiyama infuses his adaptation with as much of his creative spirit as Tatsuki Fujimoto put into his original work. The animated 4-koma pieces, strong energetic and constantly evolving linework, and strong vocal performances from the novice voice actors all add another layer of characterization to the duo of Fujino and Kyomoto. With a team of only eight key animators, the strength of each creator is on full display in many of its cuts, especially with Toshiyuki Inoue drawing many of the major scenes.\n\n\nThe film is able to touch on a core of creation that is oft neglected in favour of celebrating an auteur or propping up the value of hard work: the life experiences that shape them. *Look Back* acknowledges the simultaneous feelings of envy, pride, and sympathetic joy that artists experience when another artist's work is recognized. It captures the ephemeral feeling of creating for the sake of creating as it transitions into creating for others and to be understood by others. The film's most powerful emotional beats are not from the success of creation, but rather from two creators understanding each other: from Fujino's amazing running fistpump to her eventual separation from Kyomoto, culminating in the final snap back to reality as Fujino reads Kyomoto's final 4-koma. *Look Back* is a beautiful film that truly embodies a passion for artistry, through both its deeply personal narrative and exceptional production process alike.\n",

The short focuses on a fox god who builds a living metropolis in miniature, then torments his combative inventions by destroying them and using them to repair his creation.\n\n\nThe black-and-white beginning might mislead someone into believing the entire short is monochrome, but as the fox god brings his newest creation to life, the world floods with color. The most striking visual aspect of the style is its use of a single line width. It would be easy for details to get lost in busy shots, but the short pulls this look off excellently.\n\n\nThe short doubles down on its absurdity when the fox god's creations begin to rebel against him. He then begins smashing them to repair his city and drink their blood. The title *Kamigoroshi* (God Slayer) hints that this will be important to the full piece.\n\n\nThe music's industrial feel and the meandering melodies are reminiscent of a twisted game of *Cities: Skylines*.  As the fox's miniature world is itself a crowded metropolis, pulling off such a narrow niche in musical style is no small feat.\n\n\nThough the short's loose threads leave viewers wanting, there are enough hooks to keep people coming back, particularly with the prospect of a full movie on the horizon.

          "writeup": "Learning to accept yourself is one of life's hardest tasks. In a beautiful mix of animation and music, *Easier To Love You* encapsulates this brilliantly. The song speaks of seeing yourself with the innocent love of the person you were while grasping with the inability to live up to that love—of promises made and broken, and a loneliness that can be mended only by yourself.\n\n\nThe visuals accentuate this loneliness. A foggy blur creates a bleak and gloomy atmosphere, showing the life of a girl employing a fake persona, futilely trying to ignore the past for an unreachable present. The events depicted can be interpreted at increasing levels of abstraction—sometimes hindering overall understanding. Any one interpretation will leave questions unanswered,with unincorporated visual cues and metaphors. This lack of clarity is valid criticism, but it also allows each viewer a different yet intimate relationship with the short.\n\n\nOne interpretation sees the balloon kingdom as an idealized past, the girl's online persona highlighting social media's nostalgia obsession, and the dog as her past self filled with unconditional and innocent love for who she is now. At the climax of the short, she attempts to escape back to her childhood. As the music swells to its zenith, her dog calls her back to the present to reject the hot air and accept—though not necessarily love—herself. The short ends with an attempted suicide only stopped by the transformation of the words “I Am Alive” to “We Are Alive,” referring to her and her dog, the past and the present.",

          "writeup": "Justice's *Neverender* is a hypnotic audiovisual odyssey that blurs the line between music video and immersive experience. Reminiscent of 80's and 90's sci-fi OVAs, the short embraces a retro-futuristic aesthetic, complete with a VHS-like filter that adds a sense of nostalgia and worn-in authenticity. The film's color palette is striking, leaning into bold blues, reds, and yellows while deliberately avoiding green-adjacent hues, giving it a distinctive identity. Its animation is buttery smooth, favoring fluid morphing transitions over hard cuts. These transitions, alongside the pulsating visuals, create a sense of perpetual motion, mirroring the rhythmic energy of the song itself.\n\n\nBut above all else sits the music. Musically, the track is quintessential Justice—layered, electronic, and pulsating with a steady, immersive rhythm. The synth-heavy beats subtly overpower the more traditional instrumental elements which, in tandem with the warm retro-futuristic visuals, give the short an immaculate trance-like vibe. Though the repetitive vocal lines may not carry the same weight as some of the genre's most iconic refrains, the synergy between sound and image is palpable. \n\n\t\nUnlike the strong thematic and emotional cohesion in many of the other shorts in this category, *Neverender* is only pure vibes. Additionally, the gate/stuttering effect around 02:12-02:30 would likely play better at a live event, but it is worse served by digital audio. Even so, these issues hardly detract from the sheer audiovisual brilliance on display.",

It deftly weaves together themes of mystical folklore, artistic inspiration, environmentalism, growth and loss of friendship, and adolescent depression into a tight-knit narrative which reminds us of the importance of human connections, and that no matter how far we are pulled apart our hearts are always still shining together like stars in the sky.\n\nThese themes are elevated by excellent animation and a catchy, emotional song. However, the song's auto-tuned vocals feel out of place and mess with the otherwise fantastic tone.\n\n*Utakata*'s cinematography and art design are its greatest highlights. Intimate character shots, broad scenery, and vivid colors both imbue its uplifting moments with a grand sense of wonder and beauty and make the depressive middle of the story viscerally upsetting. Furthermore, there is a wonderful crafting for its small details, such as the audio-video matching of the recorder, the reflections in the street puddles, and even seeing the novel be typed in real-time instead of just seeing a manuscript.\n\nThis attention to small details comes to its fullest fruition in the finale, where the constellations of the writer and the Van Gogh-inspired art style of the illustrator are combined in a profound climax of both the characters and the short's themes and visual motifs.",

          "writeup": "Lotte commercials have become a staple of the short film category, and this latest effort by Yoh Yoshinari and Studio Trigger does not disappoint. Unlike its predecessors, *Chocolat Cadabra* isn't a simplistic and overly romanticized love story; instead, it's a fantastical reimagining of the mythos of Lotte's chocolates. The commercial features a witch girl clad in black—acting as a stand-in for artisanal chocolatiering—battling a scientist girl clad in white—representing industrial mass production—for the attention of a girl clad in red. The red girl is more difficult to interpret, oscillating between being coveted by the other two girls and experiencing death, a mythical afterlife, and rebirth in the runtime of the film. The marketing copy suggests she represents Lotte's original chocolate bars, while a Marxist lens might paint her as raw chocolate being molded into a useful product by the human practices represented by the other two girls. In either case, the triumvirate of girls comes together in a catchy dance number to create the perfect synthesis: Lotte's newest chocolate bars. \n\n\nAdo's earworm-inducing musical phrasing, combined with Yoshinari's impeccable sense of shape and color design, makes for an attention-grabbing piece of commercial animation, which chiefly can't place higher because it lacks the authenticity and personal credence present in its competition. \n",

          "writeup": "Indie animator OFF SCRIPT ports over the adventures of Aira, the girl with an arrow through her head, and her cat, Smiley, from his charming series of web shorts into the rich world of Eve's music videos. *Lazy Cat* forgoes the complex lore common in many Eve videos, opting instead for a nuanced exploration of pet ownership's positive impact on mood. \n\n\nThe short showcases Aira's initial listlessness, immediately enlivened by meeting Smiley through playful bits of animation. This joy is disrupted by the realization that they are being surveilled, at which point the short plunges into darkness, inverting OFF SCRIPT's signature white-on-black aesthetic to a striking black-on-white one that plays with the idea of illuminated surfaces to perfectly capture Aira's paranoia. This continues until she dozes off, triggering a shift in style to the surreal. Here, the animation shines in particular, with clever visuals like a tennis racket slicing through tennis balls like butter and surfing on snow using an airplane door after being ejected from a plane. The unnerving final stinger reveals they are still under surveillance, even as Aira seemingly sleepwalks to a remote mountain. \n\n\nDespite this ostensibly simple narrative used to connect its collection of loose set pieces, the energy and creativity of OFF SCRIPT's animation propels the short to be an exhilarating experience. Overall, *Lazy Cat* stands out as a memorable and striking entry, leaving a lasting impression even beyond its respectable finish.\n",

          "writeup": "*Garden of Remembrance* by director Naoko Yamada is a visually stunning and emotionally heavy short that conveys the monotonous nature of daily life while simultaneously tackling themes of reopening old wounds and healing in a unique fashion.\n\n\nThe first half of the short is centered around a beautiful, extended montage of the protagonist going about her morning routine that uses a rotation motif to highlight the stagnation in her life. Meanwhile, emoji reactions from an external observer add a fun, modern touch and a hint of intrigue that keep this section engaging. Its soft lineart and pastel art style also provides warmth to the short that meshes with the grounded, personal vibe of the first half, and transitions well into the intimate and nostalgic themes of the second half through color variance.\n\n\nWhen the protagonist opens their closet to reveal an explosion of flowers and objects from her lost lover, the previously slow acoustic guitar ramps up to a shoegaze-esque sound that matches her feelings as memories rush back. This climax not only serves to expertly recontextualize her actions in the first half as habits she'd previously formed with her partner, but also reveals that the emojis represented her boyfriend watching over her all along.\n\n\nAlthough the first few minutes can feel a bit repetitive and the black haired girl feels underutilized in relation to the central narrative, *Garden of Remembrance* excels for how well it manages to build into its crescendo and convey its themes of loss in an experimental and intimate way.",

Key scenes, such as the alien assault on Momo and Okarun's dramatic intervention in the premiere, are reimagined with Zutomayo and Unigiri, her mascot. This gives the impression that they are cosplayers reenacting their favorite scenes from the series. \n\n\nWhile the original ending's thematic core—Turbo Granny's playful escapades in the absence of Momo and her grandmother—is diluted by the insertion of Zutomayo and Unigiri (either superimposed over Turbo Granny's base animation or appearing alongside her), the music video adeptly carries forward the aesthetic language established in the ending. This includes its characteristic color inversion and the tessellated use of repetitive imagery, achieved through techniques like tiling of previous shots and the application of After Effects' repeater and wobble effects on art assets. \n\n\nDespite the limited animation of the core assets—with any movement being derived from the genga from the series and the original ending sequence—the aforementioned aesthetic effects, combined with the incorporation of memetic imagery like Nyan Cat, generate a compelling sense of dynamism and visual interest. This makes the music video a thoroughly engaging experience and a worthy nomination.",

Complementing its poppy disco sound, experimental art duo MimicryMeta crafts a unique behind-the-scenes music video, blending live-action and animation to create an absolute gem of a short.\n\n\n*Bibbidiba* shines when both of its multimedia elements interact with each other. Some scenes, such as when we watch artists draw in the background and the prince's costume, or when Suisei squares up to the director, create a visually immersive experience, as if the virtual and real were all occupying the same space. However, this integration isn't always seamless. Its compositing falters at multiple points, leading to flat-looking characters and distractingly obvious green screens. Additionally, during the final dance, the animated face and hands don't quite follow the movements of the dancer, creating jarring and uncanny visuals that don't match the rest of the music video. \n\n\nThe lyrics and concept of *Bibbidiba* build upon the theme of not wanting to be Cinderella introduced in Suisei's prior hit, *Stellar Stellar*. While the final scenes where she throws away her costume and dances align with this theme, the plotline where she fights with her prickly director feels out of place. But despite these flaws, *Bibbidiba* deserves its current popularity; its fusion of animated and real-life elements alongside a catchy song and viral dance create an enchanting experience.",

          "writeup": "*ONE PIECE FAN LETTER* effuses passion for the parent series, lovingly crafting something that is both a love letter and a fantastic story in and of itself, complete with clever metacommentary on the larger *One Piece* series. *FAN LETTER*, true to its name, celebrates the many ways fans enjoy the series. From ridiculous power-scaling arguments, to conspiratorial sleuthing, to pure passion for the characters and what they stand for, it leaves plenty of space for viewers to identify with its characters. This is particularly so when the point-of-view characters are all ordinary folk who live in the shadow of these legendary heroes. This twist creates a fascinating metatext, further compounded by setting the short in a very important and memorable place in the story. The crowd's anticipation as the Straw Hats reform captures the same excitement and intrigue as when it first aired, mirroring the nostalgia that fans harbor. By placing the characters and audience far from the beloved Straw Hat Pirates, it emphasizes how a small, seemingly ordinary person can enact change, which is also embodied by the short's puzzle motif.\n\n\nVisually, the short is stunning. Its backgrounds feel lived in and are full of nods to the series, and Soty's original character designs fit within the existing aesthetic but also feel fresh and inspired, wonderfully supporting the animation with cartoonish design and sensibility. Visionary director Ishitani's storyboarding matches the story beat-for-beat, offering bombastic fight choreography and epic scale when asked but also nailing smaller, more intimate moments while bridging the short seamlessly with clever transitions to tie together all of the wonderful moments and craft the best short of the year.",

They are the ones we gossip about as if they were real, the ones whose laughter and tears are our own, the ones we embody through cosplay and fashion.   Anime, in particular, exemplifies this transcendent craft. The medium’s boundless creativity allows for moments so deeply personal they etch themselves into memory, for battles so electrifying that they become modern legends. At the heart of it all are the characters offering an escape from reality or a mirror of it, reflecting to us that our struggles and journeys are filled with purpose.    As anime increases in popularity these truths only become more evident. Its characters grow larger than their original works or national borders and they appear in murals on city streets, in the language we use, in the tiny charms swinging from our bags. Their presence is inescapable, yet is a welcome reminder, silent but powerful. One of a shared passion, an opportunity to spark conversation, a sense of representation, and of a global community, much like these Awards, which celebrates not just anime but lives made richer by it.   The ten nominations for Character of the Year were recognized by both the public and jury as those that embodied this spirit of anime. They inspired us to chase our passions, to laugh at our mistakes, to cherish those around us.

          "writeup": "*Mayonaka Punch* makes a very bold decision at the start of the series, establishing Masaki as not just abrasive and demanding, but also as someone who is outright violent. Typically the combination of a light-hearted comedy centered around a loathsome lead doesn't work, but it pays off here for a simple reason: Masaki comes across as a realistic depiction of a flawed person.\n\n\nThis depiction is best demonstrated by her relentless pursuit of content creation, and the way  Masaki puts her money where her mouth is. She asks the world of people she works with, but that's only because she demands the world of herself. At the same time, *Mayonaka Punch* shows that Masaki is self-aware of how she comes across. She's able to “turn-off” the part of her brain that just wants to churn out YouTube videos, reflect on her actions, and ultimately make genuine, heartfelt apologies to those she wrongs.\n\n\nWhile it's hard to pin down a particular aspect of Masaki's that is poorly handled, the emotional peaks of her arc don't manage to reach the same heights as other characters on this list. One could almost argue this is fitting, however, as if Masaki is a true YouTuber who understands her appeal and doesn't deviate far from the audience's expectations by inserting melodrama. Throughout the duration of *Mayonaka Punch* Masaki's portrayal never seems “over-the-top”; her demanding nature is instead presented with a subtlety that keeps her character feeling authentic.\n\n\nOverall, Masaki establishes herself as a solid, well-done character, and manages to (over)work her way into the audience's hearts.",

Nadeko Draw not only has her learn to acknowledge the flaws of her past but also accept it as an important part of herself, leading to her both growing as a person and helping her move towards her dream of becoming a mangaka.\n\nThis is done in a delightfully meta way, having Nadeko confront past versions of herself from across the course of this long-running series. Forcing her to take responsibility for her past actions and face her problems head-on, which is a departure from her prior depictions, ending in a cathartic moment that sets the stage for Nadeko's future to be a bright one.\n\n*Off & Monster Season*'s visuals perfectly compliment Nadeko's character arc, playing into her dream by featuring a plethora of manga-related motifs. The visuals also brilliantly put you in Nadeko's mind through imaginative visual depictions of her thoughts. Having five distinct designs signifying different parts of Nadeko's life is another strength of the production, showcasing the change in her character over time. Kana Hanazawa delivers an impressive voice-acting performance wonderfully portraying the shy nature of Nadeko and the confidence she gains throughout her arc.\n\nNadeko Draw is the perfect capstone to Nadeko's journey across the course of the *Monogatari* franchise, a poignant character arc that not only accepts the past but also looks towards the future.",

Scene by scene she takes center stage with unforgettable comedic and dramatic moments, dazzling with excellent character acting and imbuing the role of the straight man with an eccentricity all her own.\n\n\nWhile her relationships with characters outside the main party, including Falin, have room to develop, she demonstrates the strongest capacity and desire for growth within the group, manifesting even in her character design through her constantly changing hairstyles. She is irritable yet compassionate, stubborn yet courageous—so human that her being an elf almost feels ironic. \n\n\nHer grounding presence becomes even more striking when she introduces a supernatural moral complexity, delivering a poignant reminder that *Dungeon Meshi*'s jovial adventure is laced with difficult choices. Yet, this reveal isn't meant to be a cheap shock nor is Marcille reduced to a narrative twist. Instead, having come to see her as complex and deeply human, the moment seamlessly folds into her character, elevating the narrative without jarring tonal shifts.

The unique CG style of *Girls Band Cry*'s character designs lend themselves well to Nina being a very expressive character, and her wide variety of performance outfits adds to her characterization.\n\nWhile Nina's feud with Hina feels rather contrived it allows much-needed room for Nina to grow as a character, realizing that she isn't necessarily always right. That being said, this happens way too late in the show as she isn't always challenged on her beliefs before this. The highlight of Nina's character arc comes when her beliefs are finally challenged, pushing her to confront her family issues head-on rather than running away, as she did before the story began. This moment emphasizes the growth and maturity she gains throughout * Girls Band Cry*, delivering a powerful climax to her arc.\n\nWhile Nina's development throughout the show is a little mixed, she stands out as a character who leaves a big impact with an incredibly strong presence.",

Conceptually, he takes on one of the most unique roles of any character this year. Not just living within Frieren's heart, but in the heart of the people and stories of the world she traverses, having monuments and tales passed down generations, commemorating the journey they once had together.\n\nBeing relegated to a supporting role with only a single episode dedicated to him, Himmel doesn't have the same depth and emotional weight as characters who actively take a part throughout the entire story. However, the blue shimmering meteor shower we're introduced to here, both from Himmel's youth and on his death bed, beautifully parallels Himmel's own existence. In his youth it represented his ambitions, on his death bed it represented the fleeting impermanence of his existence, and as a memory within Frieren it represented what monumental impact small interactions and experiences can have on one's life.\n\nHimmel may not be the most fleshed out character, but he shines brightly as the only supporting nomination from this year. His intriguing conceptual role, leaving a long-lasting legacy for Frieren to follow and lifting her up as a proper protagonist of the series, is what Himmel the Hero would have done in life and does brilliantly so as a supporting character.",

          "writeup": "Anna's character is a pleasure to watch thanks to her quirky and snarky personality, humorous and varied reaction faces, and a knack for delivering jokes that consistently land. Her dialogue feels fresh and naturally casual, setting the groundwork in her relationship with Nukumizu. Hikaru Tono's performance elevates simple scenes such as the repeated stairwell lunches, with a casual yet dynamic energy. Yet, her playfulness doesn't solely define her. Anna repeatedly expresses sincere sadness without the melodramatic breakdowns typical of romance anime, and expresses genuine annoyance with Nukumizu's actions when appropriate.\n\nHowever, Anna does take the backseat to other cast members as the show goes on. While her ability to see through characters' feelings and appeal for action is there, her interactions outside of Nukumizu are quite limited in their appeal. Despite there being some depth to her character, Anna demonstrates very little demonstrable growth in the arcs we see. The running gag about her love for food is somewhat hit-or-miss, growing a bit stale towards the later parts of the show.\n\nOverall, this goblin will still gobble up any viewer's heart, with her snarky gremliny nature. Her chemistry with Nukumizu is a treat, striking a delicate balance between platonic friends and potential romance, which helps keep the viewers engaged. This blue-haired childhood friend won't win here either, but at least she secures a spot among the nominees with her endearing energy.",

          "writeup": "In a show where everything is dialed up to eleven, Momo thrives in both action and comedy, setting *Dandadan*'s frenetic tempo and propelling the bizarre chaos that defines it. Her attitude originates from the gyaru caricature but quickly blends in humor, action, and absurdity, tying together the cast of eccentric personalities. She effortlessly bounces off the show's different environments, whether at school, at home, or in the supernatural, approaching each with modern dialogue that is cohesive, comedic, and memorable. \n\n\nMomo's explosive and expressive personality extends beyond the comedic moments of jealousy towards her frenemy Aira or banter with her grandmother, to permeate throughout the season into the action sequences. These scenes are not just high intensity and absurdist, but also inspiring as Momo takes a courageous and inventive leadership role that emphasizes the unique abilities of the cast. Her paranormal powers continue to sharpen with each battle, but she remains the same charming Momo, integrating them into daily life in a way that is unmistakably her.  \n\n\nHer relationship with Okarun also fuels the show through their comedic and energetic clash of opposites. However, the overwhelming intensity of their dynamic struggles to be tempered by a grounding cast, and a conventional romance reliant on predictable dramatic tension and misunderstandings eclipses their spontaneous and unique chemistry. But even as predictability creeps in, Momo stands out in her ability to match *Dandadan*'s otherwise ceaseless energy, capitalizing on the show's zany characters to deliver a bizarre, funny, and unforgettable experience with supernatural vitality and charm.",

          "writeup": "Eponymous characters often feel like they should do more than their counterparts, and expectations for them are high. Frieren provides a unique twist on common fantasy premises, has a fun mentor/caretaker dynamic with Fern, and utilizes Himmel flashbacks to novelly present past one-sided love and growing love that can only ever be one-sided, exceeding these expectations.\n\nPerhaps the strongest element of Frieren's character is the way she builds on and supports core themes around the concept of time. She is depicted as essentially immune from the ravages of age, yet those around her are not. As Frieren makes the choice to come to understand humans and build relationships with them, she not only opens herself up to the pain, grief, and suffering that comes with the passage of time, but also the feelings of achievement, wonder, and fulfillment. \n\nSince Frieren is ageless, it makes sense for her to be such a powerful mage. It doesn't lend itself well to depicting significant growth or having fights that are fraught with tension, however. Unlike many characters Frieren is somewhat static, and never really feels pressured or pushed to grow by any characters in her present. Even these things can be positive at times though, making her into the “final boss” of her own show. \n\n*Sousou no Frieren* wouldn't be the same without Frieren. Not only does she support core themes, but she is simply fun to watch. Because of that, she's able to find a strong finish hidden inside of a mimic.",

          "writeup": "Maomao is the secret ingredient that makes *Kusuriya no Hitorigoto* work. With an encyclopedic knowledge of herbs and medicine and a genius mind for deduction, she can do it all. This proficiency is why it's so interesting to follow her life as a servant sold by her kidnappers to the inner palace. The juxtaposition of such a promising young woman being treated as the bottom of the totem pole is an intriguing dynamic, made even more compelling by Maomao's insistence on keeping her head down and staying in her place. Although there are a few wise members of the inner palace who see her potential, Maomao has no ambition to be the nail that sticks out and gets hammered back down.\n\n\nBut she does just that, again and again, because only she has the detective mindset to help those around her. These conflicting desires help with shaping her into the inner palace's sarcastic and scheming hero. When she's not busy with saving the day, Maomao is coloured by her unhealthy obsession with poison and her wonderfully expressive faces and chibi forms. She is able to bring a sense of excitement and joy most would struggle to give to such mundane objects as herbs and fungi. \n\n\nMaomao is a true standout, even the cast of her own show struggles to live up to the degree of entertainment she brings to the show. But if anyone can bear the weight of the world on her shoulders, it's the girl at the bottom of the pecking order.",
