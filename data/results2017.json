The judges found that the series had excellent production values, an enchanting world, and a great dynamic between its two leads. The action sequences are generally quite strong, with some inventive weaponry and impressive animation. Dragons in a modern world present some interesting ideas, and the general anti-war sentiment of the movie comes through wonderfully. However, underdeveloped antagonists and an abrupt ending keep the series from really excelling. The jury was somewhat divided on the series, with some praising the originality of the concept, and others finding too many elements of the world being insufficiently detailed. The one complaint that was shared by the entire jury was that the series needed additional time to build up more attachment to the characters. However, all judges believed it deserved a place on the list as one of the most new imaginative series of the year.",

       "writeup": "The consensus choice for the sixth spot, Re:Creators is a series that had some good ideas, and at times some excellent execution. The dynamic between creator and creation is something truly unique, and it leads to some stellar moments. The soundtrack was considered one of the best in this category by the jury, though a couple tracks were noted as being overused. The action sequences are hit and miss, with some real stand-out fights, but several that are quite forgettable. However, it often gets bogged down in exposition, both the protagonist and the antagonist are underwhelming, and the conclusion left a lot to be desired. The jury felt that, on the whole, it was a series that squandered a premise that had a lot of potential. There's plenty of things that the series gets right, but it's weighed down by a number of problems that were too much for the judges to ignore.",

Over the top action and mayhem has rarely been this fun, and Kekkai Sensen knows how to play its audience to perfection. Even in episodes when it would take a more serious look at the characters, it still managed to bridge the gap well enough so as to work within the series. The jury found that while the episodic format did make for an entertaining watch, it did prevent Kekkai Sensen from having the dept of other series, and that the plot at the end was less than stellar and not especially well foreshadowed. As a result, the jury felt that Kekkai Sensen deserved to find itself in a respectable 3rd place on our list.",

While it could have easily been a low effort action show, Youjo Senki instead managed to stay reasonably grounded within its absurd premise. With a solid approach to military tactics and a lead who tries to stay within the confines of the rules, the show is able to bring some fun twists to the isekai genre. While used sparingly, the dynamic between Tanya and Being X was fascinating, and the series makes some interesting comparisons between a soldier and salaryman that, while simple, were definitely quite poignant. There's a gradual buildup in action, and while it feels like the series hasn't yet reached its peak, it left a strong impression on the jurors. It did still have some problems, as the supporting cast isn't sufficiently developed and it has a weaker overall visual presentation when compared to other entries. Otherwise, it's an excellent series that the jury felt was very deserving of the second spot in action.",

For some of the judges, it had them on the edge of their seats. Others found that it had jumped the shark and that the show was really starting to become a mess. At their best, the action sequences are absolutely gorgeous to watch, with some of the most fluid animation in television. The development of the supporting cast was also seen as a large boon to the series. Most judges had the series near the bottom of their list, though it wasn't far removed from the Dragon Dentist, and deciding which series would be fourth, and which fifth, was the lengthiest deliberation in the process for the action jury.",

The continued development of the main cast, both in terms of their skill sets and their characters, was well executed, though some of the supporting cast left a little to be desired. The series takes advantage of the different abilities of its characters to produce action sequences beyond just fights, leading to some of the most diverse action of the year. Stain also presented the compelling antagonist the series needed, elevating the second half with a fascinating look at the implications of heroes within the world of the series. The production values are exceptional, with terrific artwork, animation, and a soundtrack that brings the action to life.

Some believed it to be a charming, if flawed, look at youth subculture and the pitfalls of being creative, while others looked at it and saw a messily scripted, poorly paced show with characterization that fell flat. Most of us praised the show’s explosive pastel artstyle, but we agreed that its animation quality was consistently below par, and the visuals at times became confused in their usage of patterned elements, while nothing else about the show’s production was worth writing home about. Generally the jury felt that, despite failing to deliver on its unique premise, at the very least URAHARA had interesting ideas at its core – and it’s because of this that we have ranked it in fifth place.",

Even ignoring its beloved predecessor, it’s hard to muster up a long list of qualities for this new adaptation. Few aspects of the production were solid, Aoi Yuuki’s performance was solid, the jurors generally agreed that at least one or two of the episodes were solid (specifics per juror vary), but the vast majority of the show was an utter mess. Thematically the show presents itself boring, often over-exaggerating some points whilst bluntly and poorly delivering others through direct statements that lack any sort of nuance, preferring to tell rather than show. Kino 2017 in general fails to capture a strong atmosphere through which the viewer can latch onto its world and sense of style, often leading things disconnected. Characterisation is inconsistent at best, with the titular Kino switching between passive observer and action hero, and the ever-so-present male compadre Shizu, whose inclusion into the narrative is utterly confusing and awfully executed. Ultimately, Kino 2017’s inability to properly execute such a wide variety of ideas has it fall to the bottom of this list, as there are just so few things it manages to do right. All of this capped off with possibly one of the worst finales in the entire year.",

Not many anticipated that the simple yet innocent meeting between our protagonists, Kaban and Serval, would end taking the community by storm. With an unorthodox art direction, novice seiyuus and the consideration of Kemono Friends’ intended audience, questions may be raised with respects to its placing.\n\n\nDespite the obvious differences and flaws that can be pointed out, majority of the jury agreed that the writing form and its overall cohesion serves as the driving force for Kemono Friend’s successes in this category. For most parts, the plot is linear and straightforward but the magic comes in the overall plot development and the accompanying prospect of worldbuilding. Through clever writing filled with detail and the subtle drops of new information, hints are made towards a setting that goes further beyond from what is shown on screen. The undertones of a post-apocalyptic world are implied but there is never enough information that is provided. It leaves a sense of immersion in this beautifully crafted world. The interactions between the ensemble of our lovable ‘Friends’ were also a pleasure to watch. In an age where production serves as an integral part towards success, Kemono Friends has proved that this is not necessarily the case. In the end, the jury agreed this is an entry that is truly one its kind and should be recognised for its achievements.",

       "writeup": "Little Witch Academia takes 4th for the jury, though it was essentially tied with Kemono Friends. Jurors recognised LWA for its great use of music, particularly its orchestral tracks, and reference-packed sound effects. The colors and and designs chosen allow TRIGGER to show off their motion-heavy animation, which looks good even when art is taken off model. They also allow for some expressive character animation, giving some personality to characters who may only see one episode of real screentime over the two cours. Most jurors criticized the show’s pacing and overall storytelling - a strength of Kemono Friends - and the role of Croix as a cartoon villain, though some enjoyed the throwback to Saturday morning cartoons. Jurors were also disappointed in the lack of focus on Sucy and Lotte, who coming from previous installments in the franchise were expected to be main characters alongside Akko. However, while some other episodic inclusions fell flat, the Imaishi-inspired episode for Sucy was a highlight. The themes of belief and hard work were viewed as one of the show’s key strengths, though some argued the show undermined them with its conclusion. Overall, LWA is a fantastic production with some moments of brilliance in a weak overarching tale.",

The show treads a careful line of familiar and alien throughout its run: from the stellar blend of traditional and CG animation, to the slender and doll-like design of its genderless cast, to the mix of Eastern philosophy with the conventional tale of self-discovery in its writing. Each character that our protagonist Phos meets may only be focused on for a couple of episodes, but they all feel incredibly fleshed out; every arc feels impactful, and their influence on Phos reverberates throughout each of the following episodes. While the majority of the story is confined to the titular island of gems, a barren facsimile to our own Earth, its many gorgeous environments more than evoke the same sense of awe and mystique that other anime like Made in Abyss provide. The excessive camerawork and low-framerates can be off-putting at times; however, more often than not, Houseki’s visual storytelling is an absolute wonder to behold, especially the spectacular cuts with Diamond in episodes 3 and 10. Houseki no Kuni is a brilliant show that sets a high bar not only for CG anime, but all anime to come.",

Unfortunately, it does not do much with the premise aside from just introducing it. It instead chooses to focus on the two main characters: Riko, who goes down the abyss in search of her mother, and Reg, a robot with amnesia. The plot itself isn't exactly bad, the two do have several nice moments, but its not that new and considering how amazing the world is, you can't help but sigh at the missed potential.

Some of this could be contributed to production issues, which was disappointing coming from the studio responsible for Honobo Log.

However, the show suffered following the realization that Xin was Fen's online friend the whole time, and the jury was mixed on the introduction of the younger sister character in episode 8.",

While many of us magically viewed the adventure aspect as magical, and were awestruck by the magic of the humor advancing the magical plot, some didn't appreciate the magic, claiming the humor lowered the magical stakes enough where, unfortunately, the magic was lost.  What was the magical mix of humor and adventure magically was different for each juror.  Magically, while some ultimately thought the magic was captured, others wanted more magical adventure, and others more humorous magic.  Ultimately, the main reason it magically didn't win was that the magic was sadly lost on some magical jurors, with complaints of the magically quick pacing and the often magically childish tone.  Despite this, we magically concluded that it had enough magic to be one of the magically successful shows in the (not-so) magical genre this year.",

The main contention of the ranking was the characters, Gabriel and Raphi being generally more liked, where as Satania and Vigne were on the more criticized end. Vigne came across as a one-joke character to most, with her constant sadism getting old fast, especially the running joke of the cat constantly stealing Gab’s drinks. Satania’s constant laziness also got on some juror’s nerves, as her refusal to do anything slowly became more annoying as the show went on, with her job at the convenience store being one of her few highlights. For those that liked the show, Gab and Raphi were really the standout cast members. Vigne is one of the better lovable idiots we’ve had in a while, and when she wasn’t being coerced into doing stupid things by Satania, she was always finding creative ways to make a fool of herself. Meanwhile, Gab played the straight character, mostly using Raphi’s laziness to express her good morals, causing a lot of hilarity between the two. Overall, only half of the main cast being liked, combined with nothing of note going on in any of the other aspects of the show (Setting, plot, side characters), leaves us with a comedy that is fun on its own, but falls short of being a serious comedy of the year candidate.",

The main cast, which seemed to be focused more on Aqua and Kazuma this time around, continues to bounce off each other extremely well, with comedic timing and joke delivery that surpassed anything else put out this year. It managed to avoid getting stale by sending the cast off on a journey outside of the town in the latter half of the season. This allowed for a wealth of new situations for our characters to interact in which, despite knowing all the main cast's quirks, still produced great moment after great moment. This season also came with a host of new side characters, such as Sena, Vanir, and the Axis Cult who never really stuck around for long, but shone as great additions to the cast for the couple episodes that they were in. Overall, Konosuba 2 doesn't revolutionize the comedy genre, it just executes everything it wants to do to near perfection. A great cast of characters that are consistently put into situations to be funny, combined with some great pacing and comedic timing make for a show that is a blast to watch from start to finish, cementing itself as our top comedy of the year.",

The more positive opinions were that the show continued in the same spirit as the first season—be it in terms of art, characters, or plot-lines—putting enough of a new spin on them to satisfy, though the jury was unanimous in preferring the prequel. To some jurors, the large, varied cast and unique magic of the folk-lore based setting were among the show's strengths. Others lamented a lack of quality character writing, unimpressed by the new character conflicts. \n\nOne of the most common negative reactions was to the very loose and unresolved structure of the plot, if Uchouten Kazoku 2's collection of events could reasonably be called a plot. The most linear plot thread, that of the Ebisugawa family's attempts at revenge, was disliked both for its lack of originality, as well as for the bafflingly naivety of the Shimogamo family in regards to it. A lack of satisfying plot progression and pacing is not necessarily a detriment in an anime driven by its characters or atmosphere, but as there were several complaints in those departments as well, reactions varied from juror to juror in regards to the validity of that argument. Additionally, while the issue of loose plot strings could potentially be tied up neatly in the event of a further sequel, several jurors felt that they nevertheless weakened the impact of the second season.\n\nDespite these critiques, the greater issue for most of the drama jury was that Uchouten Kazoku 2 was just not as outstanding as the shows above it, which were far more consistently lauded.",

Unfortunately, however, it does not move far enough forward in the writing to be move beyond the bottom of this list - one that’s stacked with other far more refined dramas. Saekano still suffers from an uninteresting protagonist - Aki Tomoya - who is rather bland even throughout season two; Eriri and Utaha have some chances to shine, being forced to make difficult decisions by the narrative, although they often regress back into their original state soon thereafter. Katou is still the beacon of light in an otherwise drab show, provided a snarkiness that appeals to many, though such humor is often overtaken by the poorly-executed attempts at self-aware jabs to the tropes it presents, which still come off as mildly pretentious due to how little the show actually has to say with regards to this callout. All in all, Saekano’s second season is certainly better than its predecessor, though the show still suffers from a myriad of flaws that drag it below the other entries on this list.",

Sakura Quest is sugarcoating things and makes them more sweet than they are, but that makes the anime easier to consume. Characters are not strikingly good, yet all of them have dedicated arcs, develop in a certain way, find their own goal in life and move on. What really makes Sakura Quest is its ending - it's pretty much perfect and capitalizes on all the slow build-up the series had prior to that moment. The question - who's gonna wait for the ending and not drop series in the middle - stands still, and that's why it's in the lower half of the list.",

The greatest strength of the series has always been in its ability to craft complex characters with deeply personal individual stories, but Monogatari also excels at tying in its supporting cast and telling an intense, high stakes plot that was to culminate in this season. It is in the latter category that Owari 2 sadly came up short. The installment displays an appalling lack of attention or resolution for characters that had been built up as major players for the main story, such as Gaen, Kagenui and even Kiss-Shot, which makes the central mysterious conflict of the story fall flat. But despite these disappointments, Owari 2 still delivers perfectly on the parts that matter most. Araragi's final confrontation with Ougi is a masterpiece of a scene. Both of these characters who are most central to Owarimonogatari received flawless endings to their stories, allowing Owarimonogatari 2 to still live up to Monogatari's reputation as one of the best-written series around.",

       "writeup": "Though only truly terrible in a few aspects, 10cm was agreed to be the most unappealing of the nominees for best romance by a wide margin. For us, 10cm makes this list as a result of being the best of a tier of shows that are all a clear step below our top five. Unsurprisingly, then, it only received two votes placing it higher than 6th.\n\nThe main criticism we had was with the plot progression. Though the first episode or two got off to a strong start, an overly cliché main conflict was introduced, and the characters’ complete refusal to communicate resulted in a frustrating middle section. Though presumably meant to lead into a satisfying conclusion, the jury considered the ending to be ended up painfully idealistic, quickly-wrapped-up, and heavily reliant on a “Red String of Fate.”\n\nTo touch briefly on what we did enjoy from 10cm, it did at least have respectable production value, and was paced reasonably well to make each of its six episodes build upon one another. Its characters, though they ended up being seen as relatively unsavory given the plot’s direction, had a decent base from which to work off of, as well.  While this was enough to earn our consideration, it wasn’t enough to even consider moving up any higher.\n",

       "writeup": "While Just Because! was not nearly as abhorred by most of the jury as 10cm was, it suffered from poorly-implemented relationship development and a disappointing loss of self-direction. Jurors took issue with how the show ends up idealizing an ending that relies heavily on the “Red String of Fate” trope in spite of earlier episodes emphasizing a realistic tone. Although early episodes did manage to sell the show's tone and characters to the jury, later episodes failed to convince us that the “fate” that pushes these characters together is caused by anything more than convenience and juvenile notions of love. Jurors also criticized the show's lack of originality and underdevelopment of romantic pairings, especially in contrast to other nominees. \n\nHowever, jurors praised the show for doing things that no other anime did quite as well this year in its subtle plot progression and development through subtext and character animation, rather than just expositional dialogue. It further took something that is normally a death knell for lesser shows, the molasses-slow pacing, and turned it into an advantage which made every little wince, blink, and glance feel that much more impactful.\n\nThe realistic characters and tone were also appreciated, with each of the characters feeling lived-in despite only seeing a short excerpt of their lives. Unfortunately, Just Because! was a show that fumbled its potential. Although it could have provided a unique perspective on growing up and moving on after high school, the show instead concluded largely in an undeserved fashion.",

One aspect of the show we universally agreed was impressive was its production value, especially in terms of visual storytelling, soundtrack, and sound design. Scum's Wish clearly knocked it out of the park in terms of quality and ambitious themes, its exploration of which is something most romance anime never come close to touching.\n\nHowever, while some of our judges viewed the plot as a pensive dive into the psyches of some truly rotten people and their various romantic entanglements, there was disagreement surrounding the realism and maturity of the relationships and characters, whether the show was constantly just building up the next sexual scene, the lack of focus on the main “couple,” and the main cast's likability.  This was compounded by the differing opinions as to the show's willingness to discuss the more problematic aspects of these relationships.\n\nThe jury appreciated that Scum’s Wish judged neither the characters nor its viewers for their transgressions, and on-the-whole delivered a hopeful message about the possibility of finding true, understanding love despite your flaws. Whether a juror saw the ending as positive, satisfying, or for some characters “deserved” often played a large part in their eventual enjoyment. With so much disagreement on whether the show achieved what it set out to do, we could not conclusively place this any higher.",

Though it competed with Kuzu for 3rd place, the jury decided to reward Kuzu for its attempt at a higher concept, over Net-juu's rehashing of something we've seen before.\n\nPraised for its often unseen adult romance, as well as relatable, honest, awkward scenes, Net-juu was a cute and generally fun romance to enjoy. An MMO provided a good backdrop to connect the cast and interest the audience. Another strength of the show was its fleshed out and likable characters, of which the protagonist Morioka is a favorite. Her exasperated reactions were a delight to witness, and her development, both as an individual and in her relationship with Yuuta, kept the show engaging enough to avoid any major lulls. \n\nMembers of the jury were disappointed at how big of a role the so called “Red String of Fate” played in the show, and agreed the show would have been better without it. Outside of the main trio, the other side characters left a bit to be desired. Plotwise, its ending was acknowledged as not being quite as strong as it could have been, although it nevertheless held up rather well compared to many others in the category.",

       "writeup": "Tsurezure Children’s strength was its dynamic mix of couples that showcased various relationship styles progressing at different paces, with some confessing in the first episode and others struggling to realize their feelings halfway through the series. This was also its biggest criticism, however, with some jurors feeling as if it were spread thin between the different couples, and having few relationships or characters fully fleshed out. For certain jurors, some of the couples simply did not click. Ultimately however, the show is presented in a compact, fast-paced format with no filler, and doesn’t rely on melodramatic moments; instead filling each episode with light-hearted, sweet and humorous moments. There’s something for everyone in Tsurezure Children, even if it’s not everything for someone.\n\nTsurezure Children was widely accepted as a fun romantic comedy by the jury despite lacking the near universal support that Tsuki ga Kirei had. Ultimately, the jury preferred the narrow focus of Tsuki to the broad range of Tsurezure, while the passionate divide among the judges over the placement of Kuzu no Honkai allowed Tsurezure to snatch the number two spot, based on its overall consistent quality.",

       "writeup": "As avid followers of anime romance, Tsuki ga Kirei truly offered a refreshing take on the genre. One of the most reviled tropes in romance stories is when the main couple refuses to communicate during times of crisis or misunderstanding, which usually stalls all progress in their relationship. Tsuki ga Kirei tells that trope to hit the bricks, and at every opportunity where the show seems like it might swerve off the rails, the main characters simply confront each other and talk or text it out, as this show acknowledges that the characters live in the digital age. \n\nWhile the main characters are shy middle schoolers, their growing emotional maturity and boldness is enjoyable to follow over the course of the show. Their feelings get hurt and they get moody or jealous, but Akane and Kotarou work through things like human beings. We see them go from so nervous that they can barely speak, to awkwardly holding hands, to talking about their worries, to venting frustrations, to actively seeking and reciprocating intimacy.\n\nBeyond the relationship between the main couple, the post-episode short skits were essentially a mini-Tsurezure Children tacked onto the series, which added some romcom fun for the side cast of characters. Therefore, we view Tsuki ga Kirei as the full package for romance anime fans, and our consensus best romance of 2017.",

Added to which, the lack of focus on a lot of characters left a lot to be desired, even though the experience is like a warm glass of milk before bed.\n\nWith some attention, Konohana Kitan would be much stronger, but potential alone is not enough when compared to some of the other contenders.",

The visuals do an excellent job of creating an apocalyptic world that’s still pleasing to the eye, and a consistent audio-visual aesthetic helps the viewer get familiar with the show. This isn’t a traditionally happy show, and it oftentimes feels downright depressing, but the show’s focus isn’t on sadness. Rather, the show is about finding happiness in one’s companions and surroundings in dark times, even in small things like kneading dough or finding milk chocolate – and that theme manages to be pulled off extremely effectively.

Many of the plot points seem to come out of nowhere and leave the characters as caricatures of themselves. The final conflict and its conclusion end up feeling especially forced. The transitioning between 2D animation and CGI makes the visual experience jarring and doesn't help the already lackluster action sequences. There are a bunch of episodes that lead to nowhere and are too simple to work as interesting one-off stories. Inuyashiki seems to rely so much on its theme of contrasting individuals that it fails to really ever deliver a gripping narrative.

It features pleasingly aesthetic but undoubtedly unique visuals, a jazz-inspired OST that perfectly complements the show’s atmosphere, a solid political plot, enjoyable characters, and a mature tone and approach that’s quite refreshing in an industry where such things are quite sparse. \n\nThat’s not to say ACCA lacks flaws - the slow start may be too slow for some, and the show eschews fast-paced sequences in pursuit of its desired atmosphere. However, those are both a matter of taste. One flaw ACCA definitely does have at times is a lack of visually interesting elements, particularly during conversations between two people, which is a serious downside for a dialogue-heavy show like ACCA. \n\nHowever, ACCA’s overall consistent strength and presentation means that fans of the genre should unquestionably check it out, and even those who might not be fans might enjoy it if they’re able to stick with its pace.",

Featuring some of the coolest conceptual design work and character outfits this year, Princess Principal thrives on exploring its cast of main characters and the concepts of its world. Several singular episodes from the series are standout as one-off stories, such as Dorothy’s father’s episode or the Iinchou episode. Simply put, Princess Principal is cool.\n\nDespite this, the jury felt that Princess Principal failed heavily at conveying a cohesive or even comprehensible story with the way it was told out of order and not even given direction or guidelines. The story sort of drifts around ambiguously before a climax is rushed to in the final episodes. This lack of conclusive and coherent story is what lands Princess Principal at third place for this category.",

Despite being a rather archetypal dreamer character, we get to witness Suzu’s growth from a child into an adult as well as a wife to Shuusaku. We are able to witness the tragedy of her character when the things precious to her are torn away by the war and how she is able to continuously rise up again to live another day. Suzu’s character is about the simple victory in life: the ability to get up again. That being said, the judges as a whole agreed that Suzu is a rather simple character and that the intrigue lies in her circumstances rather than with the character herself. Of course, this simple and relatable character is the artistic intent behind her character to begin with, but the judges found it to be one that precludes Suzu from being an absolutely standout character.",

We as judges were able to weigh the entire narrative that developed over three films and eight odd episodes. And let it be known, this development was noted and appreciated. As viewers, we are able to watch the genesis of Araragi’s self destructive sacrifice and how he grew to acknowledge and accept his flawed way of thinking. From his total loss in Kizu to his redemption in Owari Part II, Araragi’s arc is explored fully and deeply. His placement in our list is based on his relative importance to his series. While we as judges do recognize the importance he plays in his show, the consensus was that both Yakumo and Rei were more integral to the success of theirs. While Araragi’s arc was widely appreciated, it was this lack of focus that led to his placement as third on our list.",

This season goes over his life as an old man as the show focuses on his time as a performer who wants to commit a lovers’ suicide with his artform Rakugo. The main conflict of the story is thus his battle with death, moving on and letting the new generation take over. Yakumo’s story arc ties in with the shows overall focus on change. Yakumo is an unchanging character, especially as an old performer. To contrast against his unchanging attitude and strive for traditionalism in Rakugo is both the ever evolving setting and the variety of characters who want to reform Rakugo one way or another.\n\nPrior to his passing we see Yakumo start to accept change such as begrudgingly letting his recorded work to be published, mostly for the sake of Shinnosuke. Ultimately, Yakumo's passing itself is the largest indicator of his inner self to accept change. He accepts that new people are around to take over and that for the artform to survive in a more modern environment it needs to adapt to the environments changes.\n\nBetween Yakumo and Rei the vote was incredibly close. The jury decided to choose Yakumo as our number one main dramatic role though due to the closure given to his character arc, how unique his character is and his overall catharsis.",

Another important facet of Rei is as the vehicle, or the “glue that binds the world together” – having such a broken character lends itself to having a fantastic world built around him, and his narration and interpretation tie beautifully in with his issues. However, some had an issue with him as centerpiece. Some found him boring, seeing his interactions as far more compelling than his character itself, while others found that the narrative overrelied on monologues, which is inextricably tied to Rei’s introspective nature. Others felt that he was by-the-numbers, failing to break new ground as the top choice did, and others felt he was overshadowed in his own show – characters such as Kyouko and Shimada were either more interesting or more sympathetic.",

Firstly, despite being counted as a main character, she doesn’t get the focus of the narrative. We see things through Shouya’s eyes and, as one juror put it, her role is to react. This makes it much harder for her to compete with so many richer and more fully fleshed-out characters. Secondly, the jury agreed that whether or not the manga did a better job, the film’s time constraints cut much of her development and characterization short. The film explained little about the external and familial pressures that may have contributed to her personality and depression, and many of her big moments felt like they came out of nowhere. While Shouko remained an unconventional and engaging character, the pacing of the movie left that character with very little room to breathe and develop. Some jurors felt like her acceptance of Ishida was too rapid, others that her depressive state hung around only to miraculously fix itself by the end. While many could relate to her and while aspects like her VA’s performance were excellent, in the end there was just not enough to her to justify a higher placement.",

Phos' journey is one filled with failures, and offered a nuanced reflection on what it means to change, to face failure, and to keep moving forward. The simplicity of Phos’s character setup allowed for considerable growth, grounding a rather alien setting through the use of universal themes, but the jury agreed that this simplicity also meant there was little appeal to Phos’s initial personality if you were not personally captivated (or even worse: if you were annoyed) by the contrast between their colorful, somewhat bratty personality and their melancholy over not having a purpose. The plot also included somewhat-too-convenient uses of memory loss which, while in line with the show's tendency to withhold information from its protagonist, also stalled progression in order to exposit to the audience. The incomplete nature of the adaptation, in addition to its particular stopping point, also meant that it was hard to point to any foreseeable catharsis for Phos, considering the many directions the show went in the span of 12 episodes. The resolution of character conflicts, as well as more focused character writing, was a quality the top three characters on this list had over Phos.",

While she took the second spot, many jurors found her to be one of the strongest supporting characters they had seen. What enables Konatsu to be such an impressive character is her role in the narrative to help explore its themes whilst also maintaining a substantial role in developing the rest of the cast mainly being Yakumo and Yotarou. Konatsu is a constant visual reminder of Yakumo’s shortcomings and regrets whilst also representing a reason for him to continue living through his depression, which enabled him to receive immense growth as a character whilst he aged throughout the series. Konatsu also never fails to take complete control of each and every scene due to her tremendous presence and fiery personality inherited from her mother. The jury agreed that Konatsu was an exceptionally written character who deserved a spot near the top of the list, as a whole however was just weaker than Kai holistically who was developed to a superior level in his show.",

Most of the jury thought that Yuzuru was written realistically and succeeded in this role, though one voice considered these various roles to be an inconsistency and fault.\n\nIn any case, her relationships, primarily with Shouya as she learns to trust and even support him, but also with Shouko, were key to her impact and development throughout the film. The consensus was that her character was likable and able to be empathized with, given her spirit and sincere loyalty. It seemed evident that a lot of what made her enjoyable was still dependant on how much the viewer was able to connect with her her personally. In summation, most of Yuzuru's contribution was in the ways in which she related to the rest of the cast. Despite likeable qualities and some development, she lacked the depth and richness of character required to place higher.",

Their interactions with Kongo-sensei were certainly unique among the gems, and their dynamic with Phos was considered a strength in the series. Unfortunately, Antarcticite's own development wasn't especially noteworthy.

In the second half of the season he becomes a major character, and his extensive development easily garners sympathy, as we get a clear view of his motivations and personality. He is a likable character—hardworking yet humble, generous yet competitive—which contributes to his appeal. He has a tremendous presence, often communicated through some excellent visuals and motifs.\n\nGoing deeper, Shimada is an essential character, supporting 3-gatsu’s narrative, themes, and development. As noted above, he receives focus comparable to the main characters in the last arc, and he is fantastic in the spotlight, starring in a compelling dramatic arc with a fantastic capstone. He doesn’t develop much himself, but is more fully fleshed out as the story allows us glimpses into his past and his perspective. He is already set in his ways, but this serves an important function; as an anchor to offer the less developed and mature characters a role model to aspire to. He also pushes a number of the show’s themes via parallelism—the physical hardship he overcomes parallels Nikaido’s own constitution—and by contrast—his cultivated talent acts as a foil to the natural talent of Rei and Master Souya.",

Nanachi’s character arc built up to a controversial conclusion, as many found it to be a satisfying end for the season, while others found it a bit melodramatic. The jurors believed that Nanachi’s lack of screen time held her back. The series only gives an introduction to her character and a few interactions. Many jurors also felt that, while Nanachi is a good character, some of her strength comes from the other characters of Made in Abyss being notably weaker in comparison. While she is certainly a good example of a supporting character, there was a consensus in the jury that she was notably weaker than the Top 4.",

She’s easily bored, and this serves as the catalyst for some of the more entertaining parts of the show. The show does a good job of showing her development throughout, and the viewers even get to experience more of her girlish sides as the show progresses. Her main role in the story as a supporting character is to foreshadow future events, and help develop the relationship between Nike and Kukuri. Juju’s development is done mostly through subtext, which left the jury divided as to her overall impact. Some failed to find her character memorable, while others loved the subtlety of her development. Overall, she’s a surprisingly well-written character for a supporting character in a children’s comedy, and despite mixed opinions overall, ultimately she lands in this spot due to her strong character development and meaningful role in the show.",

Ultimately, while he was unable to compare to Juju’s relationships with her cast, his laid-back attitude and high likability as a character helped to propel him above Nene. In particular, he made great use of the few episodes he had, with every scene having him make the most of his share of the spotlight.\n\nDespite his status as one of the joke traps of the season, he defied his stereotypes and avoided its pitfalls remarkably well. The reveal was a relief, as the “trap” aspects of his personality fell by the wayside. Instead, the way he fit into the rest of the cast became the highlight, and he acted as a springboard to help everyone try to reach the best possible humour a scene could provide. In fact, his most entertaining scenes came when it got to a point where he could no longer hold up the facade, and his more masculine traits shined through. A shockingly fleshed out backstory also provided context for his aspirations and his reason for joining the group at the cafe. Finally, his great self-awareness assisted in placing him at this height.",

Even when she isn’t on screen, Ougi’s presence remains large and influences every character in the story. Secondly Ougi works as a great counterpart for the protagonist Araragi, driving his actions in many instances and ultimately confronting him in the climax of the plot. Finally, her ominous design and presentation give her just the right feeling of grim required to make such a character remarkable. While some jurors felt that Ougi’s conclusion was unsatisfactory, the overall strength of the character, impact in the narrative, and presence within the show ultimately placed her in the top spot.",

When discussing the two Stain’s character was eventually broken down into two main components, his ideals and his world. While some loved his conviction and resolution to uphold his creed others didn’t enjoy how it was feed to us mostly in the background. Stain’s view on heroes is mostly antagonistic to the world and he holds it and himself to the same standard. The biggest debate concerning Stain was the effectiveness of his character and the impact. Some people believed that his ideology lived on, others felt that his ideology is flawed due to the nature of the world and how little of it was actually discussed, and others felt like he had no impact in the long run and his character died down changing very little. Despite the difference in opinion of impact and influence when compared to Akane its clear which is more central to their series plot. Akane has more character and pushed her show and protagonist while Stain’s influence is more questionable. Stain is a great character, but his greatest strength is also his biggest flaw. Stain’s character is so wrapped up in his ideology and makes him a strong character, but it also makes him hollow with little else. Which is why even though he is a great antagonist he isn’t quite as good as Akane and barely lost to Akane by only one vote earning himself third place.",

This consistency was driven by a character/interaction driven story. Because there was less of an emphasis on a greater/overarching  story, there was greater time left for developing the characters that were the focus of the show. SQ used this time wisely and built a town that felt very inhabitable.\n\nAgain, speaking of consistency, the main characters that made up the ensemble were given realistic goals, personalities, and expectations from the world around them. The cast was a fun bunch of people brought together by a not-to-extraordinary set of circumstances and grew together as they just tried to get through life. Other than the main cast’s consistency were their individual strengths. Each main character felt like they easily could have existed outside their place in the story and none of the their characterization felt like it was there just to progress the story.\n\nThis consistency carried over into the rest of the side characters of the ensemble as well. That is, everyone – from main character to side character/denizen of Manoyama felt like an intricate part of the larger community.\n\nEnsembles tend to thrive in the Slice of Life Genre and SQ is no different. Given the level of development given to the main ensemble and the amount of detail given to the supporting cast, Sakura Quest is well deserving of its 2nd place finish only narrowly being beaten out by Princess Principal.\n",

That is to say that the cast, as a whole was excellent in what an ensemble is best at, complementing the characters individually while also displaying their own ensemble strengths, emphasizing why they deserved each other. It is in this where an ensemble such as Princess Principal excelled at. Ensembles can only work when each not only compliment each other but prove a point to why that compliment works. It can be especially said for those episodes focused on those particular characters such as the train episode for Chise or the mortician episode for Dorothy. As if they were the cogs in the city they live in, each character must undue their own personal burdens to carry the ones of their teammates. It is in this struggle that they learn to heal and overcome their own paranoia and mistrust. From this we understand the growth of each character as related to the ensemble itself, where by the end, we see the bonds forged through blood and fire, and they acknowledge the trust each places on one another. It was to this extent that Princess Principal deserved the award above others, in both its quality of characters and ensemble caliber deserving of recognition and praise.",

While the diverse backgrounds and lifestyles of these characters bring their own individual flavors to the story  and affect Rei uniquely, there is a lack of unity in the cast. It's hard to imagine these characters acting as a singular unit, and, for the most part, these characters don't even see interactions with each other beyond those within their own respective groups.\n\nThe characters are all presented as eccentric and likable in such a way we can imagine them as real people and want to see more of their personal lives. As a fault of being adapted from an ongoing manga, though, many of these characters don't see enough screentime yet to be fully developed. \n\nSo in general, the supporting cast is strong and essential to the story, but its lack of unity is why it is placed in fifth.",

Last but not least it cannot be understated just how involved the vast amount of side characters become and all the ways they interact and cause an effect on the world at large.",

This can be best realized by reflecting on how naturally funny the show is due to the tete-e-tete nature of the gems (and jellyfish’s) interaction. The clinical efficiency with which the show fits its characters and the charm of its cast are definitely highlights, and what makes it reach 4th on our list, but its overt focus on its main character and the lack of resolutions to any character arcs outside of phos, limit it from moving further up the list.",

The show had a tendency to isolate it's cast for long stretches, resulting in characters having less screen time as a group and reducing the show's key strengths in the cast's ability to bounce off of one another and their group chemistry. Additionally, many strong characters such as Vanir and Yunyun were left to the side, and felt like they were only used for part of the show before being practically discarded. The lack of focus on characters outside of the core cast damages the ability to truly flesh out these characters to the same extent as the other shows in this category, and the nature of the episodes prevents the core cast from being used to their full potential. While the various characters of this show made for a strong ensemble in the first season, the show fails to use them as effectively in the second season relative to other nominees in this category. Other than the extenuating circumstances of Konosuba qualifying for the rankings, this would not have been anywhere near one of the shows chosen or should it have been. It had a poorly laid out ensemble with no real payoff within group dynamics. One has to wonder of any actual merit, existing beyond its popularity, that would have justified Konosuba placing in this category above any of the honorable mentions. The jury took into account the spot and how it seemed wasted on Konosuba Season 2.",

       "writeup": "The second season of the 2013 smash-hit series provides us with a opportunity to reflect on how animation is currently by seen the anime community. Back when most anime fans were young or unaware of online anime communities, people were generally oblivious to what constitutes as “good animation”, the jurors of this category included. Most fans would usually be satisfied with an action-packed “sakuga” climax. There’s nothing wrong with that as evidenced by SnK S2 earning a spot in this category. 3d maneuver gear scenes are still the biggest highlights of the series with some of the most exhilarating, high-energy cuts you’ll find in 2017. While Titan fights showcase WIT’s penchant for high levels of shading and detailing in their keyframes. But with the growing popularity of online platforms for anime discourse, the animation of anime is scrutinized far more than ever and often in the misguided form of sharing screenshots of in-betweens or zoom-ins of characters drawn far in the background. This scrutiny among a myriad of other factors leads to productions like SnK S2 to valuing drawing consistency over movement in its non-action scenes lest they risk an in-between screenshot go viral. And though not as egregious as the first season, the series regrettably must continue to use panning still shots even in action scenes as the production begins to stumble. To the credit of the animators, there are many gorgeous stills in this show thanks to WIT’s own “make-up” team that they’ve been employing since Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress. The enhanced shading and detail seen in close-ups undoubtedly has a net positive to viewers who do not scrutinize the visual aspect of their entertainment as much as many fans online do.",

The show is consistently well-animated, and with its fantastic shot composition always smooth, coherent, and impressive to witness. Outside of its consistency, the show has a tendency to produce moments of breathtaking beauty in its cinematic fight scenes, as well as capture the nuances of moments of quiet self-reflection through its delicate character animation. Its endlessly inventive nature in utilizing the blend between 2D animation and 3DCG to enhance the strength of both, with CG being used for the majority of the primary motion allowing for dynamic camerawork, weighty action and moments of true grandeur, and 2D animation being used for pre-visualizing action scenes, much of the effects animation, facial expressions and detailed close-up and character animation. Another point of commendation is the show’s comedic animation which has a punchy timing and looseness to it. With its superb highs and remarkable consistency, Houseki no Kuni is a truly immersive watch, and the runaway winner according to the jury. And hopefully the show will usher in a new standard of production for 3DCG TV anime with its successful blueprint.",

However, the jury did agree that they did a good job of staying recognizable throughout the characters' numerous transformations, and mostly enjoyed their quirky and unique appeal. The cinematography was also impressive, especially in its use of lighting and framing, and its general consistency in relaying not only its themes, but its love for the city it's set in. Its accuracy and beauty were most obvious in the ninth episode, during the visit to Kiyomizu-dera. The jury appreciated that it showed just as much effort even during the episodes that were set outside of Kyoto.

There was, however, a lack of variety and the repetitiveness of the backgrounds was something that some jurors found excessive. The grim and desolate cities juxtaposing with the cute designs of Chito and Yuuri gives insight into the structure of the show: two girls on a light-hearted journey in a dark and dead world. However, the appeal of the character designs didn't extend to all judges, as a few found them unrelatable. The artstyle of Girls' Last Tour is deeply intertwined with the show, and changing the artstyle would change the core themes of the show itself.

The jury appreciated its production value, which showed a clear appreciation towards the emotions it wanted to portray, and the series' signature unconventional visuals. In combination, these form an excellent and immersive art that compliments the story and characters quite well, due to that unique style that the Monogatari series is known for. Its quirkiness, through its ever changing and never boring style, crafts a complete picture for the audience to gaze upon and adore. Owari applies simple and sometimes minimalistic use of colours and backgrounds as a means to direct the attention of the audience. This technique was used especially well in the Mayoi Hell, which was easily one of the most visually impressive sequences of the year, and the final parts of Ougi Dark. Hitagi Rendezvous and the first half of Ougi Dark were generally considered to be much weaker by the jury. In contrast to the shows ranked above it, Owari's second season showed less originality compared to its previous entrees. With the entire franchise relying a lot on its unique artstyle, Owari 2 doesn't quite manage to beat out the top 3, that all managed to do something more with what they had.",

While this approach occasionally stumbles by interrupting serious drama with slightly off-putting comedy, the style's lows are fleeting and its highs are higher than any other show in the category. When 3-gatsu no Lion really pushes the envelope, the art occasionally evolves into abstraction that perfectly sweeps away viewers in the story's overwhelming emotion through visual storytelling and symbolism. On the other end of the spectrum, 3-gatsu's happy scenes are illustrated with such warmth and coziness that it almost feels like it could be an entirely different show, using careful lighting and color design to create a warm feeling. 3-gatsu no Lion's ability to maintain a consistent style while manipulating it to reflect the extremes of both positive and negative emotions earns it the number one spot.",

There's a sense of homogeneity in the characters, Lunarians, and backgrounds. While this could easily be a negative, the judges found that it makes the world come alive. The character designs, for instance, work within the context of the show, and there is enough that does distinguish the gems from one another. The lighting was also strong, using the CGI to create excellent effects in the hair of the gems and really shining in the winter segments. The jury gave it a narrow victory over Made in Abyss to take the fifth spot. The judges found that the show was consistently strong, without any major weaknesses. However it found itself near the bottom in a tough year as it didn't have the highs of other shows, and it frequently felt a little empty in comparison.

With great lighting that plays onto beautiful background art, showing a literal descent into darkness, a large majority of the jury felt that this was the only particular strength Made in Abyss has to offer. On the flipside, the series never seems to utilise the range in designs that the setting had to offer. More often than not, the stylistic designs of each level were one dimensional as each different iteration of the Abyss felt similar to that of the others. The character designs for our ‘cute' main protagonists Riko and Reg follow a style that was utilised in GLT, but the intended ‘impact' of sending two children into the Abyss is watered down by the complexity in the art direction. The unorthodox designs for the various monsters in the series were crafted by key animator Kou Yoshinari which offers a unique take into the development of the various environments. However, because of how the designs were handled, the creatures that appeared in Made in Abyss looked stylistically out of place and took a lot away from the viewing experience. If the standalone aspects of artstyle in Made in Abyss were to be considered, many positive statements can be made about it. Unfortunately, as a collective unit, there is simply not enough cohesion to keep the series together and it leaves the jury with a lot to be desired for. ",

The show uses symmetry in order to create shots that are soothing and easy to look at. Additionally, the show tends to contrast chaotic and ordered elements -- but when there's chaotic elements, like complex backgrounds and wires in the foreground, the focus of the scene is often something “orderly” made up of simple geometric shapes, like the stone statues, the tower blocks or the main characters. The show is subtle, but manages to fit the themes of the show and show the viewpoints of the characters. The show knows when to make the characters small in the face of the world, but isn't afraid to do extreme close-ups of the relatively simple characters. The primary reason this show is so low seems to be the understated visuals as well as the strength of the other shows in this category.",

Rakugo's second season isn't quite as interested in visual metaphors and expressiveness as its first, and it doesn't partake in  exuberant camera work with the flair of Houseki no Kuni. Where it shines most is in the details. Its use of lighting is meaningful in almost every single scene, with characters facing into or out of the light to indicate their attitudes toward whatever is discussed. The framing and blocking tell quite a bit about the story and the relationships between characters, and even the colors and transitions inform the moods that it creates. It keeps the rakugo scenes interesting visually, and its restrained symbolism provides a lot of analytical material during the rest. There's a lot of attention to detail present here, and we were very pleased with its consistent propensity to further its narrative and themes through its cinematography, but in the end it just wasn't impressive or unique enough to take the top spot this year.",

Mired in depression, the show is an expert not only at following Shaft's usual artstyle-switching craziness but also using every moment in-between to to get its point across. The camera is excellent at isolating Rei, especially in the first cour. Dark, blue lighting mixed with a barren apartment set, a particular shot that effectively repeats multiple times throughout the show with slight variations is Rei sitting in his apartment alone, looking out wistfully at the water, practicing shogi, or just wallowing in his own misery in bed. Of course, as the show goes on and Rei is lifted out of his depression, the show does a marvelous job of showcasing the warmth Rei experiences, especially with the Kawamoto family. It fills the screen with bright yellow, orange, and pink lighting, little spinning flowers at times and of course close ups of the girls, the cats, the food, the furniture, anything really.\n\nThere is a reason 3-gatsu no Lion is ranked this low, however. While the Jury agrees that any other year would see 3-gatsu towards the top of this list, this year it went up against some absolutely insane competition and doesn't quite hold up. Overall, the consensus was that despite the incredibly high highs, the show is not as consistently good as shows ranked higher, especially Owarimonogatari 2 which does a similar style better. There were also some Judges that felt the show didn't quite succeed in pulling the audience into its Shogi matches, which were anchored heavily on cinematography. In the end, it's a fantastically-made show, and its low ranking is more a testament to the Top 3's brilliance than to any major faults it may have.",

Numerous shots are either low angle or high angle shots to demonstrate varying amounts of power.  For example, Bondrewd is primarily shot in a low angle, partly because the viewer takes on the perspective of children but also to demonstrate his overall amount of power as well.  Another cool aspect of Made in Abyss's cinematography was its consistency in terms of lighting, with lighting almost always coming from above further helping emphasize the verticality of the Abyss.  Despite these positives though the show never went all out with using cinematography to help depict the world's verticality.  In terms of shot composition the mid half of the show is also more inconsistent, with far less stand out shots compared to its beginning and ending portions.  Also, compared to our other nominees, though Made in Abyss did include some interesting shot compositions, we felt like it did not provide as much cinematographic substance as our other nominees.",

The Mayoi Hell arc used imagery and cuts from previous seasons of the series, as well as imagery and camerawork that got the viewer to reflect on the journey being undertaken in the arc. Hitagi Rendezvous was phenomenal at using the camera and visuals to interweave Araragi's state of mind and his point of view with what the viewer experiences as they watch. These purposeful cinematographic approaches' effects culminate in Ougi Dark, the final arc of Owarimonogatari 2, enhancing the story and the watching experience for the viewer. However, some members of the jury felt that Owarimonogatari 2's cinematography was distracting, annoying, or too flashy to merit it a higher spot in the rankings. Owarimonogatari 2 was typical Monogatari Series + Shaft's visual style and cinematography, but cranked up to the max, which lead to somewhat divisive opinions on its placement, especially when opinions on the other two shows in the top 3 rankings were more consistent.",

       "writeup": "Houseki would not be the critically acclaimed show it is without its cinematography. Combining its 3D animation with 2D art and dynamic cinematography is what gives the show not only its unique look but also its ability to finally make 3D CGI shine in anime. Used expertly in the show's slower scenes, the camera finds itself resting in very isolating shots, emphasizing the world around said characters with them only taking up a small portion of the screen. It perfectly encapsulates the lonely feeling of this post-post-post-apocalyptic world where humans are now nothing more than a long-forgotten legend. Actions scenes, however, are where the camerawork truly shines, utilizing the show's unique 3D spaces to full effect. Close ups are used well to add tension, tracking shots to create a sense of speed and movement, angled shots to disorient the viewer during a high-flying stunt, and wide shots pull the camera back, allowing the audience to see the full glory of larger attacks. Really, the composition of every shot is so immaculately detailed and placed that taking a screenshot at almost any moment results in a picturesque, painting-like image. Finally, the lighting is something worth noticing, using complex equations to create true-to-life caustics for each gem's hair. Combined with tasteful digital effects, it can create special moments like the warmth of light reflecting through Diamond's hair as she sits by a lamp at night. The Jury agrees that Houseki is a forward-thinking, innovative anime that goes all in on every aspect of production to create the best 3D anime to date, and its cinematography is vital to its success, therefore earning it the award for Best Cinematography.",

       "writeup": "The character designs of Made in Abyss do not say much about their respective characters but rather are used to set the tone of the series. The soft, round faces of the protagonists appear very foreign in context; the contrast with the dangers of the Abyss evokes a sense of innocence or naiveté. Ozen and Bondrewd are unique in that they are humans whose designs suggest an assimilation into the world of the Abyss; they, like the chasm's natural dangers, act as obstacles for the main characters. Unfortunately their designs are difficult to animate, and bring the show to a visual standstill when on screen. The series also sports a plethora of creatures designed and animated by Kou Yoshinari. The goal of these designs was to portray an alien, dangerous presence when on screen, while still feeling like they belonged to organisms that made up the Abyss's ecosystem.. Unfortunately, because of compositing issues they contrasted with the artstyle of the characters and environments, making for some dissonance in terms of design. As far as the jury was concerned, Made in Abyss had the fundamentals of character design down but did not push further in carving out a cohesive identity through them, and suffered from a disparate mix of design elements, leading to its rank in our list.",

Additionally, jurors agreed that ACCA's expressive color palette was perfect for bringing life to its lanky, realistic style, reinforcing the humanity integral to the series and importantly serving to further differentiate characters.\n\nWith the mastery of aesthetics on display, we felt that no other show this year matched ACCA's proficiency at gracefully conveying itself through its seductively unique and outright cool character design, and it's for these reasons we consider it best of the year.",

The shading style used for the characters was also considered a positive aspect of the character art. On the flipside, it was noted that the designs' usual creativity was much more lacking when it came to characters outside of the main cast; in general they were forgettable and felt like an afterthought on the part of the creators. Additionally, the students' uniforms often weren't unique or of high enough quality to count as separate designs. While the simplistic side characters were a mark against the show's design, most of the jury thought highly of the overall design choices and the artistry displayed in those designs.",

The characters outside of the main cast also had noteworthy and fitting designs with variety in terms of shape, age and clothing style. With respect to other aspects of the main characters' designs the jury was split on whether the faces and body shapes were bland and unoriginal, clashing with the otherwise consistently appropriate style of the show, or whether the designs were unique, with one instance of \"unoriginality\" being a deliberate character design choice, as it was a major plot point. Princess Principal was hard to reach a verdict on due to the strong views held towards by many of the judges so it was only after much deliberation that it ended up in third.",

Talking about the designs itself, the gems are long-limbed and suitably alien, smartly suited up in black attire symbolizing funeral wear and highlighting their never-changing nature, this symbolic layer in Houseki's design is another one of its huge strengths. The jury would also like to give special praise to both Phos' change in design as she undergoes development (the kintsugi in particular is a brilliant touch) as well as the buddhist iconography inspired Lunarians and the jellyfish based admirabilis. \n\nDespite all this effusive praise, it was never in contention for the first spot with ACCA being the runaway winner, with its homogeneity in design being one of the jury's key gripes despite the show's efforts to mitigate that narrative and economic necessity.",

It is therefore not strange to find it nominated as one of the best character design displays of the year, though the jury did have several issues with it that kept it from ranking higher. While variety is generally a welcome trait in a show's design, a large issue was the way in which the number of characters in Boku no Hero Academia ended up hurting it from a character design standpoint, as an expansive cast inevitably meant that many characters were aesthetically unappealing and even came off as lazy or unoriginal at times, which in turn demonstrate a lack of consistency among the cast's designs. Still, the jury considered the candidate's highs as well as lows, a primary one being the many great designs that reflected the quirks of the characters both in terms of power and personality, which edged it above MiA.",

Minami goes to great lengths to truly make the city look appealing – from the sheen on the worn stone steps of a temple to the lush greenery of a hilly mountain path, the series often felt like it was putting more effort into its background work than anything else. \n\nUnfortunately, many of our jurors felt that the series' strengths were too occasional for their liking; Minami's best work is scattered and mostly presented early on – those beautiful scenes in the first few episodes are rarely matched by the end of the show. Additionally, several of us felt that the saturated colors utilized to present the setting in a good light became counterintuitive, with scenes sometimes being overbearing and difficult to look at. On the whole Minami certainly knew what it wanted to do with its backgrounds, but stumbled too often to rank higher than fourth. ",

The use of the same imagery albeit different for every scene becomes pretty repetitive as the show moves along. But one thing it suffers from the most that the jury agreed on is its emptiness in every background. The mostly empty backgrounds don't look as interesting to see over and over. Also there's no way to distinguish locations from each other other than very specific structures or features. The backgrounds are pretty the first time around but it's emptiness, along with the heavy repetition of scenery makes for a boring background with stellar animation in the foreground. ",

Each layer's exterior created a feast for our eyes as a setting, showing designs inspired by both exploration and human imagination. The background art accentuates these themes. However, the jury felt that it didn't fulfill its potential, as its backgrounds became more repetitive the more time the characters spent in each layer; each set of imagery can only stay original for so long before its appeal becomes stunted and wilts. They falter towards the end especially, although even then they still hold onto those unique qualities of exploration and awe. We examined every bit of how Made in Abyss presented its setting, and while we appreciated its initial efforts, we thought it became too comfortable in its groove of showing its detailed backgrounds mostly during establishing shots, refusing to visualize other aspects of the unique ecosystem of the Abyss that we felt could have been shown more often, with more variation, and in more detail. While we believe Made in Abyss does deserve a placement in the best backgrounds of the year, it didn't do quite as well as some of the other entries for these reasons.",

The images themselves also do a good job of highlighting some of the main themes and story beats of Warau Salesman New. Unfortunately, as fun and stylish as this OP is, the Jury felt its relative simplicity held it back. This was a competitive year, and Don't just didn't have what it takes to stand up to the fantastic production values and narrative structures of the higher-ranked OPs. Furthermore, while the meaning behind many of the images matched the show itself, its artstyle definitely didn't. It ended up as a weird, juxtaposing introduction that ultimately fails to smoothly lead into its show.",

The song was considered grating, albeit certainly savable had they simply had an actual vocalist doing it and not the voice actors. The animation isn't much better, with a vague narrative for about twenty seconds then devolving into a dozen pointless cuts and shots that have very little if any connection to each other. The OP supposedly is trying to focus on the relationship between Regu and Riko, but doesn't manage to sell it in any sort of effective way. Stylistically it doesn't show anything that you wouldn't be able to find in the show itself, and much like many other forgettable OP just feel like a compilation of scenes rather than a music video paired to the song. The lack of timing, dull visuals and composition, and poor vocal performance made this OP feel like something that, to us, shouldn't have been on the list.",

Additionally, we felt that the utilization of a dual Ougi concept was strong, and these visuals were more than enough to solidify its place among the top openings of the year. Judges agreed that the song was no slouch either, with its engaging J-pop production, nice performance by Mizuhashi Kaori in character as Ougi, and lyrics that play with pronoun usage and which serve to further teasingly illustrate just what connects Araragi and Ougi.\n \nUltimately the jury felt that this was a strong opening in classic Monogatari style; however, just as the imagery is compelling in its simplicity, an overreliance on that simple imagery and its flat, dark palette, plus some poor timing in the visuals, wonky animation, and lengthy cuts that felt almost as if SHAFT was padding for time, held dark cherry mystery back from placing any higher than fifth.

Loaded to the brim with sexually charged visual elements and references to the story (and even source) paced together to fit the absolute jam of a track makes for an OP absolutely packed with content. This OP moves incredibly well and combines music and visuals to create a symphony of fast paced madness. The incredible color design manages to combine the colored fruits and fishes in their blue/green background, and the interesting lighting and shading makes these all blend together beautifully well, as well as making the red of the uniforms really pop out. Transitions and camera moment is used to really make it feel like all scenes in this OP are shot with a single camera. It feels like a glimpse in the madness of Kakegurui itself, and all the characters involved.\n\nDespite its many strengths, what keeps Kakegurui at the bottom of the top three is that with the references to source material, fast cutting and overall hectic feeling of the OP, it sometimes feels too cluttered to be considered above the other two.",

Unlike Deep in Abyss, very few jurors spoke completely against it, but no one really defended it being much higher on our ranking, either. Most jurors accepted that it was a fine OP for a shounen action series, but it doesn't attempt to excel far beyond that. Jurors commented on how it mostly succeeded at telling a basic \"hope and prepare for the future\" narrative that aligned with the tournament arc that this OP's episodes contained, with the characters stretching and Midoriya aiming towards the sky/All Might. The animation was also on point, especially with how it progressed to action with the build-up of the admittedly awesome J-rock music. The characters were also summed up pretty well, with each shot of them stretching used to tell the audience something about their goals. Still, the issue with Peace Sign wasn't that it did anything poorly, but rather that many of the jurors struggled to think of anything remarkable about it. Some expressed their boredom with the OP, and others said that they would have preferred if the OP's climax were earlier so that less precious time would be spent on set-up with the characters stretching. Overall, in comparison to the OPs higher on the list, Peace Sign is basic. That's fine, but the jury widely agreed that most of the other OPs nominated were both more interesting and better executed.

A beautiful song done by the VA for Miyokichi fits both the tone and time period of the show, while also having a lot of interaction with the visuals. It starts with a slow build up to the point where Yakumo falls off the cliff, and slows back down as he splashes into the water below. The song moves into a happier chorus as all those involved in Yakumo's life reach out to him, but it shatters along with the record that they were standing on. The visuals also do much more beyond song interaction, telling the story of Yakumo's character as season two starts in just the ninety seconds the OP is allotted. The ticking clock throughout to signify his time is running out, throwing himself off a cliff as he is prepared to die, as well as leave his family behind him, as shown by turning himself away from both Yotaro in a rakugo theatre and the others involved in his life on top of the record. The OP nears its conclusion with the beginning visuals being played in reverse, causing those close to Yakumo to turn away from him, and ends with Yakumo smiling as his candle goes out, much like the Shinigami story he likes to tell so much. Even outside these examples, there is still so much more to this OP that we don't have enough words to say, further exemplifying that this is one of the best OPs we've seen in a long time.",

Less intense sections allow for the philosophical ideas of the show to be highlighted, but playtime is never far away. Ugoku, Ugoku provides the world with a priceless treasure: cute anime blobs dabbing. Credits are well integrated and easily readable; at times creating vectors which sync with the music and are often part of the world itself. The use of bland colors and distortions found in older films help to portray the degraded, desolate world that the girls explore. This is contrast with the repeated use of vibrant spirals, as the girls try to find value in the everyday. While distinct beats in the music demand for synchronized movements of the pair, less emphasized sections allow for more expressive character animation. Although they are always together, the girls have very distinct personalities, shown through the sporadic movements of Yuu and slow focus of Chi. The excellent transition shot of the weapon firing blasts into the chorus, causing urban environments spring to life - the shot of the pair underneath the car a standout. \n\nUgoku, Ugoku is a fantastic OP for the show, setting the tone with thematic strength. This OP has some minor issues holding it back however. Jurors noted audio-visual sync near the beginning is slightly off. The jury would also have liked more visuals representing key ideas explored in the show.",

Most shots follow a formulaic set up of focusing on meaninglessly strung together action shots, as well as character shots for the sake of showing off the character design, which causes the overall narrative to somewhat get lost which is a negative.

It's a fantastic tune that's catchy and addicting, a cute SOL number which stands out for some of it's fantastic animation and incredibly interesting cuts, such as the \"Code Kanna\" being animated and moving outside of Kobayashi's screen while she's at work; the scene where Elma's face lip-syncs to the lyrics while being cut from some sort of stick is also quite intriguing. Aozora works as a fantastic tone-setter for the show and sets up the mood for the show quite well, but it does have some flaws that prevents it from rising higher.\n\nOne of the big flaws of Aozora is what it does to represent the show, the cuts doesn't hold much importance in regards to the general narrative or representation of the show and while they are visually interesting and engaging, they're unique simply for the sake of being so rather than following some sort of stylistic continuity. Other shots like Saikawa at school or Kobayashi at work feel generic and don't say much about the characters. The opening does set up and play up the comedic parts of the show decently well, but the show isn't afraid to touch on more sentimental and emotional subjects and it feels like the opening fails to represent that part of the show.",

Jurors also praised how the ED tells a cute self-contained story about alien acceptance. This ED may have actually told Urahara's story better than Urahara itself did. The song was also widely acclaimed for its jazziness, especially with how the instruments and vocals matched the ED's climax of the alien's surprise party being thrown into a literal spiral. The special [halloween version](https://animethemes.moe/video/Urahara-ED1v2.webm) is also a very nice addition. \n\nUnfortunately, multiple jurors took issue with the ED's pacing, highlighting that certain shots dragged for too long. Certain visuals felt off-beat with the song, and some shots just felt like padding to get to the good stuff. Granted, that good stuff was totally worth this ED being nominated, but altogether the pacing and cohesion flaws held the ED back from the top 5 of the year.

Of those that found the ED unfitting, jurors were split again on whether this was to its benefit (for the sake of contrast), or not. Tabi was generally criticized for its misrepresentation of relationships in the show, though this was necessary given the style of ED and the desire to minimize spoilers. While it lacks narratively, the presence of Eternal Fortitude flowers, eventually settling as a bed in the final shot, provide a solid visual link for the character's journey in this ED and the show itself. The falling sequences that lead to the bed are well fit to the extended vocals, contrasting rapid cuts that accompany shorter, more distinct percussion and vocals. Consistent character animation was appreciated, though at times both it and the transitions felt out of sync with the music. \n\nFor Tabi to place higher, a rework the ED's key goals may be required, though some execution improvements and additional narrative tie-ins would help as band-aid fixes.",

       "writeup": "With its lovely illustrative storybook style and wonderfully fitting melancholy accompanying track, the judges agreed that Kafune is a strong and evocative ending animation, effectively representing Rei getting dreamily lost in thought about his place in the world, showing his softer, more childlike side. Shot-by-shot there's a lot going on here: the visuals utilize the classic 3-gatsu water motif with aplomb and we're treated to Rei picking himself up and moving away from tough aspects of his life – there are tons of interesting tidbits hidden away in this very Little Prince-like ED. Musically, the quiet indie rock vibe of Brian the Sun's single fits the imagery perfectly and with wonderful timing, and we felt that it contributed well to make the ending feel like a cohesive experience.  \n\nUnfortunately, the at times obfuscatory nature of the visuals confuses the narrative a bit and weighs it down with some unnecessary vagaries, and as judges we generally agreed that this weakened the overall effect of the ending animation. Some of us also felt that it didn't distance itself far enough thematically from other 3-gatsu openings and endings, which held Kafune back from placing higher on our list.",

       "writeup": "Overall the judges was generally in agreement that Toumei na Tsubasa may be the most well animated ending of the year. Toumei uses a vivid color palette akin to watercolor and the animation is fantastically fluid, this comes into play when the transformation sequences begin as they flow into each other endlessly without coming off as jarring, which is an impressive feat. How the animation interacts with the various objects on screen and allow the colors to flow into one another was well received and it was a nice touch to make the ending so reliant on transformation magic as a representation for Akko's character.\n\nThe divisiveness for this ending theme came from the musical score which some judges felt made for a great accompaniment to the visuals, while others felt it was unfitting in some regards. Another large divisive point was the narrative, which is incredibly simplistic, some judges found this beautiful and seemed to enjoy the simplistic nature of the ED's narrative and the subject matter it had to tell, while others felt as if the narrative became thin as a result, which put it below some of the better EDs on this list.",

The soft rock track that was chosen accompanied by simple visuals that matched the tone of the show did a great job at leading out of Sakura Quest, allowing the viewer to wind down along with the characters. Regarding the visuals themselves, there were mixed reviews, trending negative – almost all decried the very simplistic shots with minimal animation, some even referring to it as the barest minimum above a slideshow, while some found meaning in the each of the simplistic depictions. The subjects themselves were mostly agreed to be pleasant – the sunrise and sunset as bookends did a good job at emphasizing the day-to-day routine into which Sakura Quest delves, while the characters themselves fit due to the character-driven nature of the show.",

The judges were in agreement that the visual representation of Cinnabar and Phos was incredible through the use of the limited color palette. The ED was filled to the brim with symbolism correlating to the show, such as the smeared paint forming into hands and reaching out for one another, which accurately represents the distance between Phos and Cinnabar that they both wish to close. The visuals aren't exactly representative of the visuals in the show itself, but rather proves quite effective as a standalone style by Kuno Yoko. The song itself was quite divisive however, with some judges finding it beautiful and fitting, while others found it largely forgettable and bland.\n\nMost of the negative criticism regarding the ending theme was directed at nitpicking things such as certain cuts not syncing up ideally with the music or how, while interesting, the ending wasn't very fun to look at if you don't enjoy symbolic endings. It did receive a fair bit of flak for its transition sequences however, which at times could be jarring and break the visual experience slightly.",

Yuuki Aoi does an excellent job with portraying Tanya in the ending and the most agreed upon sentiment regarding this ED, was how her voice acting performance coupled with the flurry of cuts using inverted color in the intro and outro were brilliant and captured the essence of Tanya's insanity quite well.\n\nRealistically speaking however, the ED consisted basically only of still pictures with no animation. The ED largely depicts Tanya doing everyday things. The art is well-drawn, but there is no animation, thematics, symbolism or anything else to speak of in the entire ending. There's no narrative that presents itself from the pictures, which causes the ending to feel overly flat and ruins the potential it had from the voice acting performance by Yuuki Aoi. With such flat visuals in most regards and no big visual strengths to make up for what the ED is lacking in other areas, it's no surprise that this placed last on every judges write up but one.",

Paired with easily one of the catchiest songs of the entire year sung by the VA of the dragon girls themselves this ED is absolutely packed with personality and communicates their own daily lives and what they care about through calendars, stickers and pictures. Tohru doing chores, Kanna at school, Elma at work, and Lucoa… doing whatever Lucoa does. On top of that this ED absolutely breathes the idea of communication with a clever use of speech bubbles and text messaging that are very well incorporated into the song's tempo. The chibi dragon girls singing in the middle is adorable, and overall this OP is a very fitting one for the show. What's keeping it fairly low on the list is the fact that there's an overall lack of cohesion. It uses both the theme of daily life and of communication but fails to combine these. The panning shots of characters living their daily life are cute, but rather unimpressive and lack motion. Despite the fact that this ED has certainly no major issues, it also doesn't do enough impressive or unique things to make us want to place it any higher.",

Following what appears to be a single day in the life of the girls, the ED really manages to capture both the simple joys the girls are able to find in the ruins of the world and sell the intimacy between the two. Shots like the one with Yuuri dancing then cutting to Chito banging on Yuuri's helmet really just endears these two girls to the audience and tells you everything you need to know about the duo's dynamics. The ED takes on even more significance for potential manga readers, foreshadowing a number of events that happened in the series past the end of the anime, while still being vague enough and inserted well enough to not be intrusive to those less-involved in the series. \n\nOutside of being thematically fitting, the ED is gorgeously animated, and being drawn by the author really makes it feel like putting the manga in motion, with its very sketchy pencil style and manga-like composition. Due to the cohesion of both the song and visuals, and just how damn fun it is, More One Night was easily the jury's pick for best ED of this year.",

The kaleidoscopic visuals are not only unique and interesting to look at, they provide a lot of visual metaphor for the ever-changing relationships that occur throughout the show. As each new hand joins, or couple pops up due to shifting the kaleidoscope, a new flash of color is added to the screen to show their happiness. However, as they all begin to layer on top of each other, they become muddled, forming a black mess in the middle of the screen. This combined with some much less subtle sexual imagery has Heikousen getting its themes across just as well if not better than any ED this year.\n\nWhat knocks this ED off the top spot is that while it does what it wants to do extremely well, the themes associated with the ED were quite simple in the end, and its kaleidoscope style isn't applied in very many ways leading to a slightly repetitive visual experience. Some jurors thought that the ED lacked the substance that others provided, while others argued that the sexual themes presented have been done so many times before that it knocked the ED down a couple spots on their lists. Still, Heikousen provides a fantastic visual and thematic experience that was executed as well as it could have been, but just didn't provide enough to earn the top spot. ",

Rakugo is a anime that very much depends on its voice actors to succeed. To be able to distinguish yourself in that kind of show, when you have someone like Akira Ishida co-starring with you, is an absolute amazing accomplishment and worthy of praise on its own.

Yuuki does a great job of displaying unbridled rage, and indeed has some moments that better showcase her range—such as when she deceives the enemy with the voice of an innocent child.\n\nIn the end, we sought to recognize performances with a bit more nuance, but that didn't sacrifice standout moments.

Obviously, part of this is the fact Phos themself goes through a fundamental shift in personality towards the end of the series, but this does not dilute the quality of the performance itself, a perspective most jurors shared.\n\nSeveral jurors also compared Phos to Kurosawa's work as Kumiko in Hibike! Euphonium, with most praising the range of emotions conveyed in a very muted fashion. Similar yet distinct emotions were captured through small noises, utterances and moans of exasperation, which received a mixed but overall positive response. Whilst some judges were happy with this level of precision, some judges expressed the sentiment that it denied Kurosawa the chance to engage in more technically polished vocal performances throughout the series.\n\nIt is, however, the aforementioned shift in character that elevated Phos to being near the top. Most judges praised Kurosawa for accurately capturing the transformation Phos goes through, and making it pleasant to listen to.",

Things such as adding reverb to the background instruments to add depth of field or capturing the percussive sounds of a piano hammer hitting the string stood out to some jurors adding some interest to a couple of tracks on the OST. The Jury also felt that the OST did a great job of catering to the intimate nature of the show, with its heavy use of piano, which made for a cohesive and consistent OST. Emotions such as lust and desire as well as loneliness were noted as being expressed particularly well, as well as a sense of apprehension and pressing conflict. Despite this, there were some problems that kept the OST from gaining a higher position than it got. With its cohesive sound, sometimes that cohesion was a bit too much with some jurors feeling that some tracks blended into each other. This was particularly noticeable when similar emotions were being explored and similar instrumentation was being used. The jury also felt that there was a lack of variety in the OST, with only 1 or 2 tracks feeling unique compared to the other OST’s where there was a range of tracks and styles used.",

       "writeup": "The jury describes the Little Witch Academia OST as a fun and quirky soundtrack that fits really well with the similar nature of the anime’s world of magic and witches. Beautifully orchestrated and rather cinematic tracks that take influence from Western cartoons and media, almost instantly setting the tone for what is happening on the screen or for what is about to happen. Even the non-cinematic tracks straying away from the classical orchestral style also display a level of compositional competency to create contrast while still matching the nature of the anime. Another aspect of the OST that the jury noted is the motivic development of Chariot’s theme throughout of the anime—setting the theme’s melody to many different moods and using it during moments of Akko’s development creates a cohesive soundtrack that ties in well to the story’s progression.\n\n\nWith all this said, the jury overall feels that this OST’s strong points and utilization aren’t as strong as the OSTs above it. While LWA has beautiful orchestration and instrumentation, Houseki no Kuni’s use of it is more intricate with its craftful combination of East Asian and Western instruments. While LWA works well with tying into the magical and whimsical world of the anime, Girls’ Last Tour does a much better job at enhancing the anime’s world with its atmospheric and playful musical setting of a post-apocalyptic environment. These shortcomings leave this OST to have weaker and less impactful tracks compared to the top three OSTs in our ranking.",

The show uses tone shifts to make every emotion compare more powerfully to the one before, and its OST is one of the biggest factors in why it makes this work so very well. Tracks are charged with atmosphere and emotion to immediately put the viewer in the right mood of the scene. It creates a tonal consistency between tracks despite using a varied range of styles and instruments, and can use music to convey specific emotions to the viewer down to the last detail. It conveys a range of emotion varying from Comfort to emptiness, from relief to regret, and from soothing stressful. Through its use of these tracks alongside each other, every episode becomes a range of different emotions and atmospheres, and even listening to the OST outside of context every track can immediately put you into a certain mood.\n\n\n3-gatsu no Lion’s use of OST is powerful, but the same can be said for other entries on the list (though arguably to a lesser extent). However what’s holding 3-gatsu no Lion back is the technical impressiveness of the OST that lies a tad below others, as well as the fact that despite its variety in both positive and downcast tones, it never seems to master either of them. It’s fantastic at both of them, but master at neither.",

While much of the instrumentation and melodic/harmonic devices are repeated throughout the OST, composer Kenichiro Suehiro masterfully uses each element of the soundtrack to its full potential, creating a score both consistent in its beauty and thematic resonance as opposed to becoming a blur of identical sounds. It’s telling that a show so focused on the human race highlights one of the key aspects that makes us so unique: our music. It’s not all desolation and isolation though, as the soundtrack is intelligent in its use of brighter tonality and releases of harmonic tension to create happier, comfier moments, just like how Chii and Yuu find moments of comfort and joy in their long trek across the barren wastes. Overall, the Jury agrees that Girls’ Last Tour’s soundtrack shines brightest among our nominees, perfectly encapsulating while also enhancing the atmosphere of the show it accompanies.",

The music simply never misses a beat, giving an amazing sound to reflective character moments, or even comedy bits, but where it really soars is during the incredible action sequences. The orchestration here is fit to score the grandest of big-screen fantasy epics as energizes the show’s incredible action sequences, but there is also a palpable sense of tension that is missing from many other action series. A major reason for this is the way the soundtrack, as well as the show itself, creates a terrifying presence for the main threat of the story: The Lunarians.

Roughly half of the judges had it around their top picks while the rest had it at the bottom half of their rankings for OST. The largest disagreement arose on how well MIA’s OST captures the tone and fits the setting of the show. While most – if not all the judges supported that MIA’s OST had a very strong composition and individual track strength, some judges felt very strongly that the OST didn’t represent and intermingle with what was occuring on the screen as well as others. Tracks work wonderfully individually, but being put in context of an episode it sometimes lacked cohesion or identity. Some argued this lack of consistency didn’t make it feel like an OST made for the show as much as the ones above it. Compared to Girls’ Last Tour and Houseki no Kuni’s OST, it lacked the spirit and identity that it needs to really capture the essence of the show, and kind of ends up feeling like, despite being a very strong OST, it could’ve been used in other context and be just as strong. Other judges – the ones that held largely favorable opinions of the OST – believe that not only did the OST succeed in supporting the actions on the screen, but also captured the ominous yet captivating nature of the Abyss. The OST’s combination of conventional and unconventional music choices resulted in one of the more memorable soundtracks in recent memory. In a year not as ridiculously strong as this, it may very well have been an easy winner.",

       "writeup": "ACCA 13 was a fairly divisive show amongst the judges that often found itself among the top or bottom of judges' lists with no in-between. The consensus seemed to be that the plot was the main draw – the show utilized gradual reveals to allow for appropriate foreshadowing towards a very fitting denouement. One judge pointed out that the viewer often felt just as confused as the main character and quasi-narrator, Jean Otis, about the coup and his role in it, which gave the show and its grandiose plot a surprisingly organic feel to it. While judges personally felt somewhat varied about the plot, particularly the conclusion, most praised it for its ambition and execution, even if they themselves felt no resonance.\n\nThe characters – the heart and soul of such an ensemble drama - were somewhat of a mixed bag, however: while many praised the colorful and unique designs that breathed life into a very subdued world, many felt the characters felt very shallow, almost caricatured, or convenient, existing solely as plot objects. The settings drew similar opinions – very interesting and varied, but somewhat shallow, design proved very divisive, which was disappointing in a show that ostensibly had a very positive message about multiculturalism and unity.\n\nUltimately, the show was seen as somewhat novel, in that a slow-burn political-intrigue thriller is not something common in the medium, but it had notable drawbacks for some - the glacial pacing caused some to lose interest, especially during its original airing, and the visual storytelling was viewed as often poor and contrived, a high crime in such an intrigue-based drama.",

       "writeup": "A quiet and contemplative show punctuated by bouts of horseplay and song, Girls' Last Tour was a surprise hit for many last year, including some of our judges. Its particular juxtaposition of a post-apocalyptic setting with charming and comedic slice of life came across as resonant in its human authenticity, and in particular the jury felt that the way it blended a philosophical look at the end of both life and humanity with mostly delightful character interactions only served to make the series' effect more poignant. At times healing iyashikei, at times a sobering look at very humanistic failures, and at times a deeply personal outlet for the original creator's own worldview, the jury for the most part felt that Girls' Last Tour executed on its themes strongly and clearly – and sadly, some of our jurors felt, a bit too obviously – giving us an incisive look at getting along with the feeling of hopelessness. \n\nIn terms of production, as a group the jury agreed that Girls' Last Tour had fantastic cinematography, a stellar soundtrack that was used well, and wonderful sound design; on the other hand, some of us criticized the series' lacking visual compositing, aged digipaint art style, and unfortunately underutilized character animation. It speaks to the strength and resonance of the core material at hand in Girls' Last Tour that, despite the complaints, it still comes in fourth on our overall ranking for the year.",

       "writeup": "Tsuki ga Kirei takes a rather standard approach to the romance genre and executes on it in an extremely satisfying way. The judges praise for Tsuki ga Kirei lies in the spot-on execution of its mood and depiction of what it felt like to be in middle school, an extremely relatable premise to start with. The romance starts early in the series and the ever-so-common misunderstandings and non-communication clichés of the romance genre are swept to the side with writing that feels organic and natural for these kids with a delightful payoff. The show also features some uniquely competent storyboarding and directing ability that is a bit of a surprise compared to how the rest of the show looks.\n\nPraises being sung, the judges also had a number of critiques of Tsuki ga Kirei. Outside of the competent directing, the show's visual aspect is incredibly lackluster with janky CGI, budget animation, and odd-looking backgrounds that seemed to clash with the artstyle of the characters. The characters are given hobbies and aspirations, but don't seem to have distinctly unique personalities or any real chemistry together at all. Not to say that the awkward nature of the romance isn't endearing in itself, but it never evolves beyond that point until Kotarou's final declaration at the very end of the series. Ultimately, Tsuki ga Kirei executes its romance well but has plenty of room for improvement, which is why it finds itself at 8th place.",

       "writeup": "Kyoto Animation is back at it again, giving us a fun Slice of Life anime with great production values and a little bit of depth added in. Themes of family, love, and belonging are sprinkled throughout the show, using various relationships both romantic and platonic to represent different types of love and a place to call home. These include a significant other, a mother and her child, a best friend, and a roommate. Mix that in with a deluge of comfy home-life scenes and plenty of comedy, and you get the melting pot of joy that is Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid. Unfortunately, for all the show does right, the judges felt there were a few problems that held it back. To start, some didn't appreciate the comedy and felt it actively got in the way of other, better elements of the show. Some also found certain characters to be problematic, bringing down the scenes they were in or just generally being underutilized and underdeveloped. Finally, some thought the little splash of serious drama in episode 13 came on too suddenly and resulted in too much of an upheaval in the show. Regardless, most if not all agreed that Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon was a quality SoL that deserved to be nominated for Anime of the Year, even if its various flaws kept it from being ranked higher.",

Despite the characters in Konosuba being one's a viewer could easily deduce to simple archetypes they all bounce off each other so well and create an entertaining team to watch.  Konosuba isn't trying to be deep, but it also doesn't need to be to entertain the audience and make it a fun watch.  The writing is mostly what makes the show funny, however this season the character animation department went the extra mile in allowing characters to go off model.  Largely for comedic effect this change helped heighten numerous funny scenes.  And despite Konosuba being a comedy it manages to achieve high levels of hype such as during the finale episode.  \n\nMost of the jury however believed the jokes in Konosuba to be too repetitive and uninventive.  Many felt as if they were watching a rehash of season 1 and also that it wasn't as strong as season 1. The jury also felt that even though Konosuba was good at being a comedy there was not much more to Konosuba other than that.  Granted, the jury recognized there is merit to being a good comedy, however the jury overall agreed that the other nominees on this list managed to take on a higher variety of tasks and do them better.",

       "writeup": "3-gatsu no Lion contains a stellar combination of well developed characters, unique character designs, an emotive soundtrack and beautiful cinematography that helps make it an overall fantastic show. 3-gatsu's focus on Rei and his varying mental state is the definite highlight of the show as 3-gatsu manages to perfectly combine audiovisual elements to describe Rei's feelings in any given moment. The way the show tackles Rei's depression as omnipresent and inescapable in his life is expertly done. Even without Rei outright stating it, through the cinematography alone the viewer can tell which places Rei is happier and which he is sadder as the environments he is in reflect his emotional state. For example, Rei's apartment tends to be lit with a somber, blue light. He is usually alone and the apartment tends to be shot in wide. These elements give the viewer a sense of emptiness and sadness which Rei feels while he is alone with only his thoughts to keep him company. In contrast to his apartment, at the Kawamoto home Rei is basked with a warmer light and the frame is constantly filled with people. Without words the show is able to convey Rei's varying emotions with immense amount of detail.\n\nDespite all the positives though there are numerous shogi matches that either go too in depth making the stakes of a match hard to keep up with or are boring to watch due to a limited amount of varying shot compositions. And though the show looks fantastic there are certain SHAFTisms that don't fit with the overall tone of the show such as the constant use of the over-the-shoulder SHAFT shot. Thus, due to these inconsistencies in both visuals and story the jury placed 3-gatsu at 2nd place.",

The show masterfully utilizes the pursuit and upholding of an artform to develop its fantastic cast in surprising ways. Perhaps most notably, the show brilliantly champions the art of verbal storytelling by twisting the narrative of a man being haunted by both his past and his future. Rakugo isn't just a story; it's a story about stories, and we admired Rakugo's audacity to play with audience expectations. Multiple jurors even praised Rakugo as one of the most well-executed stories they had witnessed from any anime. Rakugo's second season also remains intoxicatingly charming, drawing viewers into its rakugo performances through exceptional direction and voice acting. For an anime about a relatively obscure artform to Western audiences, Rakugo does everything in its power to make viewers fall in love with its subject matter, to the point where seeing the decline of rakugo is as heartbreaking to viewers as it is for the characters.\n\nAlthough the jury was divided on whether or not this season was an improvement over the first season due to some gripes regarding the first and last few episodes and Konatsu's character arc, most applauded the show for its avid dedication to its subject matter.  Rakugo isn't just a love letter to a dying performance art, but also a love letter to anime storytelling, and we are proud to announce it as our pick for the /r/Anime Awards 2017 Anime of the Year.\n",

This makes it, in addition to its high quality animation and soundtrack, one of the more engaging entries of its type in modern days. While the series provides some decent emotional payoffs playing off themes of lineage and the master-student relationship, as well as some engaging and genuinely creative action scenes in simple yet effective contexts, the series falls short in offering much more, specially for those that aren't into its particular niche. New characters and perspectives about the setting are introduced with a severe tone-shift to convey that they mean business, but are quickly sidelined to give space to the next low-stakes action arc in school. This lack of commitment to follow these threads through, or settling for a particular tone, reveals the story's insecurities on what it wants to be. It poses grey questions about the morality of heroes, points out that there are flaws in how the setting's institutions are built, like if it was trying to hook up more mature audiences that would be interested in these topics. It does so by being self-aware, yet it chooses to fall back to being a lighthearted and optimistic action series to keep its main target audience in. This lack of identity and poignancy in most aspects that aren't subjected to its niche are what ultimately leaves Boku no Hero Academia ranked 9th.",

Studio Orange's debut full TV 3DCGI anime took most by surprise with its unique production qualities, featuring not only some of the most interesting cinematography of the year thanks to the tools given by CGI, but also some very expressive character animation. While not perfect, the show's production certainly gives a lot to talk about, but this elegant simplicity comes rather from the show's setting. Categorized by objective qualities of their material composition, the characters are only really threatened by the Lunarians. Fighting then, is the duty of the strongest. The search for a fulfilling role in this society is something deeply humanizing that Phosphophyllite, the main character, who is also the weakest of the gems, has to deal with. The show then becomes a succession of Phos meeting new characters, learning things about the world, failing, changing, and failing again with consequences increasingly impactful, yet still moving forward (not really knowing where, but still doing so), persevering in the face of failure. \n\nYet, as a series, the show falls short in delivering satisfying closure to most of its points of interest. Things about the world are explained in sometimes heavy handed ways (particularly at the beginning) while other ones are implied subtly, we learn more about the gem society but there's almost nothing that pays off from it, outside Phos' development. The anime, as an adaptation, takes liberties that make it work in animation, going for a more bombastic approach that's awe inspiring at its best, but completely mismatching the tone and intent of entire scenes at worst, some of the agreed reasons as to why it's not ranked higher than 3rd place.",

The characters, if they can even be called as such, rely on mere gimmicks which revolve around two ideas: being stupid, or hating those that are. A character like Yoshiko, the titular ‘Aho Girl' of the series, is simply that - an idiot - she has no other defining characteristics, and her existence in the narrative in the first place is questionable at best. The comedic tone shifts may work once or twice, but as the series settles into its formula, one that encompasses all aspects of its comedic execution, one gets sick of its tiresome repetition, cringe-humor, abuse, and incessant screeching from the characters. Truly, Aho Girl is a dreadsome mess of a show which easily falls below other shows which, while not necessarily amazing or even good themselves, certainly aren't as outright incompetent and unbearable as this show tends to be.",

This is a short that is aesthetically pleasing to look at, filled with vibrant colours choices, breathtaking background art and a fitting tune to accompany the interactions between Kase and Yamada. Unfortunately, this short lean further towards the spectrum as a AMV, which hindered its ability to compete with the short-forms that were nominated. Although it is needless to say that as a short that is only five minutes long, it would be a shame to not give this a go!",

       "writeup": "The most effervescently charming movie on this list, Lu over the Wall is acclaimed director Masaaki Yuasa's attempt at making a children's film and return back to his roots of working on kids anime like Chibi Maruko-chan and Crayon Shin-chan. It's not the most original of movies with its heavy homage to 80s cinema and clear facsimiles in E.T. , Little Mermaid, and Ponyo, but with its stylistic presentation that blends its visuals and soundtrack with supreme editing (comparable to Edgar Wright in style). However due to the fairly familiar territory the movie explores, the jury found the main characters' development to be trite and by-the-numbers, which were slightly alleviated by its strong integration and anti-discrimination message as well as the neat callbacks and overall tightness of its plot, but it wasn't enough to place this fun, charming and nostalgic movie higher than 4th.",

       "writeup": "Yoru wa Mijikashi Atukeyo Otome, or The Night is Short, Walk on Girl is our pick for the movie of the year, and it's not really that hard to see why. While this year was a strong one for anime movies, there isn't one that manages to be as inventive, as creative, and as brilliant as Walk on Girl. The atypical, classically Yuasa artstyle meshes beautifully with both the eclectic sound track and magical realism genre to create a work that is impeccably consistent with its presentation. Another concept that the jury kept coming back to was uniqueness – a college atmosphere, its screwball comedy and wild musical segments, and even the nature of the ‘romance' are all very unusual choices for an anime movie, and thus made for a very refreshing change of pace. The film also does a fantastic job with callbacks and parallelism, to both Tatami Galaxy, for which it is a spiritual successor, and to itself – the constant string of references and actions weave a beautiful web that really breathes life into the town and characters. Finally, the movie covered a lot of content and arcs while still managing to feel reasonably paced overall, which enhanced the experience. While almost every jury member found a flaw in the film, including a somewhat disjointed, three part structure, somewhat shallow albeit fun main characters, and thematic inconsistency, none of these were enough to overcome the substantial positives of the film.",

       "writeup": "Kono Sekai no Katasumi ni was a movie that had immense thematic power that was marred by some other issues, preventing it from reaching the top spot. The most obvious theme is that of the destruction inherent in war, particularly on the homefront – a theme explored heavily in literature although not usually on such a personal level. It also explores memory as it pertains to traumatic events, as we see the story in greater detail closer to the event of [](/s \"Suzu losing her arm\"). \nUnfortunately, it had a number of issues. The slice of life portions drew mixed reactions in the later half, but the earlier half was almost universally disliked. The characters were generally thought of as superficial, although one judge found this charming. A consistent opinion was that many interesting threads were left unexplored, making the movie feel short of its full potential Even among the threads that were explored, some fell short in execution.",

The jury praised it on its visuals and animation, feeling it is the best looking Monogatari entry. We also felt that it served as a great resolution to the Vampire Koyomi arc, with Araragi’s realisation of Kiss-Shots true nature being a scene that stood out in its execution and impact.\n\nDespite this, there were quite a few problems the jury had that kept Kizu III from moving higher in the list. Firstly, the jury felt that with Kizu III being the 3rd installment in the series, it relied too much on the other 2 films to help it stand. While it did lead to a great resolution to the arc, it lacked a self-sufficiency that detracts somewhat from the experience. There was also annoyance at the fan-service scene with Hanekawa. We felt it went on for too long and wasn’t really necessary to the story. That isn’t to say Kizu III isn’t a good film, since most of the jurors enjoyed it but with more flaws than positives overall, it finds itself in 6th place. ",

The visuals were unanimously viewed as the key strength of the film, along with the soundtrack, and the first half was widely agreed as being quite strong. However, the judges found that the two leads were fairly basic as characters, and it made it difficult to get especially attached to them, lessening the impact of several key scenes. This led to a conclusion that was fairly underwhelming for many of the judges, though there were a few who found it to be a fulfilling end to the story. In spite of being near the bottom of the list, the overall consensus wasn't that the movie was bad, it's simply a movie with a number of flaws that hold it back from being as strong as it could have been.",

       "writeup": "Koe no Katachi is one of the only films of its kind which explores the repercussions of bullying and the impact it can have on anyone involved. The character arc and growth of Shouya is one of the strongest parts of the show as it showcases his genuine remorse of his decisions as a child which ruined the next few years of his life and many surrounding him. Yuzuru is an extremely well written and likeable character who has her own troubles on top of looking out for her disabled sister and watching her develop is really heartwarming. The movie handles its themes to an impressive standard and is a very realistic and touching redemption story which is able to emotionally impact its audience in many ways. The movie is really beautiful to look at to be expected of Kyoto Animation through the use of fantastic character animation and imagery. What the jury felt made it feel lacking compared to some other entries on the list is some massive pacing issues due to the compression of the manga resulting in countless scenes feeling rushed or inadequately set-up, as well as several being altogether skipped which ultimately lead to the lack of development for a large portion of the supporting cast leaving them with a lack of depth and almost no purpose in the film itself. Reaching a decision on the placing of this film was tough due to the differing opinions of most judges so we ended up reaching the conclusion that third place was a fair representation of our various stances on the film.",
