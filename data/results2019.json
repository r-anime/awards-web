Among all these Action anime were those that stood above the rest, whether in animation, direction, narrative, or characters, and the jury aimed to pick those to represent the best that the year had to offer.\n\nAmong the highlights of the year, there were anime with raw, unfiltered combat like *Kengan Ashura*, and anime with a great narrative using unconventional fights to great success, like in *JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Golden Wind*. There were anime like *Cencoroll 2*, that let the animation do the storytelling, and anime that had battles both inside the self and out, like *Mob Psycho 100 II*. Many anime were filled to the brim with style, like *Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba* and *Fire Force*.\n\nThe jury's job of narrowing the vast pool of options down to four nominations was not easy. Many discussions were had about potential nominations, culminating at the end with some shows being culled with a tearful eye. At the end of the process, the jury felt that they had come up with the best representation of the many quality Action shows to release this year.",

          "writeup": "*Kengan Ashura* is a show that focuses on its core strength - exciting and varied action. Throughout its runtime, the show consistently impressed jurors by its ability to provide variety in the form of showcasing a large number of different fighting styles duking it out in the main tournament arc that takes up the show's runtime. Jurors also found that these scenes made effective use of the show's CG, allowing for detailed bruising and other damage to remain consistent between shots, allowing for high complexity in design. Outside of these scenes, many jurors found the CG used to be stiff and choppy in animation compared to the action scenes, although still appreciate the attempts at visual variety in style that occur. Outside of this action, some jurors found aspects of the show lacking - while many appreciated the plot's simplicity in setting up the action, some thought it could have done more with its corporation premise. Moreover, some jurors found that dialogue present in the action scenes grating, and mostly serving as a stiff repetition of the events without much addition; although appreciated at moments due to how it helped explain the finer details of obscure fighting techniques, more often than not it served as a detraction. Overall, while its strong focus on action made it one of the more striking and memorable experiences of the year, its other elements held it back from realising its full potential.",

Jurors praised the show's unique premise and intriguing world, both greatly enhanced by the flexible artstyle that lent itself to the unpredictable fights of the show. The characters were generally well-received, as all the characters were fun and enjoyable to watch, with great chemistry and clear characterization, even if they needed a bit more time to develop more distinct personalities. *Cencoroll 2* answers many questions viewers may have had coming in, and the world and its logic is explained in an interesting and satisfying way. The show sets itself up for future sequels well; for each question answered, the show raises two more. The main attraction of *Cencoroll* are the creatures, which all have distinct and creative powers that play off each other very well and create great action scenes. The animation again does a great job and the creatures feel like they belong in the world, but are clearly different from each other. The story does as much as it can during its short runtime, and the jury felt it deservedly garnered second place for being a fantastic start for something hopefully even better.",

          "writeup": "*Fire Force* is a brilliant looking shonen battle series hampered by its rather weak storytelling.  Starting off with a novel monster-of-the-week premise that is equal parts *Hellboy* and *Back Draft*, the series quickly pivots into a government conspiracy that seemed more interested in playing with its growing cast of characters rather than exploring its unique setting. \n\nThe consensus opinion is that *Fire Force* was a missed opportunity. For an action show, *Fire Force* delivered on some of the best looking fight scenes of the Fall season. In the later half, the quality of the battle sequences improved immensely as the pacing of the fights were more focused on the moment-to-moment action (while not betraying the atmosphere with tonally dissonant cut-aways). On the other hand, the cast is the weakest thing about this series, as too many characters are introduced too quickly and none are given proper room to develop. The heavy use of fanservice was also a divisive element in the series, and was often the source of debate on whether its inclusion came at the expense of more dramatic moments.\n\nUltimately *Fire Force* was a fun romp of a show with plenty of room to grow in its next season.\n\n",

          "writeup": "*Dragon Ball Super: Broly*, the sequel movie to the *Dragon Ball Super* anime, is an action-packed movie with beautiful visuals and a great canonisation of the popular characters, Broly and Gogeta. Overall, the Jury gave much of the movie's praise to the production and choreography that went into the universe-shattering fights this series is known for. The story begins in the past with the origin of the Saiyans broadening out the Dragon Ball lore and providing a basis for connecting the storylines between Goku, Vegeta, Broly and Frieza. While this origin story was great for Dragon Ball fans, casual watchers of the movie will have a hard time staying engaged in the film during the first hour. \n\nAs mentioned before, the production that went into the movie was a standout; the art looked gorgeous, and the animation was smooth. One issue the Jury had with the animation was its use of CGI on backgrounds and characters. Though the CGI did a good job in looking similar to the art style, it still looked uncanny, leading to moments like the Vegeta and Goku duo attack looking far more disappointing than hype. The OST's in the movie were decent, but a certain OST in the film had taken away some engagement to the fight. Finally, the fights in both this movie and the *Dragon Ball* franchise was the biggest hook to the movie. The multiple non-stop fights, each with their own style, kept each fight interesting and engaging, making an overall engaging movie.\n",

As a direct follow up to the anime, the movie was able to capture the feeling of a world war really well. Detailed explanations on topics such as supply lines, manpower and war strategy increased the overall immersion of the show. While giving such details, the movie manages to stay in line with its well-toned comedic moments. Thanks to this balance, the story was fluid and easy to follow.\n\nSpeaking of the story, new villain Mary Sue offers a different perspective compared to Tanya. This lets us see the different sides of the same coin. This duality enhanced the story of *Youjo Senki*. That being said, the movie had its shortcomings. Some of the action scenes in the movie were intense and enjoyable to watch but it wasn't consistent because of the heavy reliance on CGI. Most of the jury felt that the sound quality took a step down compared to anime as well.\n\nOverall *Youjo Senki Movie* was a nice addition to* Youjo Senki* universe and one of the best action shows of 2019. Due to handicaps in the production department however, we decided to place it on the fifth spot in our list.\n",

We particularly noted the fun and tense action, tear-inducing humor, tear-jerking emotional moments, and stellar cast. The cast was actually the most praised aspect of *Golden Wind*, and several jurors were pleased by the fact that the entire cast was introduced in the very beginning, which gave us plenty of time to appreciate them. Every member of Team Bucciarati was lovable and fun to watch. We couldn’t help but enjoy every interaction between them! Outside of the main cast, it was also noted how well-characterized most of the villains were, particularly the members of La Squadra. In regards to the many fight scenes, jurors adored how Araki wrote every Stand to be especially unique, which allowed for more tactical battles as opposed to standard “get close and punch” fights. But of course, there is no such thing as flawlessness. Jurors couldn’t help but notice how oddly paced the beginning of the story was, referencing character flashbacks in the middle of fights. Something else that was brought up was the rather confusing nature of the final arc, despite an exciting conclusion. Nevertheless, these points weren’t enough for the jury to not receive *Golden Wind* with a very positive reception. Thanks to a fantastic cast and remarkably clever fight scenes, *Golden Wind* stands as a worthy entry in the *JoJo* series, and a worthy third place in Best Action.\n",

The action scenes littered throughout the show were animated extremely well and had tons of impact. The CGI implemented into the show is some of the best usage of CGI in the industry. The plot development was quite good, but some felt the pacing was a bit too slow overall. There were also some issues with excessive monologuing in what would otherwise be tense scenes.

While this and how the final act did not manage to capture with the same fervor as the earlier ones lead to some questions about which season was better, *Mob Psycho 100 II* was never not the frontrunner for the category. The show's visual inventiveness and how it uses its art style to its fullest gave it some of the most expressive and impressive animation sequences to date. Yet despite its amazing visuals, its characters are what take it to the next level. It manages to convey a number of interpersonal themes to tell a very human-centric story amidst all the supernatural shenanigans. The primary messages about people needing people and how you should always give people a chance to change are narrative throughlines that appear prominently throughout the season. Mob's sensitivity to others is portrayed as his greatest asset and the people he helps, help him in turn for a virtuous circle of empathy and growth. And Mob isn't the only one to grow, the show doesn't shy away from showing that all these characters are human and flawed. Reigan, in particular, has his best and his worst are on display throughout the season yet Mob pays the favor back by showing him that the person he really is, is much better than the person he pretends to be. In summary, holy shit that Mob Episode.",

Even the initial task of winnowing down the field to four shows complementing the public's picks felt like a monumental endeavor considering the breadth of eligible entries from 2019. While some of the jurors may have a specific show we liked that didn't get in, the jury generally felt that the eight nominees in this category represent the best of what Adventure/Fantasy had to offer.\n\nThe moods, settings, characters, and stories of our shows could hardly have been more diverse. *Vinland Saga* showed us the visceral brutality of the Viking era while *Slime* encouraged us to embrace our inner Sid Meier. *Hugtto Precure* inspired us to find and pursue our passions while *Dr. Stone* celebrated the towering achievements of human curiosity and innovation. The results here reflect a long process of discussion, debate, and some measure of disagreement about the quality of all the nominees. While not always a harmonious process, we came to understand and appreciate each juror's opinion, and the final rankings reflect our collective feelings on the entries considered.",

While the main anime was aimed at publishing his work in the form of an easily digestible show that carries the tone and themes to a wider audience, the OVAs are mostly aimed at fans of the manga which feature unadapted material cut from the anime’s production.\n\nThe OVAs carry the same sense of humor, character interaction, and writing quality as the parent story, with the same unique touches such as the notable VA work and Kenichiro’s soundtrack. However, the visual presentation is a bit rougher compared to the regular production with some hits to animation and art quality in particular. On the plus side, the third episode of the OVA features hand-drawn bears instead of the regular CGI bears used throughout the anime broadcast. Since the OVAs are three episodes placed in different spots of the story, they’re not quite as strong when viewed by themselves as opposed to placing them in the correct spots within the story thus complementing the greater work.\n\n\nThe jury felt that while it was a good watch, it was not as strong of an entry compared to other nominations, which were fleshed out with higher episode counts and generally better production quality.\n",

          "writeup": "Loosely adapting Nagabe’s graphic novel, Wit Studio’s *The Girl From The Other Side* is one of the more unconventional entries on our list. It’s about two characters struggling with the difficulty of their coexistence against the longing for intimacy, resulting in a distinctly bitter-sweet story. Clocking at under 10 minutes, it conveys the original’s Grimm-like atmosphere of a haunted yet beautiful fairy tale with just cinematography and motion, no words necessary. \n\nIts use of colour, textures and a doodly style of animation are all reminiscent of co-director Yutaro Kubo’s previous works, and they really give that “children’s book brought to life” feeling that makes the whole thing visually striking. Coupled with a music-box-like soundtrack that reflects what’s happening on the screen and thoughtful use of sound effects, it resembles the surreal aesthetic of soviet cartoons, which plays well to the type of story the short tells.\n\nThe jury unanimously loved the artistry and poetic quality of this entry, how it was able to convey complexities of the two characters’ relationship with no dialogue. Due to its brevity, it was difficult to decide just how exactly to rank it against the rest of our entries, and ultimately its lack of volume in the story department was the main reason why most jurors didn’t choose it as their number one, and thus it settled on a respectable second-place spot.\n",

Different aspects of the world and its characters are teased over time in ways that can feel captivating.\n\nThe CG models were an obvious sticking point for the jury. They can take a bit to get used to, especially with how stiff and janky the models can look during the action sequences. This action, when combined with the lethargic way they move during quiet scenes, was enough to take some viewers out of the experience. Wakaba's curiosity drives the narrative, but at the same time, his willingness to go along with everything and his constant wonder left him as an odd focal character who was met with a mixed reception.\n\n*Kemurikusa* tends to show things that  invite questions, while also giving pieces of the answer and only later the context to make those answers salient. This slow-burn style leaves room for the viewer to dwell on and speculate about what certain things mean, which, if successful, helps hold attention to the mysteries of the world. One question left to ponder is how the senses are seemingly split amongst the sisters whereas Wakaba seems to have all of them despite lacking a Kemurikusa. As a package, while *Kemurikusa* managed to provide a unique experience, its glaring flaws kept it from being anyone’s favorite.",

While for some this filler was fine and enjoyable, the majority found it to be not nearly as interesting and knocked it down some in the face of tough competition.

Watching as Rimuru builds a country out of what used to be just a handful of goblins and then witnessing that small village become a grand city known throughout the land was exciting to watch. This all goes without mentioning the exceptional visuals which most of the jury appreciated, especially in the first half of the show.\n\nDespite having some fun qualities, *Slime* still did feel fairly formulaic with an overpowered protagonist who could not lose along with a pretty standard video game isekai setting. Due to these aspects of the show, the jury was split between those who were underwhelmed by the lack of dramatic stakes and how standard it felt, and those who had enjoyed it despite this due to how well it utilized its strengths. Between the jury, it was fairly unanimous that the beginning of *Slime* started strong with this emphasis on the building of the Jura Tempest Federation. This was followed by some of the later arcs dropping off a little due to issues regarding pacing, a decline in visual quality, and a shift in focus away from this emphasis on building the Jura Tempest Federation.\n\nThe jury ended up placing *Slime* at 5th place due to how enjoyable the show was to watch for the majority of its run, however, its flaws held it back from placing higher with more consistent and original anime like *Vinland Saga* or *Totsukuni no Shoujo*.\n",

Hyakkimaru and Dororo’s journey to defeat demons and take back Hyakkimaru’s body was simple yet effective in engaging the jurors. Most enjoyed the bond between the two leads, praising the show for its ability to stay entertaining with only one speaking main character for most of the show’s runtime. \n\nFor the majority of the show, the production was beautiful; muted pastel backgrounds and striking fight animation were highlights of the show. *Dororo* was at its best when following the main duo journey through Sengoku-era Japan fighting demons and making connections with others. The slow, melancholy trek across the beautiful washed out setting contrasted with exciting bursts of animation created a great balance in the show. The jury agreed that the show stumbled in the second half, as the main conflict felt rushed and uninteresting at times, despite asking thoughtful thematic questions about the nature of sacrifice. At times, the show would dedicate half an episode to a side story while rapidly advancing the main plot, and the jarring pacing was paired with a decrease in production quality throughout. \n\n*Dororo* reached some of the highest highs of anime this year, with many standout episodes, but the show was unable to stay consistent. The show’s erratic pacing and dip in production quality during its second half held it back, but  picked  back up during the finale—a spectacle of gorgeous animation that delivered an emotionally and thematically conclusive ending to the story of Hyakkimaru and Dororo. The jury felt that *Dororo’s* small stumbles in the second half kept the overall very solid and entertaining show from a spot higher than a respectable third place.\n",

There was also praise for how the show portrayed the progress of scientific advancement back up from the stone age to the modern-day and how that impacted the lives of the villagers. \n\nThe main problem the jury had with the show was Tsukasa’s inhuman strength, noting that it was in stark contrast from the rest of the show which prides itself on scientific realism. Many also felt that Tsukasa wasn’t a good villain and that the start of the show suffered because of this, making it the weakest part. However, they agreed that the story picked up once we moved on to Senkuu’s interactions with the village. Some mentioned the arc with Senkuu’s dad as the highlight of the show, citing how inspiring and wholesome it is.\n\nOverall, *Dr. Stone* is a show that excels in its portrayal of science and celebration of human achievement. The jury felt it wasn’t exceptional at much past that though, leading to its 4th place in this category.     ",

Likewise, the contest for the dubious honor of eighth place came down to a close vote between *Shinchou Yuusha* and *Isekai Quartet*. Most of the shows in the middle of the pack came down to one or two votes separating them from the anime above and below them, so if just a couple of  minds had been changed, the order could easily have been completely different. With how tight this race was, it’s clear that we had a wealth of great comedies in 2019.",

          "writeup": "With its unique setting and premise supported by a lively art style and production, *Dumbbell* offers a fun look at workout culture through the lens of a solid CGDCT show. However, mixed feelings on the presentation and the show mostly playing it safe prevents *Dumbbell* from placing higher in the rankings.\n\nOne aspect at which *Dumbbell* especially excels is its production, which boasts a colorful artstyle and attractive character designs. The animation enabled by these designs (during both exercises and daily life alike) helps the show stand out, with a variety of locations and outfits also helping the visuals stay fresh throughout the season. The comedy itself is decent all around, with the self-aware humor being the highlight of the comedy for many. The cast is likeable enough and Hibiki in particular stands out thanks to a strong debut VA performance from Ai Fairouz.\n\nHowever, the core of the show was less unanimously loved. Some thought the cast had a good amount of character depth, others thought they stuck to their superficial traits. In addition, the messaging of the show is muddled; the more positive themes of “work hard” and “do your best” are weakened by their juxtaposition with sexual fanservice and unhealthy fat-shaming. The niche premise also makes the characters and setting less universally relatable and the educational segments hurt the pacing of the show. This is why *Dumbbell* ultimately takes 6th place in a strong category, despite a good showing overall.",

          "writeup": "*Isekai Quartet* takes characters from four recently popular anime and introduces them to an everyday setting: the classroom. Fantastical worlds colliding in this way offers plenty of opportunity for laughs, as strong and memorable personalities come together under the same roof. The show’s chibi designs and simple aesthetic mean that it relies on its content, whether it be the comedy or the prospect of seeing your favorite characters interact in a way heretofore only possible in fan works. The show has incredible popular appeal from its inception, but much of this potential is wasted. \n\nWhile each of the component shows’ casts is strong in their own right, the combination is met with limited success. While most of the cast is well-suited to *Isekai Quartet*’s skit-based comedy, certain characters, such as the secondary characters from *Youjo Senki*, don’t fit in well. If the show had presented more interactions between the strong characters available to it, it would have been successful in achieving the comedy fans were hoping for. Instead, *Isekai Quartet* leans on the well-trodden humor of its constituency series for laughs but fails to incorporate the principal elements of each show’s humor, lifting only the most superficial jokes and gags.\n\nThere are a couple of standout moments where the show realizes its potential such as Kazuma and Subaru comparing their experiences or Ainz and Tanya bonding over being isekai’d, but aside from these scenes, the show is hurt by its reluctance to break up groups of characters whose dynamics are already well-established in their own shows.\n",

In all seriousness, *Hitoribocchi*’s warm, wholesome aesthetic, and its kind-hearted portrayal of a middle-schooler struggling with social anxiety is what puts it into the top half of this category. As the show’s main narrative focus, Hitori Bocchi and the comedic nature of her anxiety are the highlights. The show exaggerates her personality and the absurdity of her thought process for laughs but is able to do so without putting her down, allowing the audience to laugh along with her and enjoy the way she grows as a person.  This style works hand in hand with the anime’s large, ever-growing cast of characters, and while specific cast members came off as gimmicky to some, it’s never too much of a drag on the show. The growing nature of Bocchi’s friend group keeps the situations that she is put into feeling fresh and new, and plays well into what the show has to say thematically about friendship, acceptance, and the differences between others.\n\nThat all said, the show’s premise, which centers around Yawara Kai, and especially the way the show seeks to redeem her partway through the season, unfortunately works against the thematic ideas it is going for and felt confusing and needlessly cruel to Bocchi to many on the jury. That, along with the slower pace of its comedy that some felt was sluggish, kept *Hitoribocchi* from making even more friends.",

          "writeup": "*Cautious Hero* was a strong nomination for comedy, delivering some of the most hilarious gags of the year. Ristarte stands out as the character driving most of the comedy, playing an unusual role as both the straight man and the one acting crazy. Her reactions, over-the-top voice acting, and animation steal many of the scenes she’s in. The use of the Divine Realm not only as a launching point but also as a fleshed-out location that the party returns to again and again makes for an interesting twist on the setting.\n\nWhile many felt that the jokes and premise showed potential, some of the gags are incredibly repetitive. Naturally, most everything relates to Seiya being overly careful, but the comedy doesn’t evolve much from the initial jokes. This weakness extends to the sparse utilization of side characters who have little impact on the plot or the comedy. Mash and Eruru may have started off as serviceable gag characters, but they don’t do much after their introductory episode. Incorporating a dramatic reveal near the end of the show to recontextualize Seiya’s behavior is a surprising and somewhat refreshing idea, but it’s introduced too late in the game to be fully convincing. Some felt that the show would have been better off sticking to the absurd comedy. When it does lean into that absurdity, *Cautious Hero* is at its best, contending handily with the rest of the category.",

Its strength is drawing on its large cast of zany characters to create hilarious situations that are absurd in the most grounded way possible. Every character is a trope, to the point that the cast gives each other genre-savvy nicknames like Baka or Chuuni. The characters occasionally break out of their mold as they interact in believably mundane ways, but mostly the show focuses on rotating in different members of the cast to create new and potentially hilarious combinations.\n\nUnfortunately the overall production quality of the series, beyond a creative OP, is unremarkable to poor. This puts the appeal of the show entirely on the shoulders of the characters, and should their personalities or interactions not entertain, the show’s appeal diminishes. Jurors who disliked some of the more divisive gimmicks, such as Baka’s loud and abrasive personality or the extent to which Loli’s immaturity is played up, tended to come away with less love for the show. Nevertheless, the wide variety of characters and situations means that there are always jokes that land, or character tropes that succeed in facilitating them. Additionally, the show is good at imbuing the story with positive messages such as embracing weirdness in others, and certain episodes break away from constant gags to showcase affirming interactions, such as in episode 11. \n\nThanks to a strong, varied cast and laugh-out-loud wacky comedy, *Joshikousei no Mudazukai* finishes at a powerful third place.",

          "writeup": "*Machikado Mazoku* stands above most of the crowd in an incredible year for comedies. The show takes the formula of “magical girl versus demon lord” and flips it on its head so that our bumbling protagonist Shamiko is the demon struggling to overthrow a magical girl in order to free her family from a binding curse.\n\nThe charm and comedy come largely from the fact that Shamiko is hopelessly incompetent but has a heart of gold. For a demon, she doesn’t have much of a demonic bearing, though for that matter Momo doesn’t make for much of a villain herself. Instead, much of the “conflict” involves Momo taking pity on a worthless Shamiko and training her to be an actual threat instead.\n\nThe jury praised *Machikado* for its fast-paced comedic dialogue, its color design, its use of background gags, and most of all for Shamiko herself and her relationship with Momo. Shamiko is infectiously positive, and it’s a delight to see how this starts to change Momo’s own perspective. Assisted by the stellar voice work of **Konomi Kohara**, Shamiko is fully realized as a pitiful bundle of earnestness who is difficult not to root for.\n\nIn the end, the show could not edge out Kaguya, but *Machikado Mazoku* was perhaps the only other show in the category without many serious detractors. Some jury members voiced concern that the side cast was somewhat underdeveloped and underutilized, but ultimately the jury came away from the show with an overwhelmingly positive opinion of it.",

Opinions across the jury were varied, but most agreed that these two entries were inconsistent at times. The show had the potential to be better if it had focused more on some of its stronger cast members and utilised its amazing comedic timing more frequently. There is some interesting drama as Saiki is internal conflicted about keeping his psychic powers but eventually realises that his friends will always be there for him regardless of the decision he makes. At the same time this plot point makes for an arguably jarring shift, given that it requires stepping away from what the show’s existing strengths are, such as utilising its wide and varied cast to keep its comedy fresh. \n\nNew additions to the cast were another key point of discussion. The teacher is a mostly unnecessary addition to an already strong cast, and didn’t bring much in terms of hilarious gags, or interesting dynamics with other characters. On the other hand, Suzumiya is a great inclusion, and many of her skits compete with the best of the series, especially those that feature her dynamic with Satou. \n\nIn the end, the franchise's conclusion features plenty to love as well as several weaker elements, which results in a middling ranking.",

Its comedic timing and delivery are excellent and jokes fit the setting perfectly, but that would be nothing without the remarkable chemistry between our main characters. While Kaguya and Shirogane go through mental battles and misunderstandings, the fan-favorite Fujiwara upends their plans with her particular brand of chaos. A simple formula, but incredibly effective. Ishigami and Hayasaka were favorites among the jurors despite diminished screentime.\n\nA-1’s production was also praised across the board. The show is able to transform simple ideas into over-the-top sketches, like when a game of 20 questions becomes a cowboy-style shootout. Exaggerated facial expressions and reactions are always fun and stand out even more due to fantastic voice acting, especially Aoi Koga’s performance as the titular character.\n\nAs a rom-com (emphasis on the “com”), romantic development is slow and subtle. The focus is on the comedic situations of the romance rather than the romance itself, which allows for a strong and dramatic conclusion to the season. Despite the show’s sudden romantic shift, the fireworks scene is surely among the best in anime.\n\nNothing could supplant *Kaguya-sama* in the jury’s mind, which is why it is the best comedy of 2019.",

There were a plethora of shows worth highlighting this year, and the Drama jury attempted to do the category justice.\n\nHowever, the process leading up to the results was intense. The fervent discussions about what anime the jury should nominate or whether the jury should nominate any anime at all, the spirited in-depth breakdowns of the reasons why the jury liked the shows they did, and the multitude of perspectives each show was watched through made this category hard-fought, with results to match.

Although Kitaro Kousaka’s delivered consistent animation quality and cinematography throughout the movie, it fails to reach the same production standards as his earlier Ghibli works, and the top contenders of this category.\n\nAfter losing her parents in an accident, Okko moves in with her grandmother at Hananoyu Inn, where she befriends a ghost and starts her role as a junior innkeeper. While *Okko’s* disjointed nature received mixed reception, most jurors enjoyed the movie structuring its narrative around the inn’s diverse group of guests, and despite the final arc being slightly rushed, it gave us a cathartic ending sequence. Each guest represents loss in their own way, and it’s through their interactions with Okko that they recover from their loss and help Okko do the same. The jury had mixed reactions to the cast, with Okko and Glory being widely regarded as highlights. Fitting the inn’s mantra, “The water of Hananoyu rejects no one”, the movie was rejected by no one, but had fewer supporters than the entries ranked above it.",

The finale really embodied all the positive qualities of *Tsurune*, wrapping them up into a thrilling and exciting match that made you hold your breath all the way through.\n\nOverall, *Tsurune* definitely has some great positives, particularly the KyoAni effect and the ending, but the show doesn’t go above and beyond in terms of a sports anime, making it one of the lower placed shows in this category for the jurors.",

Building on the characterization of the world via the background art, the lively animation and sound production lent authenticity to the experience, while cinematography was used to direct the viewer’s focus with so much vying for their attention. \n\nHowever, in other aspects, it was a rather contentious entry. Many jurors didn’t appreciate the structure of the film, feeling it was a disjointed series of vignettes that failed to form a coherent narrative, with an unlikable protagonist to boot. Additionally, a few considered its portrayal of parenting and family life unrealistic and perhaps even harmful, feeling like Kun was effectively neglected and his mechanisms of learning were unhealthy.\n\nOthers held an opposing view, believing that *Mirai no Mirai* perfectly showcased the trials of parenthood and the difficulty of maturing, finding it reminiscent of their own experiences both as children and caretakers. Similarly, several jurors had a significantly different reception to the story, being captivated by the film’s dreamlike atmosphere.

Taking second place, reception leaned positive, but there was notable dissent.\n\nAll in all, *Sarazanmai* had a spectacular production. The animation, art style, and OST were all called out by jurors as exceptional, with some going so far as to call them best in category. That being said, some jurors took issue with the fairly extensive use of recurring scenes, although other jurors enjoyed how they provided structure or were subverted over the course of the series.\n\nOf course, a solid production alone wouldn’t be enough to receive second place. The script was also generally praised, although there was some dissent. In general, the script was most powerful in its thematic consistency and development achieved through extensive use of motifs and foreshadowing and backshadowing to recontextualize events over the course of the series. \n\nThe narrative itself received much more mixed reviews, with some finding the latter half of the series to be substantially weaker despite a strong first half. Others took issue with some of  the mythological elements - often they seemed a bit excessive and disconnected from the rest of the narrative and were thought to detract from the show by distracting from what it does best.\n\nThe characters were incredibly divisive. Every juror saw fit to comment on them, and the comments leaned positive, but while many found the characters very well written and sympathetic, others found them trite and unrelatable. Enta, in particular, was found to be a weak link in the cast.\n\nOn the whole, the jury came to the resounding conclusion that Ikuhara is NOT a hack fraud and that *Sarazanmai* was one of the best drama anime of 2019.",

Some in the jury found themselves wrapped up in the strong character drama as Sakuta faced the realities of this movie’s heroine, Shouko, and his own role in her fate. The way that Sakuta’s heroism affected other characters, namely Mai, showed the strength of their relationships and how Sakuta’s self-sacrificing nature could adversely affect those who care about him. \n\nThe way that the ending affects the stakes of the character drama and the film’s overall mediocre production quality became some downsides which kept it from placing higher in the rankings. The way Shouko wove herself into Sakuta’s personal history was interesting for some, and confusing for others. The build-up of Shouko’s character was also found to be disappointing. Still, in the face of fierce competition, its strong themes earned its inclusion in the top 8 dramas of the year.",

          "writeup": "*Fruits Basket (2019)* is the long-awaited retelling of the classic 90s shoujo manga. The textbook setup of a grieving but optimistic girl moving into a house full of pretty boys unfolds into a tale exploring the universal facets of love, the importance of empathy, and the struggle of personal growth. Its messages of found family, self-acceptance, and how kindness always begets kindness resonated strongly with viewers through a multitude of characters facing trials on both a personal and systematic scale. The story is pure chicken soup for the soul that pulls on your heartstrings with more emotionally complex and nuanced character writing than expected. That being said, Fruits Basket lands right in the middle of the group for the exact opposite reason as our fourth placement, *Okko’s Inn*. \n\nAs one of the more divisive entries in this category, it received equal amounts of passionate support, indifference, and disappointment among the jury. While half of us found Tohru’s warm and accepting nature to be the driving emotional core of the show, others thought she lacked enough agency or range to be truly compelling. The shifting tones between serious character moments, silly slice-of-life antics, and foreboding mysteries were another source of mixed opinions, as well as the series’ handling of its most dramatic emotional beats. Lastly, supporters and dissenters alike noted the series’ structural receptiveness and relatively underwhelming production values.\n\nDespite the mixed jury consensus, *Fruits Basket* is a pipe dream adaptation beloved by many, and its placement reflects that it’s up there with the best that drama had to offer in 2019.",

          "writeup": "*Run with the Wind* is about a team of 10 athletes taking on an insurmountable running challenge, competing in the Hakone Ekiden - a prominent relay marathon. The main cast are colorful characters with personalities and mannerisms that make them genuinely feel like a group of friends. Through the show they face their own hurdles that culminate in a final arc that allows each of the main characters to shine and see how they’ve grown. Despite great chemistry and character arcs, some of their reasons to start running felt weak in comparison.\n\n*RWTW*’s themes are well executed and rather refreshing. The characters are aware of their limits and the futility in striving to be #1. The show also sets a tone on the limits of hard work in life/running, that success is not simply perseverance but also talent, experience and luck. However, *RWTW* suffers from the same thematic realism it tries to portray when it uses a couple cliches that don’t match the tone or message of the story.\n\nThe OST by Yuuki Hayashi elevates and gives life to the anime. Cinematography and production worked well, running was depicted beautifully with finer details. Character designs are sharp and the great voice work enhances the personalities of the characters. At times the visuals can look more mediocre with larger groups and background characters.\n\n*RWTW* has minor problems, but to dwell on them would be a disservice to one of the most impressive shows of 2019. *RWTW* leaves such an impact it will have you thinking, “Do you like running?”",

Between its complex and nuanced characters, innovative 3D animation techniques, and suspenseful, it’s a worthy winner.\n\nBefore the show even starts, we’re treated to an incredible stop-motion OP using unique puppeteering techniques backed by a big-band banger by ALI.  The show immediately presents the primary societal conflict which persists throughout the story: the tension between carnivores and herbivores.  It’s a wonderful piece of worldbuilding that is contrasted with characters like Louis and Legosi.  Legosi is a demure grey wolf who defers to the confrontational Louis.  Haru also bucks the stereotypical timid rabbit, as she is very confident in her sexuality.  Through them, *Beastars* builds up a divisive love versus lust storyline that is well-crafted.\n\nThe efforts by Studio Orange once again pay off, iterating on their industry-leading 3D by improving production efforts across the board.  The show uses intriguing cinematography with its split-screen conversations, fades, and camera movement that appear effortless.  It accents its clean 3D look with sequences of experimental 2D, like Haru’s dream in episode 7.  The voice actors convincingly draw viewers into the characters and give them personality.\n\nThe jury were not unanimous in our decision, but *Beastars*’ consistent high production quality and solid writing impressed many of us, and so it is our choice for Best Drama of 2019.",

The relative dearth of dedicated romance shows in 2019, combined with the overlap this genre shares with the Comedy and Drama categories resulted in a small, but no less divisive set of shows to evaluate.\n\nThe jury was generally pleased with the public nominations that reflected some of their own top choices, but this generated considerable controversy about which additional shows, if any, to nominate. The common sentiment among the jury was that the category lacked not depth, but breadth – most jurors having at least one show they held in very high regard as well as firm convictions about which shows they found wanting. However, there was very little agreement about which shows these were, leading to very spirited discussions.\n\nThe final ranking of the shows reflects the general consensus the jury arrived on at the end of their discussion – there was broad but not unanimous agreement about the placement of the top and bottom shows, while the entries that received middling rankings reflect the jury’s mixed feelings about their quality. Though it failed to perfectly please everyone, the jury is in agreement that the final ranking accurately reflects the content of their long but fruitful deliberations, and represents an excellent list of recommendations for romance anime from the past year. So long, and thanks for all the hentai~",

          "writeup": "*Manaria Friends* is at its best when it uses ambiance and environment to tell its story. The quiet atmosphere of its loosely connected, vignette-based style of storytelling is powerful at times but leads to inconsistency in episode quality as some shorts are noticeably weaker than others. This is most apparent towards the end of its run when the series tries to tell a melodramatic story in a more serialized format. The series struggles greatly during this jarring departure from form. Apart from this arc, *Manaria Friends* generally makes excellent use of visual storytelling and subtext, forgoing unnecessary exposition.\n\nThe show's highest points are, without a doubt, episodes four and six,  the \"piano\" and \"beach\" episodes. The piano episode stands out for its melancholic tone and soundtrack, while the beach episode showcases beautiful background art and reverses the roles that Anne and Grea typically play. The series's strength is undeniably the superb background art and animation. Especially for a slice-of-life short based on a mobile game, the visuals in this production are gorgeous and the slow pace allows for plenty of time to absorb the stunning environments the show inhabits. Sixth place out of all the romance shows in 2019 is no mean feat, and *Manaria Friends* deserves to be recognized among the best.",

The jury praised the overall atmosphere of the show and how sweet it was. They also felt that the half-length runtime worked well for a 4-koma adaptation, ensuring the show never overstayed its welcome. The jury also had praise for its cast, particularly the sweet main girl Nanako and bubbly artist Kino. However, some members felt that Eiji was a bit of a weaker character.\n\nAnother issue with the show was how the romance between Nanako and Eiji never came to fruition. In spite of this, some praised how clear their connection was from the start of the show. The main problem the jury had was with the ecchiness of the show, noting how it’s the polar opposite of the show’s general message and how it had no reason to be there.\n\nOverall, while the show nails what it was going for, you don’t really get anything more than you were expecting. Which is why the show ultimately fails to reach the heights of the higher ranked shows in the category. That being said, it is still a great show and definitely worthy of its ranking as one of the best romance shows of 2019. ",

          "writeup": "“A dumpster fire”, “Like watching a car wreck in slow motion”, “This is trash, but so am I”.  These are just some of the things that have been said about *Domestic na Kanojo*.   However, beneath the questionable premise was an incredibly compelling show with fully realized characters, complex dynamics explored with a surprising tact, and a story that always kept you on your toes, waiting to see what would happen next.\n\nBy not focusing so much on justifying the situations that these characters constantly find themselves in, more time was given to see how these characters would react to these situations.  While the circumstances are absurd, the characters are forced to make decisions that have real consequences, and each character is given the level of characterization where their decisions make sense. The production was a little rough around the edges, but the jury recognized the occasional moments of storyboarding brilliance and praised the overall character design.  \n\nWhile the show had a shocking amount of things going for it, it was not without its faults.  Natsuo’s portrayal as powerless was certainly an interesting angle for a self-insert mc, but it did make him feel a bit weak in comparison.  Momo’s self-contained arc was a highlight for many, but other side characters didn’t really get enough time to shine.  Ultimately, the premise and coincidences may be too much of a hurdle to overcome for some.  But as far as “trashy soap opera melodramas” go, it truly stands alone.",

          "writeup": "*High Score Girl* returned to the awards, but the split between its two parts made it somewhat awkward to judge. The three Extra Stage episodes focusing on Hidaka were almost universally liked, and showcased both the show and characters' love for fighting games off in the best way it could. However, these episodes only comprised a quarter of what the jury judged, and the second season itself was not as beloved by all jurors.\n\nWhile Haruo undergoes appropriate growth and development, Oono is sidelined and robbed of more of her already limited agency as a character. This is a realistic development as well as thematically fitting, but it forced *High Score Girl* to rely almost entirely on Haruo to drive the plot forward. It ends up somewhat hurting a show that at its core is about his relationship with Oono, rather than just his love for fighting games. \n\nThat is not to say the jury as a whole did not like the show, as the creator's passion for the arcade remains boundless and its supporting cast is perhaps even stronger than in the first season. *High Score Girl* still wears its heart on its sleeve, and its strengths are obvious, compared to the first season it fails to step up its game and as such ended up in the middle of the pack in the romance category.",

This season took a turn to more flirty teasing, better displaying a growth in the relationship between the main duo, and allowing itself to naturally progress in a charming way towards its end goal. \n\nThere were a handful of places where Takagi faltered, and ultimately kept it from placing higher in the jury rankings. Some found it to have slowly paced progress which did not advance fast enough to be significant to them. Also, some found the show’s reliance on its formula repetitious. While there was subtle nuance between skits that provided a varied and entertaining experience, the show did not tend to create too much variance in the most basic structural elements of its skits. In addition, there was division on Nishikata as a character. Some found his drive to succeed and his subtle characterization and subconscious development endearing. Others found his lack of conscious development for most of the series to be infuriating, especially as the teasing became more forwardly flirtatious from Takagi. Overall, *Takagi’s* fun antics hoisted this show into 7th place, only lower due to this common division.",

At the start of the show, Fuutaro is shown to be poor, which gives motivation for his actions, and a reason to stick with the rest of the cast. Each of the girls are also given proper attention and backstory and a reasonable chance at being Fuutaro’s ultimate love interest. Unfortunately we felt that Fuutaro was an unlikeable character for most of the season, and didn’t really earn the affection of the quintuplets.\n\nWe also disliked the visuals of the show. Although the designs of the girls were reasonably attractive and distinctive, they were often poorly drawn and animated. The exception to this was in episode 11, animated by SHAFT, which had considerably higher production values, and received higher praise from the jury.\n\nThe jury felt that the plot didn’t make much meaningful progress. Although it hit on a lot of plot points, like the fireworks and the ski trip, we thought that the first season didn’t cover enough ground, in comparison to other similar shows in the category, like *Domestic na Kanojo*, or *Given*.\n\nOverall, we felt that *5-Toubun no Hanayome* was a fun romcom, but was one that had a few critical flaws. For this reason, it received 8th place from the jury.",

Despite how progressive most modern societies appear to be regarding LGBT, the fear of being stigmatized is a present anxiety and concern many in the gay community live with. *Given* excels in exploring the many phases of discovery in romantic encounters - especially with that of a teenager discovering their sexuality. This anime communicates the grounded realities of a push and pull romance while delivering a tight and engaging story throughout, all building up to a satisfying resolution with plenty of room for the story to grow afterwards.\n\nThe consensus was that *Given* was a moving and refreshing show; due in part to the organic mix of genuine human moments into the narrative. There was some concern that the series falls back on standard romantic clichés, and at times the circumstances of the leads can push at the viewers' suspension of disbelief. Nonetheless, it remains a simple yet compelling love story. *Given* is a fine show that accomplishes what it needs to and doesn't overstay its welcome, and a fine runner up for best romance of 2019.",

This anime absolutely delivers on that ambition with success scant few of its peers can claim to achieve.\n\nIn exploring the many confusions of youth through the lens of an all-girls literature club, *Araburu* weaves together its characters’ awkward high school life stories with grace, style, and positivity. It explores nuances of sexuality with a beautiful combination of hard-hitting drama and light-hearted comedy. The themes the show tries to convey come across crystal clear, truly appealing to the emotions and experiences of the viewer. *Araburu*’s direction and overall production, too, leave little to be desired.\n\nThe decision to place *Araburu* as #1 in the category was not unanimous, however. Like all shows in the Romance category this year, there were several highly divisive aspects to the anime. The jury had mixed reception to the resolution of some of the characters’ arcs, while others took issue in the light that certain elements of the leads’ relationships were portrayed in. Another common qualm was the over-the-top nature of the cast. Other jurors found the last arc questionably paced with an ambiguous ending. Barring those few complaints, the anime was widely praised for what it did right. The jury felt that *Araburu* was the best show in the category, and deserved its first place.",

Out of these, *Non Non Biyori: Vacation* was the hands down winner from the beginning. It received high praise when it came to the development of Natsumi and Aoi, as well as the fun and novel environment it presented.\n\nWhere the rest of the nominees should place, however, was murkier. Each nominee had a substantial amount of jurors who were high on it from the start, with a very limited amount of detractors. Coupled with this, *Endro* dropped to the category later on and was received with open arms. The jury spent a good amount of time trying to find common ground and attempting to compare shows with wildly different premises, tones, and ambitions. Even some of the lower ranked entries such as *Senko-san* and *Miru Tights* still were received quite well among some jurors and got a fair amount of attention. Focus was placed on deciding whether or not a show should place higher because it had more ambition but poorer execution, versus a show that delivered simplicity competently. In addition, there was also lively conversation about legacy, and how much of an impact strong previous iterations of a show should be accounted for. There were a number of entries that built upon previously aired shows, so the jury had the task of finding the delicate balance of a show being good standalone compared to riding the coattails of its predecessor.\n\nOverall, Slice of Life should have a show for everyone to check out, whether you're looking to laugh out loud, are in the mood to have something tug at your heartstrings, or simply just want to relax after a long day.",

To celebrate, the series came back in style with a commemorative anniversary OVA containing all the strengths and weaknesses of the franchise.\n\nThe episode was funny, showing sparks of creativity in both setup and delivery in its humor. One joke in particular had jurors grinning from ear to ear as it kept escalating and escalating. Sadly, the OVA continued to retread tired punchlines. Some old gags that grew stale with repetition in the original series continue to persist here, such as Chinatsu's cooking and Sakurako insulting Himawari's boobs.\n\nTo support the comedy, jokes were accompanied by stellar character animation. Punchlines were delivered with insanely charismatic character animation, ranging from subtle body movements to showy bombastic outbursts.\n\nDespite being a competent take on the original show's formula, it ultimately lacks ambition. The OVA is content to be a simple celebratory half-hour party, putting it behind works that have more depth in theme and characterization.\n\nEven so, *Yuru Yuri、* manages to keep a spot in our nominations for its strong comedy and production value.\n",

          "writeup": "The colorful and bright world of *Endro* delighted many of the Slice of Life jurors this year, with many appreciating its vibrant world, delightful comedy, and entertaining cast. While not all jurors were able to find common ground in these aspects, many found that the approach to exploring the everyday life of a hero without the quest laid out before them was excellently executed. *Endro* goes for a poppy art style which, while some found it a bit too moe, gave its world a soft, playful feel that allows for both the comedy to land well as well as the more laid back episodes to warm the heart, but doesn’t diminish the more tense moments when they present themselves. The comedy was seen as hit or miss to a few jurors at times, but on the whole was praised. The show also boasts some fantastic character chemistry. Most jurors expressed that many of the main characters felt one-note, a flaw which likely kept it out of the top spot for the category. One exception to this was Mao, who was considered exceptional, and the rest of the cast’s personalities and how they bounced off of each other gave the cast strength through friendship even in the face of their individual weaknesses. This rather common theme of friendship is also one which is explored in an interesting way by the series, resulting in an overall cohesion which left the jury smitten with the charm this show presented.\n",

The new characters present ranged from serviceable to compelling, but the main focus was on the gripping tale of the memory altering youkai. His inability to bond with others is touching on its own, but it hits even harder knowing that Natsume has struggled with that same issue in the past. The mystery surrounding the main plot was engrossing, and many felt that the movie boasted some really solid production values. That said, we were in agreement that the movie was far too long, and parts of the movie that did not serve to add anything to the main plot. We were mixed on the parts where the movie intentionally deviates from the main arc and focuses on Natsume’s childhood friend, as many of us thought it was alright but weren’t fond of the fact that it veered off course. We felt especially mixed on the Nyanko segments, since we disagreed on whether they were funny or actively detracting from the meat of the movie.\n\nUltimately, most of us felt like a lot of the movie hits the right emotional beats, which is why it comfortably lands in the top four.\n",

It’s not attempting to tell a tight narrative or depict the drama of interwoven characters, but *Miru Tights* manages to succeed at a singular ambition – the depiction of its female characters in tights. Grounded in a surprisingly strong visual style, the show is bursting at the seams with well-crafted imagery of tights. However, the show’s visuals are the only thing that it has going for it, and beyond them, the show doesn’t really have a leg to stand on. The show has a variety of situations built on the fabric of showing off tights, but the characters fail to connect to the audience as well as some of the other shows in this category due the show’s extremely short runtime -- and their designs, while solid, fail to take advantage of the show’s visuals. Still, the show manages to present fanservice clothed with an aesthetic significantly higher in quality than most similar shows – not a small accomplishment, to be sure. All in all, the show wears its ambitions openly, and while it succeeds at its goals, it still doesn’t accomplish quite as much as many of the series on this list, landing it at a solid seventh place.\n",

From the very first days of the awards, *Non Non Biyori Vacation* was the frontrunner for most of the jury and ended up, almost unanimously, getting chosen as this year's winner. The jury, more than anything, praised the film's fantastic portrayal of the excitement going on vacation might give you. Natsumi's phenomenal arc and her relationship with Aoi, which manages to be thematically rich, relatable and moving all at the same time, was another aspect of the film the jury praised. Our cast of characters is just as strong as ever, with dynamic between them getting utilized in the best way possible. Beyond that, *Non Non Biyori Vacation* manages to capture everything that makes *Non Non Biyori* such a fascinating series and puts a spin on it that still makes it feel fresh and new. The impeccable atmosphere and hilarious comedy of it, set in a completely new environment, creates an opportunity for a lot of new comedy skits and peaceful moments. *Non Non Biyori Vacation* was an easy pick for the best slice of life anime of 2019 for most of the jury and, despite the rest of our nominations being very solid and fun anime all around, absolutely outclassed everything this category had to offer.\n",

          "writeup": "*Sewayaki Kitsune no Senko-san* is an interesting twist on the iyashikei style of anime. While most of these anime tend to be focused on healing and relaxation through comfy events and relatable pleasant experiences, *Senko-san* tackles the subject matter head on by having a protagonist worn out from work and giving him a fox girl who treats to his weariness and provides him with food, fun, and sweet relaxation. It's quite upfront with what it is — it’s quite pandery, but it works well. The art style and animation through the show is quite strong, and Dogo Kobo does a good job showcasing the relaxation of the characters with a nice, comfy atmosphere. Added to this, Senko-san is absolutely adorable, which makes it easy for the viewer to put themselves into the perspective of the main character and enjoy the wish-fulfillment that this show is.\nHowever, the very nature of this show becomes a base breaker for that reason. Some people enjoyed the pandering and the upfront way it deals with healing. Others were put off by it and didn’t like how pandery it was. Some felt that it clashed with the iyashikei tone and weakened it. Other common issues were the lack of innovative ideas, and that the show was not very good when it went outside of its comfort zone. So while *Senko-san* provided some good enjoyment and a unique way of healing it ultimately fell at the bottom of our rankings, which given the strong category of slice of life is still a pretty good showing. \n",

The show deals with Subaru’s emotional baggage after being isolated from the world after the death of his parents and watching him grow and develop with the help of his cat Haru was very enjoyable. The show’s colorful cast of characters all work well together and help reinforce themes of family.\nThe real driving force of this show is the relationship between Subaru and Haru, and the show’s depiction of their different perspectives is always a treat. The jury loved Haru’s characterization, and how she was given the same level of respect as other character characters on this show. The staff at Studio G did an excellent job at adapting the source material, presenting well done visuals and good voice acting. The original soundtrack is top notch and helps complement the warm and comfy atmosphere of the show. In addition, the show is accompanied with a banger of an opening sequence.\nFundamentally, this is a love letter to pet owners, featuring a beyond wholesome story with plenty of laughs. With its feel-good themes and uplifting story, this show definitely deserves its strong second-place finish.\n",

          "writeup": "*Honzuki* dares to take the isekai format and run in such a different direction with it that it seems almost unrelated. Our protagonist in Myne is a far cry from a hot-headed or overpowered teen boy, and the show tells us at its inception that her goal is to create books. This foundation provides a base appeal, and the story paces itself very well in relation to it, taking enough time to feel comfortable while progressing the plot steadily.\n\nThe focus is on Myne, and while other characters provide some flavor, her passion and conflicts are central to the show’s appeal. While she does develop slightly, with family being a consistently positive if somewhat understated theme, her love for books and reading are central and her triumphs and set-backs almost entirely based on this singular driving force. She is fun to watch and as upbeat as the rest of the show, but can feel static and one-note at times, and her book-loving nature seems to have no underlying reason or further purpose, which can be confusing. The shows’ drama can therefore be categorized as mostly conflicts threatening to keep Myne from her goal, which can make her character relationships feel shallow. As for the most noticeably negative aspect, the show’s production is weak, and while cute or expository moments animated in chibi form are enjoyable, they also highlight how lackluster the rest of the show looks. *Honzuki* mostly stands out for its unconventional spin on the subgenre and for its main character, and this select appeal lands the show squarely in the middle of the rankings.\n",

The public nominees were just that good.\n\nWith a movie no one had watched before the awards and some of the biggest anime franchises on the planet, Thriller/Mystery was a fiercely competitive category. *Attack on Titan* delivered on just about every promise and expectation that the series had built up over the past several years, and *Zoku Owarimonogatari* brought the *Monogatari* series to well deserved and finite conclusion. *Heaven’s Feel II* was an action-packed and horrifying continuation of the *Fate/stay night* canon, and *Penguin Highway* blew everyone away with a compelling and emotionally resonant narrative, not to mention pleasant visuals. *The Promised Neverland* made a name for itself right from episode 1 to be the shounen to keep on eye on in the years to come, carried in part by shocking twists and heart-pounding tension.\n\nDiscussions ended up being more passionate than we could have ever expected. Every juror wanted to push each nominee to the top spot, and we all had something to back up our opinions and force others to reconsider their own. But don’t think we were hostile! Our debates just made us love these nominees even more. The edge of your seat eagerness to find out what’s coming next is what makes us love thrillers and mysteries.

The animation was very fluid and the cinematography was outstanding, especially during the final act.\n\nThe movie's cast also received its fair share of praise. Many jurors liked Aoyama as a protagonist, his egotistical personality made it so he was a fun character to watch. His interactions with Onee-san were complimented, some found them to be one of the main reasons the movie never felt boring. Other characters such as Hamamoto were also well received by the jury. Despite all these positive aspects, the show did receive some criticism when it comes to the plot. The explanation given to some mysteries was seen as lacking by some jurors. Others felt that the movie was a little forgettable outside of the final act.\n\nOverall, the jury came to the conclusion that *Penguin Highway* is a very solid movie. The characters and production made it a treat to watch. However, there are some problems that prevent the series from being better, making it a good second place choice.\n",

Shiro desperately clings to his ideals to the point that he no longer could distinguish between right and wrong. And most of them all - Sakura’s slow descent into madness. Everyone is in lowest point of their lives and there is no easy decisions to make.\n\n*Lost Butterfly* impressed us with Ufotable's quality animation and Yuki Kaijura's impeccable score, delivering both during its bombastic fights and genuine character moments. It also had stellar directing, portraying conflicting feelings of its characters through visual metaphors like constantly ticking clocks, flying butterflies and masterfully crafted dream sequences, building up a sense of constant uneasiness and dread.\n\nThe pacing of the movie could have been better, with some characters not getting enough attention and transition between some scenes being too drastic. Its reliance on pre-existing material received mixed reception with the jury, as it at times felt like a summary of events, lessing impact of certain scenes. Nonetheless, *Lost Butterfly* does a great job setting the stage for Heaven's Feel III, earning it a respectable 4th place.\n",

Jurors were quite unanimous in agreeing that SHAFT's presentation is as strong as always, with potentially the best production values for the series' TV entries to date. The lower stakes in this final chapter allowed the focus to be placed squarely on the latest mystery, which was both incredibly inventive and engaging. Nisio Isin's fantastic characters were also a highlight, and significant praise was offered for Araragi's interactions and dialogue with the rest of the cast. Nevertheless, *Zoku* 's main focus was on re-examining existing character development rather than generating its own, and for many jurors this was a disappointment. There was also significant discussion around whether the series drew too heavily on past *Monogatari* titles, as some jurors did not feel *Zoku* was enough of a departure from ground that the series had already tread on before. Though many felt this allowed it to serve as a great bonus for existing fans, there were those that were less than enthusiastic about the kind of content that *Monogatari* has become known for, and believed that simply continuing the trend was not enough to redeem it fully. Even so, the strength of its narrative and the quality of its presentation were hard to ignore, and with its satisfying conclusion and poignant message, it earns a solid third place spot in our ranking.",

It keeps the suspense up all the time, ending every episode with a new cliffhanger, making for not just an easy binge, but one that’s hard to take a break from. However, the show does have its fair share of issues too that dragged down the enjoyment for some of the members of the jury.\n\nSister Krone’s insane antics and mannerisms frequently rode the line between intimidating and comedic, sometimes becoming way too over-the-top and silly, hurting the serious tone of the show. Isabella's reception was also mixed--many jurors found her an intimidating antagonist with an enjoyable backstory; however, others thought she lacked a character for most of the show, with most of her development coming in the final episode.\n\nThe writing for the main characters was generally well-liked: Ray, Emma, and Norman are all likable and their fight against this system is fun, though the side characters aren’t developed much at all.\n\nIt can also be hard to take the show seriously sometimes during some scenes, with the child geniuses coming up with these insane plans and some of the plot points testing your suspension of disbelief. The show also has some tonal problems due to this, it’s normally serious and dramatic tone can be undercut by the silliness of these scenes. The direction and production received much criticism and praise, with most scenes, but others had some questionable decisions; the CG hallway scenes and character designs are very jarring and lessen the impact the tense scenes could have achieved.\n\nThe jury’s mixed feelings on *The Promised Neverland*’s character writing, production, and whether or not it can be taken seriously along with its flaws like Sister Krone, production issues, and tonal problems dragged it down in comparison to its competition, resulting in its placement at 5th, despite its many strengths.\n",

The climactic clash between the Scouting Regiment and the Titans came to a thrilling and gripping conclusion, and just about every mystery that has plagued the series was answered, all while a new mountain of questions was built up seemingly overnight.\n\nThere was an air of tension and unpredictability coming into *Part 2*, and jurors were very positive to how episode 1 made it clear what the stakes were. The next several episodes made good on those stakes by delivering well-earned victories and heavy sacrifices, with lots of twists and turns along the way. A more tactical focus on combat was highly praised, as was an abundance of character development for many characters, especially Levi, Armin, and Erwin.\n\nThe reveal of the basement was obviously the biggest bombshell of the year in the anime community, and that reveal floored our jury. Despite all of the hints and signs staring us in the face the entire time, all it took was the final puzzle piece to answer every question we’ve had throughout the years, and introduce even more. Sure, fighting Titans is fun and all, but it’s the shockingly absorbing and compelling story that kept us watching after all these years.\n\nThere's really no telling what could possibly happen next, and that's what makes *Attack on Titan* so good. The jury was blown away by how Isayama was able to come up with a story full of action and mystery that could subvert expectations in a satisfying and earned way. *Attack on Titan Season 3 Part 2* takes a dominant first place in Thriller/Mystery, and with the final season on the horizon, everyone is prepared to see it through to the end.",

        "blurb": "2019 brought us a vast number of fascinating characters across all genres. The jury considered many different characters, and the fact that the public nominated a lot of their strongest candidates helped them to make the nomination pool even more varied and interesting. It's also fair to say that almost all characters had a very strong shot at making top half of the list, with the exception for perhaps Mob whom, while without too many massive complaints, most of the jury agreed that he didn't quite measured up to the rest of the field. On the other side of the spectrum though we had Reigen, who ended up grabbing the hearts to some degree of basically everyone in the jury thanks to his excellent arc, great reliability and fantastic character dynamics, which ended up giving him the number one spot. But every hero needs an antagonist, and for Reigen that someone was Askeladd, whose impeccable charisma and complexity ended up mesmerizing most of the jury, in result of which he ended up getting the second spot. The jury was definitely split on Emiru Aisaki and Ruru Amour from *Hugtto! Precure*. While one half of the jury ended up praising these characters' energy, how well they worked together and the way they expanded on some of *Hugtto! Precure* 's themes, the other half took issue with poor utilization of those characters in the second half of the show and how the lack of proper screen-time of them ended up hurting both Ruru and Emiru as characters. The jury also found the story of Okko to be very moving and - despite their low rankings - Rika Sonezaki and Legoshi were still characters who ended up getting quite a bit of praise from the jury for their reliability and solid character arcs, which just speaks of how strong Main Dramatic Character category was in 2019.",

Her arc was simple and not the most unique, however its execution is what really made her stand out amongst her contemporaries. We got to see Sonezaki grow from an awkward girl with anxieties and misgivings about the opposite gender, to a girl who is open about her feelings whilst also retaining some of her quirkiness which helped create some hilarious scenes. Her journey of development - with the help of her friends - felt extremely natural and cathartic, and her relationship with Shun was super wholesome while also serving as a nice contrast to some of the messier relationships in the show.\n\n However, whilst the jury praised the execution of Sonezaki’s arc, they also felt as though she didn’t do a lot outside of her relatively small arc which ends halfway through the show. Additionally, her supporting role in the final arc wasn’t significant enough, and some jurors felt as though she seemed removed from the other characters during this period of time. If it wasn’t such a strong year for dramatic characters, Sonezaki probably would have placed higher. That said, this year had such a strong offering the jury wound up placing her 6th overall.\n",

Her story, one of adapting to new environments and overcoming tragedy was dealt with tact and sincerity. Okko learning and changing as a person through the kindness she received by those in the inn and the countryside was a pleasure to watch. The supporting cast did a great job of bringing out these developments in her, leading to some very heartfelt interactions that furthered her relatability as a character and showcased the growth she underwent since the film’s beginning. Most notably of these, Glory Suiryo and the charming big-sisterly relationship she fosters with Okko was a highlight for many of us.\n\nSome minor complaints here and there explain Okko not being able to surpass the likes of Askeladd and Reigen in ranking. In particular, some jurors felt the resolution to her grappling with the death of her parents was packed a bit too tightly into the movie’s latter half. No one felt this issue was debilitating to her character however, and her strengths earned her a plenty respectable third place in the category.\n",

Emiru stands out on a moment to moment basis due to her eccentric and bubbly personality, which is a stark contrast to her counterpart Ruru. At her core, Emiru's character arc and characterization exists opposite to that of Ruru's more deadpan affect. A dichotomy in every aspect. Despite being the more immature of the two, it is Emiru who has the emotional intelligence to teach Ruru how to live and feel. This dichotomy comes to a climax at the end of the show as the roles are reversed once again and Emiru must take on the more deadpan role in order to resolve the final conflict. Emiru is a dynamic character that evolves and changes along with Ruru. She is a beacon of relentless positivity on the cast of the show and becomes more whole because of Ruru and vise versa.\n\nThat being said, the jury felt that Emiru’s time on screen was poorly utilized during some of the filler episodes of the show, which is why she finds herself 4th in the category.\n",

Many found her arc to be compelling, and while it’s nothing unique, it's the execution that matters in this case. Emiru and the other precures regard her as a real person and treat her as such, which contradicts the treatment she’s used to. Ruru repays the favour when Emiru is at her lowest, and Ruru uses her newfound emotional intelligence to reassure her. The role reversal is poetic and emphasizes just how much they care for each other. The versatility of Ruru as a character was put to the test when the show drifted towards a more comedic tone, especially during the filler episodes. Her deadpan nature is played for laughs when paired with the more energetic Emiru and makes for an odd pairing and their interactions are funny to watch play out.\n\nThe main issue we had with Ruru though is her arc’s ending at the end of the series, and we did not feel it was satisfying in comparison to the payoff Emiru receives. Another issue was how poorly utilized her screen time was, which is why she finds herself 5th in the category.\n",

The second half of season 2 is him bearing the fruits of his character growth by acting as a catalyst for other characters' growth and development. Acting as a great example to follow, Mob inspires those around him to be a better person, and attempts to resolve issues with words instead of violence.\n\nNo one on the jury disliked Mob, and all felt that he was a decent protagonist for the show. There were two major factors that left him in last place with our jury. The first was that while no one disliked him, very few felt he did enough to lift him above the stiff competition of this category. The second is the feeling that he was becoming preachy about his ideals towards the end and thus hampered the ending conflict of the show. \n\nMob is still a great lead for a fantastic show filled with some of the best characters of the year. While he may have been outshined in his own show, he is still a shining example of how to write a compelling protagonist in an action series. \n",

Sometimes it takes hitting rock bottom before we finally realize just how fortunate we were, and what we now are without. Meet Arataka Reigen. Reigen has always been a main player in the story of *Mob Psycho 100*, but season 2 brought him to the forefront of the story. His time as series lead may only have been brief stint (only 2 episodes), but in that time, we see his meteoric rise to fame, his subsequent fall, and genuine character growth as a result.\n\nHis 2 episode character arc does an excellent job on calling Reigen's character into question getting him to genuinely re-evaluate his life, and gave him a wakeup call to how poorly he treated Mob in the past. He may still manipulate people, and he may still be an idiot at times, but at the end of the day, he is a conman with a heart of gold. His evolution throughout season 2 from an egocentric individual to someone who genuinely sees the people around him, as well as how he becomes a genuine role model for Mob from both their perspectives was a joy to see unfold. To add the icing on the cake, Reigen's sheer charisma and antics balance the character out and make him an enjoyable presence, even when the limelight isn't his.\n\nThe culmination of all these aspects is an amazing character, and for the jury, the best character in a main dramatic role in 2019\n",

A lot of this awkwardness is due to the role society tries to force him into. As a carnivore he is always being looked at with suspicion, so even as an introverted person, he tries still to come off even more as non-threatening. It was felt by the jurors that his motivations and characterization were fairly consistent and it was enjoyable watching him grow and become more accepting of himself. The real highlight of his character that many talked about were his interactions with Louis and how the playing of stereotypes, an introverted/beta carnivore and an extroverted/alpha herbivore were a really fascinating dynamic. On the other hand, some in the jury, however, did not particularly care for this or his relationship with Haru, feeling that some of the dialogue, as well as the payoff of the relationship this season, was weak. While a sequel may ultimately handle these things better, the jury felt that as things stood this season, it was a mixed bag overall.\n\nOverall, while it was felt that there was a lot to like in Legoshi, from his characterization to his story arc, there were also some negatives weighing him down. It was for these reasons we decided to place Legoshi in 7th place.\n",

With a strong, swaggering charisma, and devious, strategic mind, he is easily a nominee based on screen presence alone. However, this tough mercenary exterior is only a front, hiding the tragedy of repeating misery, war, and patricide that drives his character.\n\nThe jury felt fairly positive about Askeladd as a character. Consensus opinion was that he deftly balanced his role as an antagonist to the series lead, Thorfinn, while simultaneously starring as the underdog hero of his own story. His transformation from pirate to right hand of a future king was a compelling narrative that added strategy and political intrigue to the story of *Vinland Saga*. Motivated by a nuanced mix of pain, justice, and rage, Askeladd's conflicting emotions inform on his grey morality. He is equally capable of performing great, heroic deeds, selfish thefts, making altruistic sacrifices, and committing sadistic acts of malice: all while still being seen as a sympathetic character to the audience.\n\nLastly, his final moments of the show were both deeply cathartic, and a spectacular ending to the show; a perfect capstone to the life of a man defined by a world of war. Askeladd is well deserving of being the runner up for best main character in a dramatic role.\n",

Jurors taking a view on any given character that fell somewhere in the middle between these extremes wasn't unheard of, but it was much less common than the jury being firmly divided between opposing views on each character. The eventual top two finishers, Chika and Shamiko, were among the few nominees who the jury found more of a consensus on, but even these each had a couple of strong detractors in the jury.\n\nThe other major theme of this year's jury deliberations for the category was a handful of shows presenting multiple characters that dominated much of the discussion. *Kaguya-Sama: Love Is War*, *Non Non Biyori: Vacation* and *Hitoribocchi* each wound up having two characters represented among the finalists, while Momo from *Machikado Mazoku* narrowly missed making the group of finalists and giving that show multiple characters in the top 8 as well.\n\nIn the final vote, the two least polarizing characters among the jury, Chika and Shamiko, wound up separating themselves from the rest of the finalists, and Chika secured the top spot in a rather close vote that reflected well how the jury deliberations had played out throughout the process in the category this year.",

However, while there wasn't one definitive issue the jury had with Natsumi, several jury members had various issues with her character that resulted with her being in a lower standing than some of our other nominations. Some jurors thought that the ending of her arc left a bit to be desired, while others complained about how the dramatic and comedic aspects of her character weren't that well executed and that the change from a more lighthearted atmosphere to a serious tone was shoehorned and beyond the reasonable suspension of disbelief. But despite these problems, Natsumi left quite an impression on a lot of main comedic jurors and ended up being one of the most memorable characters in this category.  \n",

Some of us felt she was the best character in the show, some felt she was seriously underutilized, some liked how she grew or initiated growth, and others felt while she performed well in her role wish there was a little more to her character.  Nako has excellent chemistry with most of the cast and her role is so vital that the show most likely would collapse without her. Depending on who Sunao is talking to her straight man routine can vary quite differently. Routines such as dismissing Bocchi's imaginative delusions, her dismissive and bickering moments with Aru, and even the rare moments where she is surprised or embarrassed. \n\nWhile Nako was pretty much loved by most of the jurors she suffered from quite a few problems which dropped her ranking. Some of us felt that Nako was more of a supporting character rather than a main character. The core of Nako's gags is her ability to act as a straight man so if you don't find that appealing you won't like her at all. This is detrimental in Nako's case due to her having little presence in the second half of the show. Overall Nako is a  good or decent character which helped her overtake the weaker nominations. However it was made abundantly clear that while she wasn't a bad character she wasn't a strong one so her rank fell short to higher quality nominations.

However there were 2 issues that came up that could not be reconciled with the jurors which is why she was not selected in the end.\n\nMost of Renge’s interactions were funny and seemed to be insightful. Despite this, the jury found that they lacked substance without significant context from prior seasons. As a stand alone 2019 movie, Renge’s character is unfounded and poorly supported. We could not consider her strengths to be entirely developed in the context of the movie. Most of her characterization occured in 2 seasons of a show that aired outside of 2019. As such *Non Non Biyori Vacation*, as a movie could not win as we only consider it stand alone.\nThe other major flaw the jury found was that Renge did not have a lot of screen time, due to this installment of the series being a movie and not a full tv season. The first issue could have been resolved with enough screen time to justify Renge’s personality and give her more time to develop as a character and explain why she’s so important to the comedic atmosphere of the show. However, with a movie there is very limited screen time and therefore the jury determined that they did not have enough evidence to choose her over some of the other more fleshed out nominees.\n",

However, the comedy in Dr. Stone is very Senku-centric, any funny moments in the show completely revolve around him, which effectively made him the odd one out. Many of the jokes in the show might get a chuckle or 2  out of you the first time around, but after a while they get stale and fall flat. We felt that the jokes got really repetitive and the comedy, not being one of the main focuses of the show, only distracted from its other more compelling and dramatic aspects. Senku’s habit of explaining his intentions in the worst way possible while knowing how it might come across  to outsiders is certainly an interesting  trait of his  character; combine that with his sadistic persona that comes out from time to time and you get a recipe for situational hilarity.  However, after the 5th or 6th time this happened,  the audience will start getting sick of the joke and begin  wondering what was funny about it in the first place, which is something most of the jurors felt. If the anime had more variety in its humour style, different skits, or just more interaction with more comedic characters then he might’ve landed a higher place on the list, but in the end we felt this spot was 10 billion percent deserved.",

Shamiko’s not a winner-- and that’s fine.\n\nIt could easily be said that *Machikado Mazoku*, when it comes down to it, is Shamiko, and vice versa. Certainly, a large chunk of the comedy stems from Shamiko’s bumbling antics, and she is the fundamental central piece that holds the cast together. She is a lovable blend of earnest, incompetent, and hopelessly stubborn that ends up being difficult not to root for, even after she has failed for the umpteenth time.\n\nIn particular, the jury latched on to her growing relationship with her archnemesis Momo, as well as her upbeat vocal performance by Konomi Kohara, and the expressiveness of her character as shown through not just through her facial reactions but also her tail. Incredibly, her tail is as much of a tool in conveying her emotions as her actual expressions are, and it’s a very well used recurring visual gag that gets a lot of extra information across even in background scenes.\n\nThroughout the show it never gets old watching Shamiko continue her futile struggles. And seeing her gradually win over Momo more and more with her straightforward earnestness makes their relationship feel as though it’s constantly moving forward. In the end she couldn’t come out on top in this category, but even so we’ll cheer her on: “Ganbare, Shamiko!” Surely she’ll get it next time.\n",

An excellent balance of intellectual maturity and childlike-naiveté let Kaguya stand out amongst a group of such wonderful characters, with particular praise being aimed at Kaguya’s imbalanced emotions driving the story and comedy forward. Be it her inability to understand the intricacies of life or her horrifyingly brilliant and tactical way to get Shirogane to walk home with her, Kaguya was able to glue our eyes to her just about every time she was on screen. \n\nThat said, the jury couldn’t help but feel like her genius was all she had going for her until the very end. Some members of the jury noted that a few sketches relied on Kaguya monologuing her own plan (only to be interrupted by Fujiwara), violating the classic “show, don’t tell” trope. It wasn’t until the end of the season that Kaguya’s more personal emotions come out, particularly how she feels of her family and friends. Regardless, there was an acknowledgement that despite these late character developments, they are ultimately important for her and the story as a whole. Between her humor, maturity, love-struck innocence, and more, there was never any doubt that Kaguya is an excellent character. And so, Kaguya Shinomiya takes a strong third place.\n",

Chika markedly improved every scene she was in and stole the spotlight for most of them with her antics. The jury really appreciated the chaotic random decision making she brought to the show which proved to be a key ingredient in the show’s comedy. Another thing that the jury praised was her surprising intellect. Even though she originally came off as a ditz, she appears to be a lot smarter than she is portrayed as initially and at many point she is meticulously planning something behind the scenes. In the memory card game skit, the jury was pleasantly surprised to see her try to cheat her way to victory. One of Chika’s  most notable moments in the show was the volleyball training skit with Shirogane as she was portrayed as being more of a role model figure. Her mad barz in the word game battle was also comedic gold as well. Konomi Kohara’s voice acting  effectively portrayed Chika as her range of tone and expressions brought out the craziest moments of the character. Overall, *Kaguya-sama* was just a better show in general when Chika Fujiwara was on screen and the jury is proud to announce her as the top nomination in Main Comedic.",

Bocchi herself is just a pure and adorable cinnamon roll on screen, and her heartfelt struggles to open up and socialize no doubt fit with the experiences of many of us. Speaking of which, her shyness and comedic reactions to her new school life is quite resonant, aided in part from a star turning performance from the up-and-coming Chisaki Morishita. Bocchi's amusing reactions and adorableness thus help elevate her and her series from the usual Cute Girls Doing Cute Things Slice-of-Life Affair, particularly in her interesting and unique interactions with the various members of the cast.

We were impressed by how she never gave off the impression of a small adult and was acting appropriately for her age. She’s intellectually above her peers, but she’s still just a little girl who hasn’t matured enough to express her own feelings towards others. She has a crush on Aoyama and gets jealous when she sees that a bond has formed between him and the dentist lady, but, as you would expect from a little girl, in a purely selfish act she tries to sever the connection between them instead of telling Aoyama the truth about why she’s so angry at him. Hamamoto is the most prominent supporting character of the movie, but she’s largely absent in the first and third acts, and she gets sidelined in the climax of the story. Despite the lack of screen time and the missed opportunity to give Hamamoto an emotionally satisfying conclusion, she was such a well-realized, believable character that she left a lasting impression on the jury.",

Watching her grow as a person and make a real connection to the club as their mentor is fantastic, and it's clear how important she was to the strength of their performance at the final regional competition.\n\nHer dynamic with Hozuki in particular is executed well. We see how the pressure affects both of their lives, with emphasis on how worthless Akira feels in Hozuki’s shadow. We see the bond between them slowly bridge this resentment to form a mutual understanding and help provide a unique insight into both character's perspectives while steadily building Akira’s confidence. She develops a strong bond with the members of the Koto Club as they relentlessly work to improve despite their lack of natural talent. This effort reminds Akira of herself, and she develops a sincere desire to support them in their goals.  She becomes a great mentor and friend to each of them, even helping Hoozuki reunite with her mother in one of the most touching scenes of the show. \nDespite not joining the show until season two she shone bright enough to make a huge impression on the jury. The strength of her arc, her bonds with the cast, and how pivotally important she was to the season led the jury to decide she was the best candidate for the year.",

Audiences found her playful endearing for her surface-level charm, but after the story re-contextualized her kind facade viewers grew more appreciative of her dramatic appeal. Understanding the motivations behind her gimmick hint at deeper mechanisms at work in *Demon Slayer* 's character writing, teasing perhaps that similar characters also have more going on under the surface.\n\nThe totality of her character for the eligible season served mostly as a foundation where future story can build on. But, only being an active character briefly in the closing episodes meant she had limited bandwidth to leave an impression. Compared to the other nominees, Shinobu's limited involvement meant that she did not have the appropriate opportunities to establish herself as a compelling character, thus locking her in at 8th place.",

At the same time, we get to watch her own perceptions of strength get challenged and watch her wrestle through her own inadequacies. Unfortunately, this was her only dedicated arc and it’s just as much dedicated to teaching us who Tohru’s Mom was as it was exploring Uotani’s past.\n\nShe still managed to cement herself as a strong foundation for the cast, helping to lift those around her and explore different parts of their characters.

Despite presenting themselves as a violence-loving embodiment of the Viking spirit, there are far deeper layers *Vinland Saga*’s mangaka Makoto Yukimura has hidden within his characters. You might assume he is a foil of both Askeladd; who mocks that lifestyle, and Thors; who ran away from it. However, he fits far better as a foil for Thorfinn.\n\nThorfinn is heavily driven by a desire for vengeance and his view on the world is very negative and distasteful. This helps Thorkell shine, as he is everything Thorfinn hates about Vikings; needlessly killing others for fun or switching sides to participate in battles. Throughout these acts, he showcases a strong sense of integrity and honour, something Thorfinn shares regarding his duels with Askeladd. Taking Thors’ forgotten words about what makes a true warrior into account, Thorkell is surely a very poor role model for Thorfinn, but that is what makes him so great.\n\nThorkell is an expertly designed representation of Thorfinn’s potential future, the person he may turn into if he does not correct his mindset. This masterful act of planting the seeds for future development of a character is why Thorkell stood out among the jury. However, influence alone can only get you so far against others who execute that well, while also actively impacting the story. This was the deciding factor in placing Thorkell below the other top nominees in the grouping. In the end, it was not simply brute force that pulled Thorkell to the top, but the very concept of it that helped his case.",

He has continued to be a stoic, badass presence that demands attention and properly sets the mood for the scenes he's in. We get a bit of that in Season 3 Part 2 when he's forced to fight a large group of enemies alone. More importantly, he is at the center of the season's climax, being forced to make a choice that has huge and long-lasting implications. The drama that comes from this is fascinating to watch and Levi is characterized so well it is clear why he struggles with the two options he is offered. We also understand, in the end, why he makes his decision.\n\nIn the end, Levi doesn’t stand out that much this season compared to other characters. In part, he suffers from season three being split cour, Season 3 Part 1 having aired during the summer of 2018. If the two seasons had aired together, as the first season had back in 2013, Levi’s actions and character arc would have been far more impactful. It was felt that while Levi had several great moments, and a culmination of his arc from Season 3 Part 1, it just wasn’t enough in Part 2 by itself. For these reasons, he's our 7th best supporting dramatic character of the year.",

As such, many in the jury thought her role was merely to be an obstacle. Others had the opposite opinion, finding her to be a really interesting way to do exposition about the world while simultaneously telling her own story of downfall and submission.\n\nOverall, the jury was divided on Isabella. Some thought that she showcased the story’s strengths, and others thought she was emblematic of its problems. Most notably, many jurors thought her backstory was inserted at the wrong time and received insufficient foreshadowing, and some found her overall presence to be lacking, especially as the story went on. However, she was still a crucial part in creating the show’s tense atmosphere and showing just how cruel its world is, earning her a place among this year’s best characters.",

Despite his overall significance in the show, Erwin's presence and impact on events in this particular portion of the series fails to measure up to some of the stronger nominees. Devoting a large segment of the season's runtime to exposition naturally means limiting the time for character moments, and Erwin does not escape this inevitability.\n\nInspiring his soldiers to follow him into danger has always been a cornerstone of Erwin's character and this season is no exception. He implores them to join the most dangerous maneuver upon which the Survey Corps has ever embarked, fully prepared to lay down his own life and the lives of his soldiers in pursuit of the future for which he yearns. His conversation with Levi exerts a huge influence on what many would say is the most emotionally charged moment of this season. Despite the significance of these moments, his appearances are too infrequent for the jury to put him in the top half of the nominees, but this is due more to the nature of the season itself than any particular flaw with Erwin. Every time Erwin is on screen, his stoic presence dominates the scene in such a manner that his gravitas weighs on the rest of the cast. It would not be a stretch to say that Erwin is the strongest character outside of *Shingeki no Kyoujin*’s core trio.",

Machio did not go down without a fight however, finishing with a strong second, with Dimple from *Mob Psycho 100 II* at III. In a hilariously fitting result given that she's the ancestor of Shamiko, Lilith managed to demonstrate exactly why Four is Death with her final rank, followed closely afterwards by Yamai from *Joshikousei no Mudazukai* demonstrating that angels DO in fact fall to demons, or at least Doom Blade. It wasn't quite a Hollywood ending for *Non Non Biyori Vacation* 's Aoi Nizato, who finished sixth, with Hanako from *Kemono Michi* 's getting her just deserts at seventh. Finally, last on the list was *Joshikousei no Mudazukai* 's Loli, who got the short end of the stick from the condorcet poll.

A lot of that time is used to portray her eating habits and general gluttony as a half-dragon, but the show leans a bit too much on that particular joke. The jurors have seen this kind of thing before, and *Kemono Michi* does not take a particularly innovative approach with it. As such, her appearance on screen is occasionally rendered predictable and more of a sideshow to whatever happens to be going on. Hanako will be eating something on the sidelines regardless.\n\nBut there is a lot more to Hanako than just her appetite. Occasionally it's shown that she is aware of her position and power, but intentionally chooses not to engage with it. She outright refuses to give herself any more importance than she wants to have, and her position as a supporting character in the show is one of her own choice. During the sixth episode, when she is forced to take an active role, Hanako is almost an entirely different and far more serious character, without losing her comedic approach. This shows that there's definitely an interesting character hidden behind the gluttony, but the show did not always manage to show Hanako properly.",

Her brief friendship with Natsumi is the primary focus of the film, and she has an excellent dynamic with Natsumi as she tries to balance her role as a hostess with her excitement at meeting someone her age that she gets along with. Her diligence combined with her infectious positivity makes for arguably some of the strongest moments in the movie, such as the moment of excitement when she gets permission to help tour the island for the girls, or when she shows them the bioluminescent algae at night. She is also a focal point for Natsumi’s arc, as she provides a very real depiction of a short-term friendship that is nonetheless quite fleshed out. The authenticity she adds to the film is crucial for Natsumi to confront her desire to stay and the need for her to go.\n\nHowever, ultimately, the jury decided that since she is playing a fairly simple foil and does not have much of a compelling arc of her own or anything more substantial outside of that role, she could not hold up to the comedic stylings of some of the other characters in the category. She is an important component of the film and was worth nominating in that regard, but the relatively limited role she plays kept her from climbing higher in the ranking.",

          "writeup": "Saku, better known by her nickname, “Loli”, is much like her name implies, a very cute, short, childish high schooler. While not the most original type of character in the world, Saku stands as a great example of the trope done well. \n\nEverything Loli does is adorable and really easy to like. One specific example that the jury was a big fan was her affection towards her grandmother, which is really sweet, and also hilariously ironic because of her age. The childlike naivete of hers is really endearing but also sets her up as a fitting target for comedic bullying from everyone in the cast, letting characters like Baka trick her into doing stupid things because she doesn’t know any better. Her earnest desire to want to grow up and make friends is also endearing. Not to mention the payoff when she actually does start making friends after all her effort to do so, which is really satisfying as well.\n\nHowever, despite her cute nature and positive charms, Saku doesn't have quite the same depth or creativity as some of the other candidates. There have been many characters like this in the past, but Saku really does shine within her archetype. With a very strong year and an extremely close race for every placement on the rankings, these flaws were enough to hold her back, despite her many upsides.",

Lilith's shameless nature suits a succubus and she is the embodiment of who Shamiko is supposed to be if Shamiko wasn’t at heart a magical girl despite being of the demon race. The jury also agreed her antics with the dream manipulation, her interactions with Momo, and the hilarious figurine body she got in one scene really added value to the overall atmosphere of the show.\n\nThat being said Lilith had a really uphill battle in this category as a significant portion of the  jury did not find enough evidence to support the position that Lilith had serious growth, development, or overall change as a character throughout the show. A considerable amount of her characterization was static and she was comedic relief for most of the show.\n\nOverall without a notably meaningful backstory, and only moderate levels of relevance to the plot after a certain point, she fails to pass the standards required of a best supporting character category winner. Although she falls short of  being good enough to win, she still won over several members of  the jury and is definitely in the upper end of supporting comedic characters presented in 2019.",

Generally, Yamamoto's skits were some of the standouts of the show.  She brightened up every scene she was in whether it be her attempt to rap her way out of trouble, hopping from tree to tree, or challenging people to delusional magic duels. Her easy flowing character interactions and seamless integration into any given skit within the show received high praise. Also noted was how phenomenal her personal character focused episode was and the insight it provided into the method behind her madness.\nUnfortunately, it was accepted that Yamamoto was less developed as a character than some of the other nominees. Her impact in regards to the comedic parts of the show was greatly appreciated, but she is lacking in terms of actual meaningful characterization, while some of the other characters were able to achieve both.\n\nOverall, the jury thought Minami Yamamoto was a fun, lively character that helped elevate *Joshikousei no Mudazukai*, but was too shallow to be the overall winner.",

Machio accomplishes this feat with an undying love for muscles, a natural talent to teach, and a hulking physique that is itself the punchline to many jokes. Machio was designed to be  impactful  and and take the spotlight in every scene he is in, yet he was intentionally kept one dimensional to avoid overshadowing the development of the girls who are front and center. The gimmick of having a trainer be a mentor to both the characters in the show as well as the viewers following along works effectively towards achieving the  dual goals of *Dumbbells* as both a SoL and an educational anime.\nHowever, the one sidedness can be a double edged sword. For the amount of screentime he is given, Machio shows little to no development especially compared to other characters  in this category. Furthermore his brand of humor commits to one specific style which did not always resonate  with many of the jurors.\n\nOverall a powerful contender in the supporting comedic category, Machio dominated discussion from the first day of deliberating. While criticisms remain, it is hard to ignore that his unparalleled presence, and overall well received humor qualify him as among the best of 2019. SAIDO CHESTO!",

Mob is tasked with exorcising a family of spirits and he isn't sure of himself with the job at hand.

He is a voice of reason and knowledge to not only Mob, but Reigen and othersin crucial moments as well as being a welcome comic relief character when things are getting a little too tense. His ability to diffuse almost every serious scene contributes strongly to color Mob Psycho’s unique style as not an ordinary shonen story. Dimple is the epitome of a supporting comedic character, a well thought-out character that doesn’t steal the spotlight from the main cast, but is there when needed. While a couple others impressed more, the jury ranks him highly as among the best of the year.",

Her ruthlessly deadpan attitude pushed through the backdrop of the fake personality she sometimes uses to hide it, making for some delightful gap moe. The trademark uninterested voice that she has while casually causing mayhem for others also won high praise from most of the jurors. \nAs with any supporting character her screentime is limited, but she is able to use it effectively. Most of her actions are dedicated to help Kaguya achieve her goals, becoming an older sister like figure, and her grounded thought process is a good contrast to Kaguya's goofy personality, keeping the show's comedic style fresh and unpredictable. We felt this status was important in cementing her as a supporting yet meaningful character. She truly has the charisma and popularity to become a leading character herself, but the show delicately manages her appearances to make sure she stands  out without stealing the spotlight. \n\nComing in with massive popularity, she was always going to be a front runner. Yet the jury was split debating her qualifications compared to the more quotable and outlandish Machio. In the end we preferred the multifasceted humor and proper support Ai was able to give and award her as the best of 2019. Justice for Hayasaka, Season 2 can't come soon enough.",

There were plenty of compelling antagonists this year, but we felt that these two clearly stood above the rest in terms of development and impact. Quickly though, we concluded Askeladd’s sheer presence over the entire story of Vinland secured him as the top spot for our list. Similarly, due to their lack of development and screen time, Zeke was unanimously left at the bottom of the list, as we agree that while he has potential to become a great villain, he is not there yet.\n\nWith the top and bottom of the list decided, the jury spent the rest of its time deciding the placement of the rest of the candidates. Arguments were made for the over-the-top charismatic villains like Doppio and Thorkell, the cunning foes in the background such as Akito and Muzan, or the one with a short yet impactful appearance with Mogami. Debates spanned weeks, until the order was finally decided upon. Still, for us to come to a conclusion on the winner so fast shows how much of an impact Askeladd had as an antagonist that will be remembered for years to come.",

Thorkell has surprising depth for a character who is introduced as a brutal warrior who seeks battle above all else. He is a charismatic leader who inspires courage in his soldiers. His threat is real enough that even Askeladd’s troops run from him. His size, appetite, and presence also make him a great source of comic relief.\n\nThroughout the season, Thorfinn’s stubbornness and thirst for vengeance manifests itself in his misplaced lust for battle. Thorkell is the first insurmountable obstacle he encounters, and his excitement to have found a worthy opponent is clear. Thorkell respects strength above all else, and takes a greater interest in Thorfinn when he learns of his connection to Thors. He seeks to understand what made Thors the ideal Viking, and learns from Thorfinn. Thorfinn himself is too blinded to reflect on the lessons his father taught him, but Thorkell’s introspection shows his personal growth and makes him an excellent foil to Thorfinn.\n\nThough Thorkell transcends his Viking persona, we don’t get the same kind of deep moral characterization that we do for the top nominees. The jurors were looking for some exploration of his more serious traits. Despite standing over seven feet tall, Thorkell remains in the shadow of Askeladd and Isabella. Nevertheless, his character is a joy to watch, and fun as hell. The jury immensely enjoyed this paragon of a viking, and placed him solidly in third.",

A common rot found almost universally in all societies is that of the parent or spouse physically or emotionally harming those they are obligated to protect. And wielding such overwhelming influence over the family, Akito Soma’s abuse is precision-focused to disrupt and destroy the main characters of *Fruits Basket* in every sense. As the antagonist of a shoujo story about family and recovery, he serves as the perfect villain of this story as a living embodiment of toxicity.\n\nThe jury was reasonably split on Akito. While some found the slow-burn terror of his presence compelling, others believed he was too inactive to have significant relevance to the story - his part in the story only truly beginning as the first season of *Fruits Basket* wrapped up. However, being introduced early on as the lead antagonist of a long running series also means there is room for him to develop as a character as his story is not quite complete. As it stands, Akito has great potential as a returning antagonist in the second season, but for now he has to settle with a respectable fourth place finish for Best Antagonist.",

Instead of trying to overpower Mob in a fight, Mogami traps him in a nightmarish world while he lurks in the background as our narrator, showing us a world that “could have been”.\n\nThe jury generally agreed on how Mogami was the best antagonist of *Mob Psycho 100 II*. For a series known for epic psychic battles, Mogami presents a new kind of challenge for Mob, and his story arc is an interesting spin on the series’ formula. He served as a great roadblock for Mob to grow as a character, and we liked Mogami as a concept, but many of us had issues with his lack of screen time, proper development, and compelling motivations. He leaves a lasting impression on the viewers, but he didn’t become a fully realized character, which puts him at the bottom half of our nominations.",

During the battle, he uses his size and strength to hurl giant rocks at the scouts from a safe distance, leaving seemingly no chance for a counter-attack. Witnessing him leisurely murder dozens of soldiers with each throw served as a great buildup for when he gets taken down by Levi, in a very literal expression of “the bigger they are, harder they fall” idiom, and one of the most striking moments of the season.\n\nHowever, the jury almost unanimously placed him last. The main reason being that, compared to his peers, Zeke is a rather underdeveloped and shallow character. While we see glimpses of his personality in inner monologues, conversations, and also in the origins’ flashback, in the end his motivations remain largely unknown, and his characteristics superficial. It seemed like we were still being teased by the show about his role in the future events, rather than really getting to know him. Leaving a weak impression is generally a bad sign in a character reward, and without having much to hang on to besides potential, the Beast Titan had no choice but to fall to the bottom of our rankings.",

Instead, it was his effect on the leads Tanjiro and Nezuko, his own subordinates, and those around him at large. Not once in the season do we see Muzan actually fight, in spite of his demonstrated strength. Yet his effects are found in every major villain along the way in how he effectively gaslights them. Coming to them with soft, kind words. Convincing them to join him in their darkest hour, only to string them along with promises of his blood. Like a drug dealer giving free samples to keep customers coming back, abusing them while caring nothing for their lives. All the while, Toshihiko Seki does a fantastic job of lacing his silky smooth tones with just the right amount of malice to sell every scene he is in. \n\nUltimately however, Muzan's role in this season is limited compared to others of the year. Only truly appearing in person twice, the rest of the time in flashbacks during other characters arcs. Rarely being the focus of the show, making this first season largely a setup for his full involvement later on. As such, the jury could not rightfully place a character with such limited interaction, however great his promise, above characters who dominated across the entire runtime of their series.",

Diavolo is shown to have an unhealthy obsession with hiding his tracks, stopping at nothing to eliminate anyone who dares to unearth his mysterious past. His extreme paranoia manifests into his alter-ego Doppio, a feeble but unstable man with a tendency for frequent volatile outbursts. It is this obsession that leads Diavolo down the path of attempting to find his daughter Trish in an effort to slaughter her with his own hands, and subsequently his long-winded clash with our main protagonists.\n\nAlthough Diavolo certainly had his moments of spectacle, the general consensus of the jury was that he was the embodiment of an interesting concept with a subpar execution. With the extent that the show went to portray Diavolo as a genuine source of threat and intimidation, Diavolo lacked presence - a byproduct of spending nearly 30 episodes off-screen, which significantly diminished any semblance of impact or fear that he has seemingly imbued into the characters. Coupled with the deficit of meaningful interactions with the protagonists and the lackluster finale, where his spotlight is immediately taken away by the Requiem Stands as he subsequently meets his ignominious demise to face possibly one of the worst fates in anime history, it completes the recipe for the ultimate wasted potential.",

There was barely any debate for Isabella compared to others as she was pretty much universally loved by all the jurors for a variety of reasons. From her warped form of love being the result of the twisted system she grew up in, to how she was the heroine protagonist who couldn't believe in herself or her family. All of those resulted in her predicament, yet this same outcome allows her to efficiently watch over the children. Isabella - through experience and training - is effectively able to predict most of the children's plans and effortlessly crush them in a variety of manners, ranging from verbal interrogations, body language cues or signs, and rarely even physical suppression. Isabella isn't a one-trick pony nor is she one-dimensional, she is a tragic victim of the system.\n\nIsabella, while excellent, isn’t perfect and had a couple of moments where the jurors split hairs on. While her backstory is superb, it is told almost entirely in the last episode and some jurors didn't enjoy how it was handled. Indeed, while Isabella and Askeladd are quite similar in many ways due to tragic worlds, cunning, and warped forms of love, Askeladd's background is slowly revealed throughout the story which lead to a spectacular conclusion of his character. The same couldn't be said for Isabella though, and this contrast earned her an impressive second place among the nominations, just short of first.",

A man who has committed patricide multiple times throughout the narrative, and yet at the same time takes up the mantle of a father figure, imparting knowledge and wisdom for the leads to develop.

We started our journey quite roughly, and whether or not a show was a \"must-watch\" was hotly contested—mainly focusing on character chemistry, strong antagonist motivation, and overall presence and growth. One notable case was *Battleship Yamato 2202*, as it had tremendous support from one juror in particular, and they ultimately succeeded in changing enough minds for it to be included.\n\nAfter tens, if not hundreds, of hours of decision-making, dramatic write-ups, nitpicking and critiquing; *Run with the Wind* was chosen by the jury. Although all 8 nominees, both jury and public, were excellent, we believe that *Run with the Wind* encapsulates a truly outstanding and remarkable coming of age story of multiple exceptionally detailed characters, placing it in a league of its own.\n\nOverall the cast tells the story, and we believe that no technical quality or exceptional individual character can ever beat the synergistic effect of a beautiful well-rounded and complementary cast. We hope you appreciate the countless hours that went into finding a terrific cast everyone can enjoy.",

          "writeup": "*Uchuu Senkan Yamato 2202* features one of the largest casts of the year, with a fully-staffed space battleship.  The show doesn’t rely on deep character development to establish the crew of the Yamato, but rather gives a distinct impression that they all work together as a well-oiled machine.  However, this was detrimental to building up the characters as individuals, as they often faded into the singular entity that was the ship’s crew.\n\nThe show brings back many characters from its previous season, giving a variety of veteran and novice crew members.  The crew is reunited on the anniversary of Captain Okita’s death.  Kodai is burdened with more responsibilities as he struggles with the moral implications of using the Wave Motion Gun.  Captain Yamanagi eventually fills the role that Okita did as a serious veteran captain with a firm hand.  Many more named characters fill out the rest of the crew to efficiently carry out the mission of the Yamato. \n\nUnfortunately, these characters are contrasted with one-dimensional characters like Yuki, whose development is nullified repeatedly, cheapening her relationship with Kodai and the other crew members.  The new villains, the Gatlantians, are exceptionally similar to the previous season’s Gamilans.  It is fairly clear from the beginning that they will fill the same role, and few of the revelations about their race come as a surprise.\n\nUltimately, the show offered something that few other nominees did, but due to the weaknesses of the individual characters, the jury placed the cast of *Yamato* last.",

          "writeup": "*Kono Oto Tomare* got off to a rough start, its lightning fast pacing hurts the character writing for the first couple of episodes. However, as it went on, its cast really started to shine as one of the best of the year with its strong focus on teamwork and very well executed character arcs.\n\nOur three main characters, Takezou, Chika, and Hoozuki are all fleshed-out memorable characters each with their own backstories, motivations, and arcs over the course of the show. Their bond over their mutual interest in the koto is what brings them together initially but their complementary personalities and kindness towards each other keep them together. As for side characters, Akira is certainly the most notable. Despite not showing up until season two, she becomes  extremely memorable due to having one of the best character arcs of the season, her mentorship and interactions with the group being one of the main factors that lead to the strength of their performance at the end of the season. The other four side characters in the club are relatively inexperienced with the koto but they all share the same passion for the koto after seeing how fun it can be to play. Everyone started with their own hangups and personalities, Kurusu being the most fleshed-out of the four.\n\nAll of these aspects are what lead to this show  being placed so high in the jury’s  mind, however there were a few things holding this show back from first place. The rocky start to the show certainly didn’t help make a good first impression and some characters ended up not being as explored as others. Due to these factors, the jury decided that *Run with the Wind* was a better candidate, with *Kono Oto* taking the well deserved second place.\n",

          "writeup": "*Mob Psycho 100 II* greatly narrows its scope from the first season in terms of cast. Whereas in the first season we got growth and progression involving  numerous characters, the bulk of the second season is focused squarely on Kageyama Shigeo and Arataka Reigen. Undoubtedly this focus is well-earned, as Mob and Reigen have possibly the best characterization and development of any anime characters this year. However, because of this decision, many of the other compelling characters from season one are left by the wayside and they feel largely extraneous for the majority of the runtime.\n\nThere is a portion of the second half of the show when *Mob Psycho* leans on its supporting characters to carry the narrative, and that moment exposes how shallow the larger cast is; the show does not feel as enjoyable  without the presence  of either Reigen or Mob in every scene. The first season did not suffer from this same imbalance, and it seems to have been a specific narrative decision to structure this season in such a way that Mob's friends and family, as well as the former Claw members, get so little attention. That said, the handling of Mob and Reigen's characters in *Mob Psycho 100 II* is nothing short of masterful, and for that alone it surely merits recognition among the best casts of 2019.",

          "writeup": "*Vinland Saga*’s cast left most of the jury with similar thoughts. The general consensus is that, while *Vinland Saga* boasts a superb central cast with plenty of strong individual character moments around Thorfinn, Askeladd, Canute and Thorkell, the rest of supporting cast is considerably weaker. While there are a handful of strong, small, one-shot like character moments amongst the rest of *Vinland*’s cast, they tend to leave as fast as they arrive. This isn’t necessarily a negative, as all of these moments does the job that this story requires of them. This is due to how this arc in *Vinland* heavily revolves around the four pillars of the cast. While Thorfinn is technically our protagonist in this series, his development actually takes a backseat due to this arc being the prologue to his actual story. His role is  almost completely reactionary to the other three pillars in this story. Askeladd, Canute and Thorkell are the major players in *Vinland* and each one of them is littered with plenty of strong character moments. From learning how Askeladd came to be, Canute’s swift change of heart, and Thorkell’s desire to learn what it means to truly be a warrior, this trio all stand out immensely when compared to not only characters in the story to which they belong, but to any character across any medium of storytelling. So while *Vinland* does have relatively weaker supporting characters, the central cast easily makes up for that with its strong character moments and dynamics that rival most other shows in this category as a whole.",

From tough gangsters to psychopathic doctors, an emphasis is placed on ensuring that every character is different from the next. *Golden Wind*’s inclusion of personal Stands act not only as a form of attacking, but as a showcase of one's subconscious grievances or desires. Along with the backstories presented throughout, this adds another layer of depth to the main and supporting casts, which lacks from some of the lower ranking nominees. However with such a large cast some of these additions do not hit the mark, occasionally being detrimental to the overall experience.\n\n*Golden Wind*’s large mafia organization encompassing most of the cast introduces loyalty and trust as important traits to be shared within the various squads featured, allowing for even minor character interactions to have significance. However, this italian style caring family approach does not develop the cast as well as the other top ranking shows within this category such as *Kono oto Tomare* or *Run with the Wind*’s, both of which pride themselves on their team building capabilities. Even with its shortcomings, *Golden Wind* remains a positive addition to the *JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure* series and is definitely a show worth experiencing from this year.",

While the season definitely wasn't bad in terms of cast, it was hard to judge as the majority of the runtime was dedicated to the action in the first half and detailing on backstory in the second. As such, the cast had very few moments to shine, mostly being relegated to the high-level tactics and coordination in the Survey Corps that form the action scenes. However, some key moments did come through and impress many jurors, becoming some of the most iconic parts of the series for how they handle the cast. Examples include Erwin's grand speech to move the Survey Corps into throwing themselves at an unbeatable enemy and the heated arguments concerning a key moment involving Erwin and Armin later into the season. These moments represented the best of what the show can be and were spaced out quite nicely, making the show definitely worth a mention. The jurors would have preferred to see more moments like these, which unfortunately causes it to fall below its contemporaries, which had a myriad of such moments.",

Each character has to mesh or bounce off of the others in their own unique way, their VA's need to have chemistry when talking to each other, they need to be visually distinct, etc etc. A laundry list of things. \n\nThis list however is precisely why *Run With the Wind*’s, central cast is so impressive. It does this with a core cast of 10 nuanced and interesting core characters, each who could be called a lead, who talk and play off of each other like real people. Who have their own goals, personalities and arcs who support and grow together as people. Whether that be Prince's quest for inspiration, Nico's for health and his passion or Kurahara reigniting his passion for the sport, Each one has a distinct progression and everyone will be able to find at least one whom they connect with. All the while pulling in various side characters to fill a niche, but ultimately satisfying, role in the cast.\n\nThis adaptation of Shion Miura's original novel managed to tell multiple complete coming of age stories where many series struggle to tell one.

Ishigami, also known as “our guy”, is introduced halfway into the season, and the writers skillfully integrated him into the main cast. And last but not least, the most prominent supporting character of the series is Hayasaka, the voice of reason and the most level-headed person in the cast. While some jurors weren’t enthusiastic about the individual characters and the dramatic moments of the series didn’t work that well for them, we found common ground in enjoying the chemistry between the main cast members, which *Kaguya-sama* uses to great comedic effect.

Our third place pick, *Tsurune*, is an easy example of this; its exceptional execution of this style is what made it a clear frontrunner for us.\n\n*Tsurune* showcases animation excellence through graceful, elegant movements that impactfully portray the emotion of its characters. That’s in addition to maintaining a cohesive tone and atmosphere throughout its runtime; each cut perfectly compliments the art and direction to seamlessly flow through the story. While it may not be in-your-face, a close look into the deft character animation shows no lack of skill or effort from the team’s part. \n\nIn addition to the character animation, other highlights include the archery itself. These cuts carefully and accurately portray each step the athletes take during the ritualistic art of Kyuudou. The attention to detail ensures that while the story’s main focus is a character drama, the sport isn’t left behind in terms of visual fidelity either.\n\nFinally, *Tsurune’s* animation is praiseworthy beyond just a few key cuts and moments. The show maintains a consistent level of quality throughout its runtime with few dips, if any. All of these elements combined helped mark *Tsurune* as an easy contender for the top 3; while it just missed out on 2nd place, it deserves much of the same adoration as the two shows above it.",

However, despite *Wataten’s* high quality peaks, a majority of the show just stays above average.\n\nAt its best, *Wataten’s* lively and expressive character animation does wonders to convey the high energy of the main cast. The fluid motions are quite pleasant to watch, and the exaggerated movements fit the tone of the show well. Secondary motion through details like the cloth and hair animation also give the movements that much more life. *Wataten’s* tendency to even animate the characters who aren’t necessarily the focus of the scene or current dialogue helps keep the shots dynamic. Also, it’s also worth noting that the show accomplishes all this while constantly switching up the character’s outfits, a difficult but much appreciated extra layer of depth. Speaking of depth, *Wataten* also features a good amount of movement upstage and downstage, as opposed to just across the stage like usual.\n\nHowever, *Wataten’s* lower placement is due mostly to the notable dip in quality in the middle of the season. An increasing number of panning shots, stills, and rudimentary movements makes these middle episodes far more dull than its highlights. Most of these episodes still have a baseline level of quality above that of most slice-of-life shows; all the positives above are still present, just to a much lesser degree.

In spite of that, Studio Orange has taken it upon themselves to not only justify 3D animation's place in anime, but to prove that it can take center stage as well. *Beastars* is their latest effort towards this goal and it truly represents the pinnacle of what the studio can produce.\n\nBy using motion capture and recordings of voice talent as they act out their parts as reference, Studio Orange appropriately imparts the same natural motion expected of something like a stage play. Movements do not simply transition a model from point A to B; there's a distinct sense of weight and follow-through. Secondary movements in fur or clothing or tails add life and expressiveness to actions as basic as just standing and talking. This is all possible thanks to the intricately crafted character models that allow for degrees of freedom and expression not common in 3D TV anime.\n\nIn contrast, the occasional 2D side characters feel bland and lifeless, a mostly acceptable trade off to enable the quality 3D. That said, there are still fantastic scenes whose 2D animation compliments the CG, such as the brilliant colored pencil dream sequence from episode 7. Bringing these seemingly disparate elements together, *Beastars* is able to surpass 3DCG's reputation of being stiff and awkward, and stand proud as another stellar example from Studio Orange of the possibilities this style can provide.",

The work of Studio WIT is something to admire, and the highs of Season 3 Part 2 are quite impressive; unfortunately the limitations of this particular season become apparent later on.\n\nThis season starts strong with spectacular moments all throughout the long, multi-episode encounter. The 3D gear, of course, allows for exciting, dynamic movements, especially against the Beast Titan. The Armored Titan fights show impressive details in the movements, and the effects animation, like the explosive transformations, the hail of boulders, and the general debris, goes a long way in increasing the intensity of the battles. But just like Part 1, there's an issue of maintaining that level of quality. This season has its fair share of cuts where the action and movement doesn't flow smoothly. In particular, when the action scenes end, the lack of character animation becomes apparent. This is especially important because the second half of the season is where character acting should stand out the most, but that’s not the case here.\n\nWhile this season does deliver many well animated fight scenes, it's not enough to justify the low points in all of the exposition-heavy sequences, especially compared to some of the high points that the series is known for.

The action scenes are powerful and they flow effortlessly like Tanjiro's water breathing technique. Also, the impressive effect animation goes a long way in adding depth and impact to the actions, especially in the Spider Forest arc featuring Zenitsu’s special moves and episode 19’s third act. The integration of CG, especially in the Demon House or the Muzan scene in the final episode, is phenomenal and demonstrates ufotable’s skill in blending 2D animation and digital effects.\n\nThat being said, not all of the CG lives up to the hype; CG characters in wide shots are noticeably poor visually and they often seem too separate from background. The show also is noticeably weaker when it comes to character acting in both comedic and dramatic scenes.

There’s a high baseline of quality you can expect from each episode of *Mob* and never a moment where the animation felt lacking.\n\nThe action scenes have meaty impacts and impossibly smooth fight choreography; the sense of three-dimensionality and volume in just about every cut is phenomenal. The effects animation, from the vivid psychic energy to the devastating debris, further increases the impact. Especially commendable is how Mob utilizes its acting to enhance the characterization, from Mob’s emotional body language to Reigen’s sporadic hand smears. This also extends to the action scenes, like how Dimple makes people fight like zombies under his possession.\n\nBut above all, what makes *Mob* stand up so definitively is its visual experimentation. The use of mixed media, from Miyo Sato’s frequent paint on glass animation to the sand stop-motion in episode 1, is evidently pain-staking and used to its maximum capacity. Beyond that, the level of control every animator has over their cuts is awe inspiring; since each one brings their own unique flair, every episode feels new and unprecedented. It’s difficult naming standouts when each episode is so uniquely strong, but some jury favourites are Hayate Nakamura’s delightful 10th episode and Hakuyu Go’s legendary 5th episode. Allowing so many animators and directors to live in different styles and still make it cohesive is a monumental feat worthy of recognition.",

While we ultimately went with *Hulaing Babies*, *Sarazanmai*, *Ekoda-chan*, and *Fire Force* as our nominees, the jury spent considerable time discussing other worthy options like *Zoku Owarimonogatari*, *Wataten*, *Dororo*, and more.\n\nOur judging criteria focused on the harmonious compositing of the disparate elements which make up the final image, be it in the foreground, most notably key animation, but also special effects, CGI, and secondary layers; or the backgrounds which can be digital, 3D, or painted. A major emphasis was also put on the color design creating attractive balance and contrasts. Finally, we looked at the varied shifts in mediums that these shows employed for special occasions, stylized techniques like postcard memories, stop-motion, sand animation, puppetry, and how they served the mood and themes of each show.\n\nAfter much discussion of the nominees across the aforementioned criteria, our final votes resulted in a circular mathematical loop between our four front runners of *Hulaing Babies*, *Sarazanmai*, *Ekoda-chan*, and *Mob Psycho 100 II*. While this was eventually broken by a complicated voting algorithm that gave us our final rankings, all four of these shows could have easily walked away as deserving winners.

While quite a few other episodes also received smatterings of praise by different members of the jury, one episode that was resoundingly panned was episode 10 and its uncanny valley supermarionation which was deemed as going too far into WTF territory.\n\nThe show's inherent variability was also a negative for some members of the jury who felt that for every strong episode the show had there were an equal number of mediocre entries.

That style is the work of one man, Ryōzō Ōminato, who had practically complete control of the show’s aesthetics, as its character designer, art director, color designer, and animation director.\n\nPractically every aspect of *Hulaing Babies’* art style is fantastic, particularly its vivid color design, the simple yet distinct character designs, along with its fun and playful animation. Yet it was on how well all of its visuals meshed together as a cohesive style and how this was able to change to support the mood and tone of whatever was occurring in the show. A gag that puts this ability to great use is one where the characters begin to melt in the heat of summer. The scene is bathed in the harsh oppressive light of the sun and colors are tinted with warmer hues, and the characters' colored outlines viscously sweat into the background as they turn into amorphous blobs. The show can also turn down its brightness to be supremely serene, changing its palette to soothing lilacs and blues in scenes like Suzu drifting to sleep. Beyond these examples, the visuals in any given scene of this anime were crafted specifically to whatever Ōminato felt best supported the narrative, with everything from the colors to the characters subject to change.\n \n*Hulaing Babies’* fun and playful nature is well exhibited in its art style.

It's inspired gothic world design stood out even more. However, as is the nature with long-running TV productions, the very next episode had little of that, opting for a more standard, lower resource production. This contrast was a microcosm of the jury’s feelings on the show. Each beautiful scene was accompanied by parts that had to be scaled back to keep production on schedule.\n\n    The jury highly praised *Fire Force’s* use of, well, fire. The hand-drawn effects were often just one or two tones, allowing the animators to fully realize effects like few other shows have.  The fires being individualized for each user was a great touch and resulted in some fascinating powers, especially Hibana's flame flowers or Sho's feathers. However, due to its variety, there are some noticeably bad fire effects such as the poorly composited CG fires or Lisa's fires which look unnatural next to the characters and the world. The same can be said for the smoke effects which can look fantastic, particularly in episode 20, when Hinawa’s duel with Arrow took place. Unfortunately, when the smoke isn’t drawn, it is often rendered in mediocre CG.\n\nThe jury also found the show's usage of effective stylistic shifts like postcard memories to be remarkable, yet these were also a sign of the show's inherent inconsistencies which made it impossible to force it higher than 5th place.",

While the majority of these sections, along with Shingo Fuji’s kagenashi cop dance, were repeated throughout the show lessening their impact as the series goes on, it doesn't take away from the technical skill displayed in the striking color coordination of the blue-green waves in the henshin, the boldly silhouetted overlays during the confessionals, Teruko Utsumi's physical diorama for the Field of Desires, or the stark block coloring during the extraction sequence. \n\nEven beyond the bank material, the show expertly employs its varied stylistic influences from Ukiyo-e paintings to Japanese weather broadcasts. Takeo Ogiwara's clean compositing processes are easily able to merge these disparate elements into a seamless whole. The jury was particularly impressed with how he was able to integrate real-life props for the planning stages of the Sara heist, or how the finale boldly combines black-and-white memories on top of the bright red Azuma Bridge.\n\n*Sarazanmai* also cleverly connects its aesthetic choices to its themes. This is best typified by its usage of smoothly textured 3D backgrounds for the Otter headquarters which reinforces their artificial construction, especially in contrast with Studio Pablo's hand-painted backgrounds which accompany the rest of the show.

The positives were how it heightens the impact of a scene, like in the finale of the Giorno and Mista’s White Album fight where the majority of colours were muted and the inverted colours on the characters emphasised each move they made as well as the emotions of the scene. Negatives include some of the jarring choices of colour in colour inverted scenes. Another point of contention was the character designs, each being different from the next, with distinct colour schemes and attributes, but a majority of the jury found the designs themselves to be lacking. Aside from the disputed topics on the art style, the jury mostly came to a consensus for everything else.\n\nThe backgrounds throughout the show were mediocre, which ended up creating a stark contrast with the unique and distinct style of the characters. Since the background isn't able to complement the character designs, the overall look of the anime’s composites goes down. With the show’s unique features being controversial and the rest of the anime's style not being of a high standard, the jury ended up placing *JoJo* in 7th position. ",

It featured some of the trademark style and flair from ufotable which used its solid production to make the show look quite good. And while the show’s chief focus and boon is animation, the art style in *Yaiba* was also quite great. In particular, the water breathing was the highlight of the show’s art style as its “The Wave”-inspired stylization provided a unique way to tackle the battle scenes. Additionally, the thick line art for the characters was a feature that the jury liked.\n\nWhile *Yaiba* generally looks good, ultimately, there are a couple of notable flaws that bring it down. The CG is not very good and often introduces artifacts that mess with the art. The characters, for example, stood apart from the backgrounds behind them due to bad compositing. The 3d backgrounds also suffered from shoddy textures. The show also just didn’t stand out as much as the other shows in the category as it lacked innovation and uniqueness. While other nominees were able to utilize their art style to bring their shows to powerful heights or reveal information about the show itself, *Yaiba* was not able to do any of that. While it was still a good nominee due to its generally pleasing art style, its flaws sadly place it last in this category.",

Most jurors praised *Mob’s* flexibility in art and how it allowed the animators to express themselves fully in the styles they were comfortable in — be it the bursts of densely sketched cuts and detailed impact frames regularly employed in its sakuga scenes, or the cleaner, kagenashi sequences preferred by Hakuyu Go's congregation of webgen animators in episode 5. This freedom also allowed for the presence of idiosyncratic artists like Miyo Sato whose paint-on-glass and sand animation were always a highlight, singling out many important moments in the show like Reigen and Mob’s poignant initial meeting or Mob’s disastrous candidature speech. \n\n*Mob*, in general, had complete mastery over stylistic shifts, as it seemed to create special sequences - animated manga panels, homages to video games like Street Fighter, and more - just for fun. The jury particularly loved how the show utilized postcard memories for many of its punchlines, effectively contrasting their gravitas for gags. The only real gripes the jury had with the show was the plainer color schemes beyond the neon-colored supernatural sequences, and a distaste for ONE's singular designs expressed by a minority of jurors. \n\nOverall, *Mob Psycho 100* presented fans this year with a feast for the eyes and more than earns its third-place finish for the jury.",

Jurors placed especially heavy value on visuals that expand on characterization or theme through motif and symbolism.\n\nThe discussion was lively with jurors taking screencap after screencap of their favorite visual moments. While clashes might be expected for a competitive and technical category like this, what occurred instead was fans passionately showing each other their favorite sequences.\n\nThis year, non-2D animation stepped into the limelight, with two nominations predominantly made in 3DCG and one completely in stop-motion. Each held advantages in spatial utilization and lighting complexity, dispelling any notion that 3D is strictly inferior to 2D. These were seen in the energy and liveliness of *The Magnificent Kotobuki* and the subtler colors and compositions of *Rilakkuma and Kaoru*. Even traditionally-animated shows saw a rise in CG integration such as the action scenes of *Attack on Titan* and *Demon Slayer*.\n\nOne 3DCG series, *Beastars*, even managed to snatch the top spot but not without a fierce battle. *Sarazanmai* was a persuasive contender, with *Mob Psycho 100* not so far behind, but a close vote clinched it for Orange, who once again took the award for Best Cinematography.",

This show’s use of mise-en-scène and composition in peaceful and meaningful moments is rather beautiful, and the show's outstanding, naturalistic lighting helps to make the show feel more grounded, even with its surrealistic elements and out-of-left-field ideas such as the UFO visit in episode 11. These scenes where *Rilakkuma*’s main characters transition into imaginary land are nothing short of excellent, with one of the most prominent examples being the cherry blossom walk in episode 1.\n\nOn the other hand, some of the jury found the show’s scene-to-scene storyboarding to not be that impressive, and a lot of dialogue-driven scenes tend to be uninspired in their presentation. Some also thought that *Rilakkuma* 's storyboarding makes the punch lines of certain skits in the show less funny, mostly because of rather awkward editing that tries to deliberately not show the conclusion to some jokes. Despite some downsides, *Rilakkuma* charmed the jury with its beautiful directing and comfy atmosphere, earning its 5th place spot.",

With admittedly fewer peaks overall, but far fewer dips as well, *Araburu* was able to maintain a higher baseline standard of quality, establishing itself as subtle but effective.\n\nWhere *Araburu* shined most was its storyboarding and mise-en-scène. The show took advantage of both purposeful character blocking and frequent close focus on expressions to effectively convey the essential character emotions. Visual humor was abundant, and clever editing helped elevate the comedic timing of these gags as well. The editing was also effective in selling the visual metaphors throughout the show. Some metaphors, like the recurring riverbanks, were subtle and offered a glimpse into the character's mental state. Metaphors like trains entering tunnels, while amusing, were occasionally too in-your-face. Still, the inclusion of these poignant metaphors was an overall net positive, especially considering the literary nature of the show. \n\nDespite *Araburu*’s consistently good storyboarding, its more tame nature gave it fewer opportunities for exceptional boarding. In addition, the lighting and color palette of the show - aside from a few standout scenes such as episode 8’s play and bonfire confession - was less impressive as well. Unrealistic uniform scene lighting and a pale color palette offered fewer opportunities for interesting contrasts. Topped off with an ever-present white paper filter that gave the show an odd texture, these lighting decisions held back the show a bit. Regardless, the purposeful storyboarding and meaningful visual metaphors make *Araburu* a memorable 6th place. ",

          "writeup": "*Kotobuki* was one of the biggest surprises of the year. Anime relying heavily on CG animation are often dismissed immediately solely off of the type of animation being utilized, but *Kotobuki* blew all expectations out of the water and sent them sky high. Kotobuki prides itself on its aerial sequences, which are rich with incredibly well-thought-out perspectives and transitions.\n\nThis is especially evident during dogfights, where multiple planes’ movements need to be accounted for. Point of view is shifted frequently, depending on the intensity or focus of a scene. No area is left out, with shots from within the cockpit used during conversations, from the wings when in pursuit, and even facing the planes head on to showcase an approaching attack. The variety of these types of shots is refreshingly engaging and keeps you strapped into your seat. Scenes are so dynamic that at times you truly feel like you are in the moment, closing in on an enemy fighter who is threatening a fellow pilot.\n\nThese dogfights are wonderfully lit, during both day and night, and these easy to follow scenes span the majority of the show. However, the moments back in the bay or on the ground are another story. The shift is certainly noticeable, featuring rather dull framing and questionable 2D animation integration at times, but the overall experience is still above average with its lovely lighting and perspective choices. Dipping from the heights of the aerial segments placed it below the aces, but *Kotobuki* definitely claims its place among the stars.",

          "writeup": "It is impossible to divorce *Sarazanmai* from its creator. Kunihiko Ikuhara’s shows always have a distinct style to them; their shot composition and storyboarding are full of personality and visual metaphors. However, this is not just due to Ikuhara himself, but also the incredibly talented storyboarders he surrounds himself with. The work of chief director Nobuyuki Takeuchi, who storyboarded episodes 4 and 9, stands out in particular. This pair of episodes shows off the best *Sarazanmai* has to offer. Every cut is engaging in some way: some are distant shots with fantastic blocking, or closeups with interesting angles, and yet others that play with color and lighting to enhance the scene. Takeuchi’s use of shadows deserves particular mention, as it made Toi’s flashback in episode 4 a highlight of the show. In the finale the debutant Maimu Matsushima also impresses with his bold framing of black-and-white memories which contrast with a colored present.\n\nThe jury also praised the heavy use of visual metaphors, such as the boxes that represent the hidden desires people drag around with them. There are also shots that poke at the meta-narrative itself, revealing the spotlights used for “lighting” the scene and reminding the viewer that what they are watching is not reality. Lastly, the repeated transformation is one of the best scenes in the series, though some felt it was overused to the detriment of the series. Regardless, it is a minor issue in light of *Sarazanmai*’s accomplishments and highly consistent production, which awarded the anime a fitting second place finish.",

          "writeup": "*Mob Psycho 100* is most known for its brilliant and creative animation, but the staff does its utmost to make every scene stand out through dynamic storyboarding. Its direction adapts to suit any scene; in a conversation, it will play up the power dynamics between characters, or use framing and postcard memories to punctuate punchlines. In an action scene, it will focus on making the fight transitions easy to follow. In a contemplative scene, it will use lighting to enhance the mood.\n\nHighlights of the show included episode 5, where the use of color, blocking, and camera angles emphasizes Mob’s isolation, and Episode 7, where Reigen’s personal conflict is resolved with creative transitions like having the point of view come through the camera to focus on him, or a spinning transition from a flashback of Mob’s early impressionable self to a relieved present-day Reigen. All the stops are pulled in episode 11 in the fight against Ryo Shimazaki, whose teleportation power is masterfully presented using the camera movements in sync with Shimazaki’s sudden appearances and disappearances to keep up the suspense while still flowing between shots.\n\nIf there was anything to critique the show for, it was that some fights still end up hard to follow due to a focus on experimental and loose animation. Ultimately Mob places third because the jury was even more in love with the cinematography of the shows above it. Still, *Mob Psycho 100 II* remains an excellent showcase of direction and an absolute triumph.",

          "writeup": "*Kimetsu no Yaiba*’s biggest asset is Yuichi Terao's lighting scheme, which greatly enhances the show’s already fantastic VFX to stand out with even more brilliance. However, this comes with a marked trade-off as it shrouds the show’s unending series of dimly lit forests with monotone grays, which the jury found to be a dreary viewing experience. Notably there were rare but powerful highlights where the anime does show off colorful lighting such as the small arc set in the exuberant Taisho-era recreation of Asakusa or the gorgeously lit Wisteria flowers at Fujikasane Mountain where Terao’s photorealism shined for the jury.\n\nWhen it comes to storyboarding the show’s biggest calling card was its utilization of 3d backgrounds to facilitate dynamic camerawork which worked wonders in the tightly constrained funhouses present in episodes 12 and 26. However, the jury often felt distracted by its unmotivated usage for outdoor sweeping shots that regularly lost track of characters and foregrounded blandly uniform scenery. The show is primarily storyboarded by its director, Haruo Sotazaki, whose workmanlike boards were largely content with slavishly recreating manga panels instead of exploiting the strengths of the medium. This uninspired approach permeates the entire show with few exceptions such as the famous episode 19 that prominently features dramatic dutch angles and slow-motion shots. \n\nWhile *Yaiba*’s strengths are immediately obvious, it couldn’t slay all of its demons when it came to cinematography, landing it in the penultimate position.",

It does this through the shots that take advantage of the series’ iconic, free-flowing camerawork, such as in Levi vs. the Beast Titan, or Mikasa vs. the Armored Titan. Additionally, the clever framing effectively raises the stakes of many scenes, like the ways it emphasized the size difference between titans and humans.\n\nOutside those noteworthy scenes, the season simply does what it needs to get the job done, with lucid shot composition. By no means is it bad, but the series rarely uses its blocking to convey anything beyond the events on screen, or go out of its way to provide a unique experience. This is especially relevant after the cinematography shifts disappointingly halfway through the season, when the show could no longer be carried by its 3D maneuver gear. Many of the jurors were also disappointed with the basic approach to lighting and dull color palette which were constants throughout the season. \n\nNext to its competitors, which featured meaningful blocking, lighting, or coloring, the bar is too high for *Attack on Titan Season 3 Part 2*, which loses out in comparison.",

          "writeup": "Animation studio Orange proved with *Houseki no Kuni* that they were a talented team of artists worthy of recognition. With *Beastars*, they have established themselves as masters of the cinematic craft. Nearly every frame is painterly in its visuals, with artful compositions and a bold use of colors and lighting that creates striking images. The latter is a particularly exceptional aspect of *Beastars*’ cinematography; the show's lighting feels theatrical, with its glaring spotlights and soft moonlight, and many scenes dazzle with splashes of vivid color, like episode 1’s fountain scene with its purple haze or the tubes of paint bursting in Legosi’s hand in episode 7. The show utilizes sweeping camera motions and dynamic character movement within the frame to give further presence to dramatic scenes like those in episode 4’s theater sequence, while also knowing when to slow down and linger for its more delicate moments, such as the mountaintop scene between Legosi and Haru in the final episode.\n\nOrange has also shown with *Beastars* that they are unafraid of being experimental with their cinematography, as evident by the creative utilization of split-screens, double exposure, and forays into wildly different visual styles, such as the dreamy watercolor sequence in episode 7 or the gripping paper theater sequence in episode 9. While these elements are undeniably conspicuous, they also come together seamlessly to craft the show’s unique visual language. The confidence and artistry in *Beastars*’ cinematography is laudable, and for that the jury gladly awards it first place in the category.",

It showcases an excellent usage of letterboxing and pillarboxing during the interrogation scenes, swapping back and forth depending on the conversation. Perspective shots are utilized wonderfully to capture which character is dominating the discussion, even splitting and pressing frames together to highlight the suspect-to-interrogator shift of focus.

We had an incredible diversity of choice ranging from *Dororo* 's modern update of Tezuka's classic designs to *Wataten* 's refinement of current trends in moe designs, and from *Sarazanmai*’s clean volumetric designs to *Cautious Hero*’s loosely exaggerated, flat designs.\n\nGiven such an array of choices, we unanimously decided to come up with a set of metrics to help us adjudicate these candidates, including animation friendliness i.e the mutability of lines and shapes for expression; recognizability of silhouetted forms; coloring and shading, costumes and accessories; and an overall perspective on how these designs reflected the personalities and abilities of any character and changed as their narrative progressed. With these criteria in place, we near-unanimously shortlisted our final four nominees in the form of the ever-fashionable *Aikatsu Friends*, the reinvented *Pokémon Sun & Moon*, the diverse *Carole & Tuesday*, and the constantly experimental *Hulaing Babies*. Even the public nominees were fantastic here, each having their own unique strengths, with *Mob*’s infinite malleability, *Jojo*’s metropolitan costuming, *Yaiba*’s striking outlines, and *Beastars*’ refined expression.\n\nAfter finishing up on our herculean binges of over 300 eps in six weeks, the jury came together for a final round of discussion. Here, we rather surprisingly found that the jury almost entirely agreed in our ranking of the nominees, with the exception of a fiercely contested battle between *Aikatsu* and *Pokémon*. While *Aikatsu Friends* was eventually crowned the winner, the exceptional qualities of the rest of the designs nominated in this category all deserve recognition and praise.",

The show's designs were created by Ryozo Ominato, who also did the color design, art direction, and animation direction of the show. This supreme control over aesthetics allowed him to purposefully push boundaries of form and color to their limits. The show plays with its colored line art with suitable color changes to make the characters stand out from its ever-changing pastel backgrounds. It also often drops the outlines altogether for an arresting effect, or distorts them to showcase emotion. It is so experimental that it’s completely comfortable dropping everything but the character’s outlines for a gag.\n\nIt has uniquely lanky silhouettes for anime, which allows its small team to pull off extremely fluid demorphing motions a surprising number of times, given its production realities. The designs themselves are smart, as they typify characters with unique features which allow the characters to remain recognizable amidst all these experimental shifts. These include accessories such as Nagisa's cross-shaped scrunchie, which also signifies her injured status in the show; hairdos like Mona's voluminous twintails that can hilariously transform into legs or wings as she desires; or shapes, as best highlighted by the disparate height difference between the manzai duo of Miku and Moe. It also features some gorgeous costumes, particularly their hula dresses.\n\nThis degree of experimentation is, of course an acquired taste, which could easily put off some viewers as it did for some jurors. This is why the show could only hula as far as a respectable fourth place in our rankings.",

Satomi Watanabe’s accomplished design work fully exploits this by creating a truly jaw-dropping and fitting wardrobe for all of its characters, in particular the main duo, where Aine's warm personality is carried over in her frilly pastel pink attires, while Mio's cool attitude is reflected in her chic minimalist outfits. However, it doesn't stop there as these designs have well-balanced proportions, distinct silhouettes, and appealing color grading across the board. The jury went especially gaga over the design’s utilization of hair gradients for both its main duo and its large side cast including Hibike's ostentatious magenta-peach ombre that matches her fiery personality as well as the neat inversion of midnight blue-silver ombre in the Shirayuki twins, which signals both their fortune-telling roots and the distinctness in their personalities. \n\n*AiFure* can be divided into distinct segments — the CG animated idol dances and the traditionally animated slice-of-life goodness; with the designs transitioning seamlessly between both mediums. The jury was particularly fond of the CG rigging of these designs as they allowed for spell-bounding performances with minute attention paid to varying stiffness of the fabric that made its ridiculously detailed dresses, and how that affects their flowing motion. On the other hand, the hand-drawn portions of the show are expectedly limited in production given its long-running roots. They aren't without merit though as their versatility allows them to showcase a wide variety of one-off Aikatsu activities - shout out to Mahou Shoujo Mirai and Macaroon Mio.\n\nIn conclusion, the power of *Aikatsu* pushed these friends just enough to take away the crowning jewels.",

An example of this, is Suiren’s badass and impish nature, contrasting her small frame & innocent looks, which enhances her comedic moments. When coupled with her water motif (sailor uniform, swimsuit, wave pattern, knots and colors), she quickly stood out as one of our favorite trainer designs. However, *Pokémon’s* true highlight is the monster designs. “Who’s that Pokémon”, showcase how easily the monsters pass the silhouette test, often letting us determine their personalities based on shapes and colors. By focusing on cartoony animations & expressions, smoothing out some of the sharper lines, and improving the fur texture for some monsters, they feel more alive than past generations. This makes episodes that focus on interaction between Pokémon a highlight, especially from the perspective of our favorite bean bag owl, Rowlet. The character designs lend themselves well as framework for alternative styles, allowing it to get experimental, both in art style and shape, while still being easily distinguishable.\n\nWhile *Sun & Moon* ultimately lost to *Aikatsu Friends* due to having fewer standout human designs & costumes, its streamlined designs which allowed consistent animation throughout its 146-episode run were enough to pocket the 2nd place.",

As such, considering the simplicity of the original character designs by ONE, the fact that this effect is in full force for *Mob Psycho II*, where every member of its large cast has a unique presence, is quite outstanding.\nOf course, a lot of it is the work of Yoshimichi Kameda’s adaptation of the original character designs, making them wildly adaptable to different styles, from extremely rough, sketchy line art to scenes without shadows or even lines. The crudeness of the character art even allows for comedic uses where the artstyle of the show reverts to black and white or the designs get used in experimental ways, such as in episode 7 where Reigen gets so humiliated he loses a dimension.\nYet, the simplified designs can also work against the show in terms of variety and moxie. The latter particularly shows in the designs of the antagonists of the second half, which again are intentionally simple to make them fit later in the side cast (like Claw did in this season), yet still lack the charisma that a villain/antagonist requires to ground the conflict fully.\nAs such, while *Mob's* psychotically motile designs share a similar design philosophy with SuMo, it has a few pitfalls that make it not stack up as much as the entries rated above it.",

The faces are well-rigged and were able to express minute emotions in ways that are much more difficult to do with 2D animation.  However, the detail and consistency of the designs tended to make the designs somewhat inflexible.\n\nA show using anthropomorphized characters could easily lean too heavily on stereotypical portrayals of the animals’ personalities.  *Beastars* sidesteps this by conveying personality heavily through posture.  Legosi’s hunched posture is nontypical of wolves, who, even in the world of *Beastars*, are stereotyped as aggressive.  Likewise, one would expect the dwarf rabbit Haru to be a timid herbivore, but she stands proudly.  The characters have excellent silhouettes, displaying a large variety of shapes and sizes.\n\nCharacter designs rely on more than posture and silhouettes, though, and *Beastars* fails to impress on other fronts.  As a show with school uniforms, the wardrobes are limited, and there isn’t much variety outside the drama club.  The model rigging does not allow for the bending or morphing of the characters' bodies to convey motion or comedy.  These aspects make the designs feel rigid.  Several animals were scaled strangely, such as the birds, Aoba and Legom.  Some jurors also had problems with the inconsistency of the fur texturing outside the main characters.\n\nIn the end, the jury determined that these shortcomings were too much, and we chose to place *Beastars* last.",

Eisaku Kubonouchi's original designs are a highlight of the show, and the jury had very few negatives to say about them at all. Their biggest strength is their ability to express parts of the characters' personalities with no exposition at all, through smart outfit and hairstyle decisions. One can immediately tell that Tuesday is a sheltered, rich girl with her luscious hairstyle and preppy attires, or discern Angela's confident diva status with her bold posturing. Also impressive is the variety of outfits the characters wear, with most of the cast having multiple well-designed and personable outfits. The obvious exceptions are Carole and Gus who have a limited wardrobe consisting of functional streetwear due to their initial financial conditions -- an expert case of designs tying into the narrative of the show.\n\nThe proportions of the designs are pretty realistic which is why they work so well during its rotoscoped performances, but they also easily transition into less detailed styles to induce levity. The jury also praised the show’s large diverse cast, with characters of many body shapes, sizes, and colors signifying the cosmopolitan nature of the show's setting. The elegant Flora or the meme-ready Mermaid sisters were especially memorable despite their one-off appearances. The only real negative for the jury were the fairly generic designs of recurring characters like Tao and Roddy which somewhat doused the enthusiasm generated by the show's strengths elsewhere.\n\n*Carole & Tuesday*’s character designs are exceptional—recognizable and commendably diverse, but the show never reaches the heights of some of its competitors, leaving the jury to place it at a still impressive third place.",

However, the designs of other characters were more controversial – while some jurors liked the designs of the Hashira, the remaining characters drew little praise from the jury. With the potential exception of the Spiders, the demons were received mostly negatively, as they felt significantly less interesting than the designs of the main characters and were largely mediocre overall. The jury was also mixed on how the show used its unique design elements – the bold lines during close-ups weren’t consistently used and the use of colors in characters’ eyes and hair weren’t consistent in quality. In particular, Mitsuri Kanroji’s hair and the use of blockier colors at times was viewed particularly negatively. Similarly, while jurors liked details like Nezuko’s eyes, they were far more mixed on the eyes of other characters.

They make heavy use of harsh lines and shading, rather than opting for gradients. Takahiro Kishida chose to depict shadows darkly, sometimes even bordering on solid blacks with defined borders. This forms a nice contrast with the designs' metropolitan and flamboyant colors. These designs are also wonderfully varied and memorable, often incorporating elements of the characters' personalities and abilities. Buccellati's outfit is riddled with zippers, while Purple Haze looks as wild and uncontrollable as its power. While most of the jury liked the designs overall, everyone recognized that this incredible attention to detail ended up working against the show. The production team was not able to keep up with the detail, and much of the show has the models moving around in rough, unnatural motions, or not moving at all. Scenes that manage it perfectly, like Giorno’s interactions with the police officers in episode 1, only serve to highlight how short the rest of the show falls. Details in designs may be vital, but crafting designs that the animation team can fully utilize is even more important.

However, if you take the time and effort to focus on the scenery you’re treated to an incredibly wide arrangement of pastel colors that work wonderfully with its character design and the bubbly tone of the series. In those rare moments where the series does  take time to highlight its scenery, it is well composed. This knowledge makes things all the worse in the moments where the scenery isn't highlighted. Where *Hulaing* further loses some credit is that its large range of colors and the way they are combined sometimes feels arbitrary, excessive, or distractive. While the abstraction is appreciated from an aesthetic standpoint, it does make the scenery at times feel unpolished, especially due to previously mentioned color choices that feel arbitrary and lacking in focus on the scenery. Still, there’s no doubt that *Hulaing Babies* has unique and memorable scenery that stands out this year.\n",

          "writeup": "*Null and Peta* comes in at fourth place for background art this year. It had a unique art style that was reminiscent of a picture book, and made use of a wide color palette that complimented the art style and helped create a warm tone. The show featured a wide variety of backgrounds ranging from Null’s steampunk laboratory, beautiful cityscapes, and somehow outer space. On top of being well made backgrounds, the art helped express Peta’s loneliness and isolation from the world; at times brilliant pastel shading was juxtaposed with darker colors and textures to build onto Peta’s psych. \nThe background art in this show stands out in a medium that is dominated by formulaic and cliche backgrounds. The outrageously abstract style immediately gave it character rivaled only by the winner *Zoku Owarimonogatari* and *Hulaing Babies*. Much like *Hulaing* though, overall detail and polish do not stand up to the best of the category. As such it scores fourth place for the year, and outstanding achievement for a show of it’s class but still a few steps away from the grand prize. \n",

An abundance of earthy colors sets the mood for a depressing world constantly haunted by the fear of attack. WIT studio's trademark harsh linework further emphasizes this unforgiving feeling. While other highly detailed gritty anime have emerged, *Kyojin* maintains a unique aesthetic in it's backgrounds that is unmistakably its own. New this season includes the famous ocean scene with it's brilliant splashes of color and light that so starkly contrasts the usual darkness.\n\nNevertheless, the anime landscape has come a long way since 2013, and what was iconic and industry leading back then faces stiff competition in 2019. Many have noted that *Kyojin* feels repetitive and almost boring with it's style leaving little room for variety. The detailed architecture that once was a standout struggles to compete with the more stylized buildings of *Kimetsu* or *Fire Force*. Against the overwhelmingly abstract backgrounds from other contenders, *Kyojin* simply fails to stand out. Even while we placed this show in last place overall it is important to remember that *Kyojin* has taken impressive steps forward from what was beloved in the past. The rest of the industry has simply taken even more titanic strides to pass it.\n",

The show adds the same manga-like flair to its backgrounds as it does for the characters, with a wide variety of beautiful colors and rough deliberate linework. They are incredibly well done and add to the dark gritty atmosphere of this season’s thrilling story. From a sprawling metropolis to green rolling countryside there is no shortage of interesting settings and locations throughout the series. Psychic battles are worthy of note as well with splashes of bright vibrant colors and trippy visuals that set up crazy and mind bending battles. Mob’s fight with Toichiro at the end of the series is made all the more intense with various shades of red to represent the impending destruction of the world as shattered buildings fly in all directions. \n\nThat being said, while *Mob Psycho* creates an interesting aesthetic that matches its story well, it struggled to stand out among the competition. Lower budget shorts relying on aesthetic alone took more risks for more memorable results while other shonen entries such as *Fire Force* and *Vinland* deliver brilliant show defining scenes that *Mob* in terms of backgrounds can't seem to match. A solid baseline of competency did well to help qualify this show but is not enough to make us rank it high on our list.\n",

Areas associated directly with the Demon Slayer Corps, such as the Wysteria forest and the mansion headquarters, conveyed a sense of serene beauty. The introduction to the city, and a few key locations within the spider forest are also depicted with care, providing them with a sense of identity.\n \nUnfortunately, many of the other backgrounds fell into the generic fantasy fare with nondescript forests, hills, and rooms. While not poor, they were on the forgettable end. Aside from variety, the series' backgrounds didn't always manage to marry its bold, expressive, highly stylized characters with its nearly photo-realistic natural landscapes. As a result they sometimes clashed, especially in ambient moments where less focus was paid to visual fidelity. Overall, the show's backgrounds were created well, but they failed to stand out often enough to overtake the higher ranked entries.\n",

Locations had very distinct architectural styles ranging from western-influenced cathedrals, to the tight streets of modern Tokyo, and even the traditional Japanese style of Asakusa. This variety of settings still felt unified thanks to the ever-present pipes and machinery of the steampunk aesthetic. Unfortunately not every background was of the city, and background art of building interiors and those of the Abyss were noted as being relatively uninteresting.\n\nColor-design and lighting were two other points we discussed together as being note-worthy in *Fire Force’s* backgrounds. Much of the color in *Fire Force’s* backgrounds is influenced greatly by the lighting present. Scenes that departed from the norm were generally those that were bathed in warm red-orange hues cast by the setting sun or those in the dark underground far from its light. The intense lighting and coloring of these backgrounds was noted to help distinguish the backgrounds from others in the field and kept the show visually interesting.\n\nOverall, *Fire Force* was a favorite for the jury with its detailed urban settings receiving a large amount of praise. Color-design and lighting within the backgrounds was also noted and helped to keep things visually interesting.",

It has garnered high praise from the anime community for its attention to art and color design as well as the way it uses visual storytelling.

In addition to the outstanding color choices and composition that we know and love, *Zoku Owarimonogatari* incorporates its scenery in portraying its themes about reflecting and mirroring. It makes sense it does this, since the arc is so inherently focused on understanding the new environment that Araragi finds himself in. \n\nThe scenery is often composed symmetrically and reflections in the puddles and windows are highlighted during scenes that discuss the nature of this mirror world. The environments are brighter and more vivid than we usually see from the *Monogatari* series, which ends up tying into the narrative as Ougi explains that 20% of the light is absorbed into the mirror. In addition to the way it reflects the narrative beats, the scenery in *Zoku Owari* features a selection of new environments. The addition of these new locations, such as Kiss-Shot’s castle, bring even more new life into the city that the series is set in. \n\nWith the unprecedented narrative strength, new locations, and color and composition that’s stronger than ever *Zoku Owari* exceeds expectations when it comes to scenery, even while being part of a franchise that has set extremely high expectations for its visuals.\n",

In comparison to the vivid colors of fall in the beginning of *Vinland Saga*, a majority of the latter half of the show was spent during the winter and featured bland scenic shots of snow. In addition, while Vinland Saga had excellent scene composition and impressive lighting choices, the background art was not as stylistically strong or unique when compared with *Fire Force* and *Zoku Owarimonogatari* which had similarly gorgeous background art. \n",

Kiss Me and Wild Side were both impeccably animated sequences that perfectly captured the entire tone of a show. OPs that should be bog standard on paper, like Rin! Moon! Dass!

The jury took multiple narrative and aesthetic factors into account with differing degrees of importance depending on each creative team’s priorities or aspirations.\n\nMeasuring the strength of an OP invited multi-faceted debates about visual storytelling, animation quality, and the juxtaposition of art with sound. We also considered whether each element supported one another strongly enough to bring a creative vision to light. While our top three were generally well-received by most of the jury, almost every other entry was hotly debated before deciding on our final lineup. While many of our lower-ranking OPs still had their fair share of passionate cheerleaders, in the end we finally came to the order you see here.",

Another fantastic cut follows the bath scene, with multicolored lyrics pacing the floor whilst Ao-chan runs through the room as books swirl around her. The context and foreshadowing in the OP are also quite strong, depicting several of the characters' personalities in a short timespan.\n\nThe jury felt that this OP set the tone for the show with a fun and bouncy audio-visual experience.

The lyrics immediately grab the listener’s attention with the first line: “Yo. Mic Check.” They’re out of the norm and wouldn’t be  typically expected from the start of an OP.\n\nThe visuals explore this in further depth as they mimic a student film project, presenting daily life at the school. The first half of the OP is filled with expressive character animation that displays who the characters are, and the kind of humour they might be able to bring. An easy example would be when Baka photobombs Robo, indicating that she is a character who revels in the spotlight and loves attention. \n\nThe second half of the OP contains the chorus drop and the stop motion segment.  Although this leans on the irregular, the opening doesn’t lose focus and continues to present the characters in all their absurdity. This stop motion works with the premise of the OP, since it displays the characters as they want to be seen in front of the camera. \n\nAll in all, we felt that Rin! Moon Dass!

It does a phenomenal job of utilizing layers to add depth to sequences as well as incorporating creative picture-in-picture visuals. This is showcased well with the intense battle-focused second half of the opening, which presents fluidly animated cuts in interesting spaces; such as on the blade of a sword, that do not detract from its flow. These moments alone elevate the opening above the other action-focused nominations.\n\nThematically, the opening is also solid. It makes subtle connections to characters and events with its visuals and transitions, even if it can be a little on the nose at points. The filters help to support the harsh and grim tone of the show, while occasional splashes of vivid and defined colour serve to contrast this tone and signify hope and perseverance. Throwbacks to the original manga and anime add personality and charm to the opening, which supported both its connection to the story while also helping it stand strong on its own.\n\nLyrically the song relates back to core concepts from the story, while individual verses are also highlighted in the visuals; fire is visible when sung, as is lightning when light is mentioned. The song is varied throughout and synchronizes tightly with the visuals. The vocals were lacking compared to the other top ranked nominations; especially with the screaming portions, however there are many points that blend in nicely.\n\nBeyond that, Kaen is an exemplary opening from this year and easily secured its position in the top half of the ranking.",

          "writeup": "Gurenge continues the proud tradition of shounen openings that combine fight animation from the show with a catchy song to create hype. LiSA provides dynamic vocals that tread both frenetic, action-packed territory together with slower, more emotional tones, in a way that flows seamlessly together that left the jury highly impressed. Both Tanjiro's triumphs and struggles, as well as the camaraderie he experiences with Zenitsu and Inosuke, come across loud and clear in large part thanks to the effective tone that the song sets for their presentation. The use of Tanjiro's signature water animation to make shots flow fluidly between each other in the fight portions of the OP was also a high point for the jury.\n\nDynamic song and impressive transition animation aside, a majority of the jury did take significant issue with the fact that Gurenge stayed so close to the generic shounen OP formula, and that it relied so heavily on recycled shots from the show instead of presenting viewers with new material to help strengthen its message. While it did create hype, both for fights that had already occurred and ones that the viewer had yet to experience, most jurors felt that the OP could have done so more effectively by including more footage unique to the OP instead of just retreading what was portrayed in the series. The use of fairly static images to introduce many of the side characters was also considered a weakness.\n\nOverall, the jury felt that Gurenge was one of the better executions of your standard shounen OPs, but competing against finalists that were much more unique and creative, its heavy reliance on tropes and lack of innovation ultimately consigned it to tenth place in the final vote.",

          "writeup": "Love Dramatic is a unique and visually distinctive entry that pays homage to old spy thrillers to introduce the cast and premise of the show. It presents very literal imagery, depicting love as war, which was a fun twist on the premise and set the tone for the show and its shenanigans. In addition to the introduction of the relationship of the two mains, Chika’s introduction was handled excellently with grenades in the background highlighting her explosive personality and wild card role in the show. \n\nUnfortunately the jury felt the opening was split into two good halves that were somewhat awkwardly stitched together. The kaleidoscope effect is a good example of a feature which while being gorgeous to look at, also felt out of place and to be of little substance. The many different styles of the OP ended up being its greatest flaw, as the jury felt like the core message that was being delivered was muddled as a result.\n\nThe jury found positives and negatives in the music. The jazz instrumental helped set the mood and the chorus was catchy, while the lyrics were found to be forgettable by many. However the song’s tight synchronization with the visuals was largely praised, with the quadruple takes being a prime example of the opening’s cohesion.\n\nLove Dramatic has its strengths and weaknesses, and while it had a lot to like, the inconsistent messaging was the deciding factor that meant it didn’t place higher. As the year was already filled with incredible openings these problems resulted in Love Dramatic placing ninth.",

          "writeup": "Wild Side was an absolute standout this year when it came to OPs. It took an already unique story and artstyle and applied stop motion animation, a technique rarely used in anime, and the jury praised this decision to think so far out of the box. While having a fairly minimalistic narrative, the OP packs an impressive amount of metaphor and meaning into its scenes. For instance, its focus on the celestial bodies were a creative way of showing changes in nature and lighting throughout the OP. It also gave its entire focus to its main characters, foregoing any sort of standard character introduction and excluding all side characters to better keep that focus.\n\nDespite the lauded animation and direction, the jury had a few hangups on the song choice. While it utilized its tone and sounds in an appropriate way and matched the animation fairly well, the grungy sound and barely understood “English” lyrics gave pause. A different singer might have delivered vocals that would have pushed Wild Side into further acclaim. The way the walk cycles were animated at the beginning of the OP was also criticized.\n\nUnlike many of the other OPs this year, Wild Side pushed the envelope, testing just how far they can take an unconventional approach to anime and succeed. While the animation itself saw wild praise, the jury believed the song choice acted as an anchor, dragging what could have been a perfect OP into an exceptional OP, landing it squarely in second place.",

The explicit references to older animation techniques were received positively, and the fight sequence at the end was called out as being of very high quality. The ‘domino sequence’ was considered a refreshingly gorgeous take on the trope of character cards that avoided the typical complaints of the trope by introducing an extensive amount of animation to keep things from getting stale and using the idea of dominos to provide structure.\nTaken individually, most parts of this opening were certainly solid, but, as a whole package it was found to be somewhat lacking. Some jurors found it to be too busy and overwhelming while others took issue with the lack of a coherent structure or narrative through line that joined the many disparate parts. Still others felt that while the visuals were great, the fact that it didn’t attempt to characterize the cast or have other contextual value was a negative.\nThe response to the music was also a mixed bag. Some jurors really liked the song and felt it was a fine follow-up to the highly successful 99, praising the frenetic lyrical delivery as appropriately energetic. Others took issue, particularly with some of the English pronunciation, in some cases feeling it was a deal-breaker for the entire opening.\n At the end of the day, though, these criticisms are more indicative of what separates the cream of the crop, and being a feast for the eyes certainly means it merited consideration as one of the better openings of the year.",

This dichotomy of sound characterizes the OP,  and matches the emotions that the heroines of the show are experiencing; that being those of casting aside pretenses and letting raw feelings show through. This is also reinforced by the loud and aggressive piano, which is played with violent abandon.\nThe visuals also portray the sadness and anguish present in the show effectively. The selective coloring of certain shots served to demonstrate how each girl seduced the protagonist. The jury particularly praised the two shots of Momo and Miu running while their reflections stayed behind, which represent the hesitancy present in their decisions. \nThe jury however also felt that the visuals did not characterize the cast well enough, especially in regards to the protagonist Natsuo barely being present in the OP, save for two short appearances. While being badass, the shots of piano playing was also criticized as the piano player herself never appears in the show, which meant that the OP didn’t contextualize its show quite as well as many of its competitors.In the end, these shortcomings were the reason we chose to place Kawaki wo Ameku in sixth place.",

From the myriad of dance EDs to the abstract, minimalistic,and absolutely breathtaking, this year’s jury had a lot of options to choose from. In particular, the jury was torn on whether to nominate Happy Happy Friends from *Wataten!*, Don’t Stop Moving from *Business Fish*, or Unlasting from *Sword Art Online: Alicization War of Underworld*, which - although intriguing in their unique and deliberate style - ultimately did not end up making our final cut.\n\nOur final selection consists of both popular, well-loved EDs such as Chikatto Chika Chika and Stand By Me,while also featuring some  more abstract and obscure ones, such as Wasa Wasa Wasa, and Oshiete!... Twinkle.\n\nFinally, we ranked our nominees. This was a tough decision to make, considering the uplifting music of Kago no Naka no Bokura wa, the beautiful cityscapes  of Stand by Me, and the charismatic dance routine from Chikatto Chika Chika, among a myriad of other things from all the EDs.  Although we had our differences in opinion about what should go where, we eventually came to our conclusions as you will see below.\n\nWe believe that this list has the best of what 2019’s EDs have to offer, and we hope that you enjoy it.",

          "writeup": "Wasa Wasa Wasa is visually and musically a cut above most of the ED category this year. The usage of felt-crafts to make the characters is quite uncommon and the stop-motion animation is incredibly clever in its transitions. The dancing looks really nice overall, and the synchronization throughout the ED is fantastic between the music and visuals. Due to the inherent limitations of stop-motion, the choreography is relatively simplistic, but the jury thought this gave it more character overall. The faces the characters make are very expressive and emotive, thus giving more impact to each scene in the ED. The friendship of Makoto and Gonjirou is shown throughout with their antics as they explore this weird world. Their environment is almost like a dream-state which matches the music due to its calming and catchy beat with nice bass extension. The lyrics are also very relevant as they match the visuals and his voice matches the music quite well. “The knitting wool that was delivered, won’t come undone!” at the beginning of the ED as Gonjirou twirls on screen is just one of many examples.\n\nThe jury felt that this ED was one of the best of the year due to it being fun to watch, visually exciting and unique, as well as having a catchy song. Overall this was voted as the second best ED of the year, just barely losing out to Stand by Me.",

          "writeup": "The second of 4 EDs that *Beastars* employed, Nemureru Honoo has a deep connection and an impressive thematic attachment to its show. While some felt that it leaned a bit too hard into the more distasteful parts of the show, the majority of the jury felt that Nemureru’s thematic relation to Legosi’s conflicted instinctual battle between love and hunger fit the show perfectly, and was well used as a tagline to specific episodes in order to further enhance that tone. Legosi’s struggle is artfully presented visually through a growing red color scheme throughout the ED, along with thematic tie-ins from the blood moon, Legosi’s aggressive shadows, and a walk cycle through the outstretched and grasping hands of desire, which increase the tension and unease both Legosi and the audience feel.  All of these elements are wonderfully tied together into a stage aesthetic, made clear with distinct cardboard backgrounds and opening curtain, which connect back nicely to *Beastars* theatrical style and Legosi’s participation in the drama club.\n\nThe song, however, was where the jury really divided.  While some appreciated the dichotomy between the sinister undercurrent of the song and Yurika’s sweet, yet seductive vocal performance, others found the song too upbeat, or took issue with the disturbing nature of the lyrics. Additionally, there were specific moments where it felt poorly utilized, such as the transition to the chorus during Legosi’s walk cycle, which felt jarring and out of place. This only emphasized the feeling that the walk cycle was overlong and slowed the pace of the ED down too much.\n\nAll in all, while the remarkable thematic drive and intriguing musical performance make Nemureru Honoo one of the best EDs of the year, its divisive nature lead to the jury ranking it 8th.",

However, the jury felt that it stood out amongst not only Precure ending themes, but amongst ending themes in general this year due to its carefully coordinated color usage and dance choreography, along with fantastic aesthetic sensibilities. The aesthetic choice of vaporwave backgrounds fits in with the space-bound setting of *Star Twinkle Precure* perfectly. The ED sticks with this theme throughout, depicting retro cityscapes, the unique vaporwave color palette, and even palm trees!\n In addition to this, the jury felt that the ED being CGI justifies itself by keeping the choreography simple but extremely detailed with each of the girls' outfits and minor movements (such as their hair). This is further backed with some excellent shot composition and stellar use of cinematography to come together as a cohesive and fun ending theme.\nThat being said, some of the jurors felt as though Oshiete...! Twinkle lacked notable context for the show and its characters outside of Cure Cosmo's introduction. In addition to this, some felt that the song and the vaporwave aesthetic were a tad mismatched with the song being a bit too bubbly for traditional vaporwave backgrounds.",

Obvious differences such as the gulf of athleticism between Muroi-sensei and the hapless Sakurai-sensei, the desk-bound Mitsue’s utter lack of coordination, or the enthusiasm of the otaku Shingo’s idol dance initially grabbed our attention. Nevertheless, what really sealed the deal for the jury was the portrayal of subtle details like the slight lack of synchronization between Maki and Toma, which is slowly exacerbated as the aloof Maki loses interest in the routine while the workaholic Toma dances himself to exhaustion. Also a special shout out to the president for the majestic confidence exuded in her routine.\n\nOf course, to address the elephant in the room, the controversy with the reference footage did bring apprehension to the jury, but the studio’s sincere efforts to contact and credit the original choreographers largely abated these anxieties. Finally, the energetic song with its motivational but trite lyrics provided a good enough accompaniment to the visuals for this ED to soar as high as third place in our rankings.",

          "writeup": "Sayonara Gokko, the first ED for the 2019 retelling of Osamu Tezuka’s *Dororo*, is a melancholic mood piece with a beautifully animated charcoal-like aesthetic. What this ED doesn’t have in narrative structure, it more than makes up for with its style and tone.\n\nVisually distinct from the show itself, this ED showcases the strengths of artist and animator Osamu Kobayashi, most well-known for directing the mid-2000s classics *BECK* and *Paradise Kiss*. His talent for portraying intimate human expressions is magnified with every small gesture of charming character animation. Implementing a more muted color palette allows vivid accents to truly shine, such as the sudden splatter of a demon’s blood. Seemingly unimportant vignettes, such as softly falling petals or a warm burning flame, feel tangible despite their minimalism, and perfectly suit a show all about regaining and discovering sensory experiences. This “snapshots-in-time” approach, backed by an appropriately melancholic song, creates an almost dream-like atmosphere from our two leads’ point of view.\n\nAll that being said, the jury did have some issues with this ED. Fade transitions were heavily overused in an effort to create the illusion of blinking, and while it did succeed at creating said illusion, that overuse made an interesting concept seem repetitive and boring. The most common criticism was the inclusion of two lingering still shots of Dororo and Hyakkimaru right as the chorus hit, which brutally disrupted the flow of the ED in the eyes of the jury.\n\nWhile not at the top of the list, Sayonara Gokko makes full use of its stunning art style, packs a ton of emotion sans any concrete narrative, and handily deserves its placement as one of the top ten EDs of 2019.",

These elements work together to create an ED with visuals that match the energy of the song at any given time. The more folksy intro is accompanied by rural backgrounds, and the intensity of the chorus is matched by the ocean’s roaring waves. There is also a harmony between the lyrics and the visuals; “I’m missing you” lines up with Thors’ silhouette blurring, and “未開の海に 海路を照らす願い” (I pray that you light the way through uncharted seas) lines up with the sun shining across the ocean.\nWhile the jury appreciated these aspects, they took issue with others. The jury felt that while the backgrounds may have been pleasant, a large number of panning landscape shots made the ED feel underwhelming. In addition, most of the character artwork feels distinctly out of place in its environments due to the large difference in shading and lighting. The same can be said for the CG boat models, which look like they come from as different a plane of reality as the ocean they sail on. Finally, while the jury appreciated the tone at first, that changed after the show’s timeskip. The overall tone of the song and visuals felt at odds with Thorfinn’s angst and desire for revenge. As such, it sank to 10th place.",

          "writeup": "*Vinland Saga’s* second ED, Drown, depicts the cycle of violence that the show’s Danish and English soldiers engage in at the behest of their religious ideals: honor, glory, and the afterlife. The song, performed by milet, doubles down on the idea that these soldiers are drowning in a turbulent sea of their own creation, and only the heavenly Valkyries, extending their hands towards a lone warrior standing atop a mountain of corpses, offer any chance of salvation. This imagery perfectly complements realizations by Canute and Askeladd in the show’s second half that there must exist a better philosophy of life, outside of the Norse and Christian ideologies that have led to so much unnecessary destruction.\n\nThe visual aesthetic’s sepia tone evokes the historical nature of the show, and its mythical combatants. However, many jurors felt that the usage of a grainy filter was employed heavy-handedly in an attempt to obscure reused footage from the show, generally low frame rate animation, and rather poor CGI implementation in certain cuts. While the transition where Thorfinn plunges his short swords into the bottom of the frame was well received, the rest of the ED generally lacked good transitions or synchronization between action and music. For these various reasons, Drown finished 9th in ED, behind stiff competition.",

          "writeup": "Landing itself amongst the middle of the pack, due to easily being the most divisive nominated ED for the jury this year, Veil brings a lot to discuss with it. The song by Keina Suda - that’s somehow equal parts catchy and melancholic - works as a great backing track to Iris reflecting on the horrors of her past life and the friends she lost along the way. The lyrics tell a story about the struggles of moving on, and reminiscing about unreachable memories in a song that many jurors consider one of the best songs of the year. It is matched excellently by the visuals that match the shifting tone and emotional weight of the song well. \n\nThe imagery of a young Iris surrounded by burnt bodies immediately sets the scene for the ED. As we burst through the happy memories a young Iris made, they are immediately juxtaposed with the horrors that destroyed them as a now older Iris reflects on the past. The rustic visual style used with Taiko Konno’s detailed linework and stylistic fire animation grabs the eye. This is backed up by animation that to some jurors felt stuttery in parts, but many others praised for the expressiveness of the silhouette run or the attention to detail in the water pouring scene. The use of stills in the early parts was a slight downfall for the ED, especially the way they don’t match the beat of the song. \n\nLastly, a small handful of jurors considered the sexualization of Iris in the bathing sequence to undercut the narrative of the ED slightly. However, most jurors still agreed that despite some imperfections here and there Veil still makes for an ED that presents a powerful narrative with great aesthetic and structure, tied together by a memorable song.",

          "writeup": "In a dominant performance, *Sarazanmai’s* Stand By Me struck a chord with the jury due to its outstanding concept and execution. The mixed media approach received considerable praise - the aesthetic was striking, the implementation seamless.  While some jurors took issue with the stillness of the characters, many remarked how well-integrated they felt with the real-life background. The spellbinding light effects, in addition to being synchronized to the song superbly, aided here, providing motion and visual direction in lieu of more traditional animation. Both the characters and effects had considerable thought in integration, appearing in reflections and casting appropriate shadows that hammer home the meticulous effort that went into this ending.\nThe mixed media was regarded as a vehicle for the show’s themes – while well-integrated, the characters still appeared offset from their environment, giving an isolated feel, developing the theme of connections.  The use of mixed media also gave character to the world of Asakusa by showing real-world counterparts – many of which (such as the kappa statue, soccer spot, and bridge) were motifs leveraged in the show to develop its theme.\nThe song itself also drew near-unanimous praise from the jury – particular praise was given to the distorted guitar intro – which served wonderfully as a segue from the show – and the delivery of the lyrics, which was appropriately anguished  to capture the mood of the lyrics.\nAn Easter Egg that served as a cherry on top of an already well-constructed ending was that the locations used, when plotted from above, form the ア symbol that appears throughout the show. What made this ending so special was that, on top of the demonstrated competence in production and direction, there was an absurd attention to detail, and little details like this really emphasize this aspect that made Stand By Me stand out.",

Featuring the lovable Chika Fujiwara in a cute and catchy character song and dance combo, this ED overflowed with personality and charm. With smooth rotoscoping work done by Naoya Nakayama, this ED certainly caught the eyes of the public and the jury alike. \n\nThe jury unanimously applauded the stunning rotoscoping and choreography of Chika’s dance, and most also enjoyed all of the love put into stuffing the choreo full of Chika’s bubbly personality. The animation is smooth and flows nicely throughout the ED, and the music complements the dance really well. in the lyrics of the song such as the 3 IQ gag, which perfectly complemented the choreographer's attempts to recreate panels and covers for the manga.\n\nWith all that said, some of the jury had reservations about certain aspects of the ED. Some thought that the ED would’ve been better placed at the end of the next episode featuring detective Chika to fit more in the context of the show, which detracted from the ED’s enjoyment a bit. The jury also had mixed opinions about the camerawork; some said that the framing cut out the charming footwork in the dance, while others praised Chika Chika for its amateur-ish camera sways that add to the charm of the ED. \n\nThe overall execution of Chikatto Chika Chika was great, earning it a solid 4th place in the jury rankings due to tough competition.",

Yuuki Ono was able to project the extremely charismatic and confident persona of Louis, a popular student at the Cherryton Academy (and it’s easy to see why he’s popular). The role is an interesting one because it is a layered performance where Louis tries to meet expectations by maintaining the outward assurance of a leader while suppressing his inward fear and frustrations of being an herbivore. As the show progresses, we see his confidence peeled back to reveal many internal struggles with doing what’s expected (such as not going after Haru during her kidnapping), and this is presented very well by Ono. Yuuki Ono shows the audience a sense of deep conflict within Louis that unravels over the course of the show. It finally culminates with Louis unleashing a fervent, impulsive attack on the Shishigumi that is backed by the manic energy of Ono’s performance. At the end of the anime, Yuuki Ono leaves a lasting impression with his performance of a deer who has rejected and broken free of the expectations that had chained him down for most of his life. \n\n",

The jury felt that Kensho Ono was able to convey Giorno Giovanna’s personality very well through his performance of a Jojo with an unwavering, intense focus who is able to stay cool-headed among the relentless cutthroat battles of GANGSTARS. Kensho Ono uses a very smooth and soothing voice as Giorno to help reassure the audience he is in control of the situation and always figures out a path to victory.  Because Giorno is usually so level-headed, it stands out all the more prominently whenever Ono’s performance loses its calm, whether due to grief at losing precious allies or unleashing frenzied attacks on enemies. Though Giorno was a very solid performance, the jury felt that it was difficult for him to consistently stand out above the rest of the strong and well-acted cast. His shining moment definitely comes through in arguably one of the most famous scenes in the anime, the 7 page emotion-packed *”MUDAMUDAMUDA”* and *”WRYYYYYYY”* that was a show of impressive lung capacity indeed. Overall, the jury appreciated Kensho Ono’s depiction of Giorno and felt he was able to do a capable job as the main character of *Golden Wind*. ",

In all seriousness here, it takes a lot of talent to so convincingly and consistently render a ringing phone's onomatopoeia, namely about as much as that required for a seven-page long MUDA! That said, Souma Saitou's performance as Doppio in *Golden Wind* demonstrates fully the duality of his character. Souma is able to easily transition from a goofy crime syndicate underling bumbling about through life to a dangerously unhinged, paranoid schizophrenic mastermind. Thus, one might say that Saitou was the perfect personification of the first track of King Crimson's In the Court of the Crimson King Album, or at the very least the Epitaph. (your mileage, e.g. subs, may vary) The jurors were impressed at how capable he was at pulling off this character with amazing and comedic over-reactions and a dual nature, as well as with his excellent use of meme-tier vocal sound effects, Souma Saitou's fascinating performance as Golden Wind's Doppio is, to paraphrase Battle Tendency, 'Naisu, Naisu!

Shirogane, voiced by Makoto Furukawa, was one of the show’s main leads and did not disappoint in any of the episodes. Furukawa takes on the role of a conflicted high school student, who must battle with both Kaguya in mind games and with society in upholding the persona of a “perfect, model student.” His ability to flip between his frantic internal monologue and his composed external dialogue impressed the jury, as well as his delivery during conversations with Kaguya and Chika.\n\nWhile Furukawa delivered a solid performance as Shirogane this year, some on the jury felt that the show didn’t allow him to flex his full acting ability, as his most dramatic lines were only for a short while near the end of the series. We also felt that Furukawa was overshadowed a tad bit by Kaguya and Chika’s acting abilities, as they had more chances to show their full vocal range.\n\nOverall, Makoto Furukawa delivered an outstanding performance this year, being able to fulfill his role as Miyuki Shirogane while even enhancing the source material in some aspects. His lines worked in perfect harmony with the amazingly excessive animation of the show, and his excellent shifting between internal and external speech secured him a proper spot as a nominee this year.\n",

More than the con man that we saw in the previous season, Reigen has greater moments of sincerity, and the consequences of his actions are given more focus. Takahiro still brings the strong charisma and confidence necessary to create the always entertaining con man, with subtle nuances to make it clear when he’s conning someone. This performance is essential for landing Reigen’s more comedic moments and makes him always engaging to listen to.\n\nHowever, what elevates this season past the first one is how Sakurai handles the more character-oriented events that Reigen undergoes. The power of his emotions shines through during these segments and gives a life to these moments that are essential for making his character seem authentic. Sakurai crafts a depiction of a Reigen that feels filled with desperation and isolation, a Reigen who is placed in a situation that is unfamiliar to him, a Reigen that is forced to go on an emotional journey. Sakurai’s nuanced portrayal sells us on these feelings and makes Reigen’s feelings believable and real. More than anything, we hear Reigen’s evolution throughout these scenes brought to life thanks to Takahiro Sakurai’s brilliant performance.  This year had a lot of strong performances, but Takahiro Sakurai’s take on Reigen Arataka stands out and lands at a very strong third place in this category.\n",

For this reason, we needed the same level of complexity from Askeladd's voice acting performance. One of the most well-known voice actors from the industry, Naoya Uchida manages to capture the very soul of Askeladd, and this is reflected in his performance. To achieve this, Naoya uses many different voice ranges. In one moment we hear his serious tone and how threatening it is. In another moment his snarky tone eases the tone of the scene he is in. Such a diverse voice range helps the immersion and lets us empathize with the character.\n\nAskeladd’s definitive vocal performances appeared in episode 22 and 23. Even without those two episodes, Naoya gave a strong performance throughout the season. However, these two episodes elevated his performance to another level. The sheer amount of emotions behind those scenes were like nothing we have seen before in 2019. At that point, rather than acting, Naoya became the character, and this was a fascinating experience. Naoya’s fantastic performance was really close to matching Legosi’s performance, but fell a bit short of it in terms of nuanced character acting. Still, we highly enjoyed his voice acting and he hits a well deserved second place on our ranking.\n",

This year had some great male performances, but despite his role as a shy, awkward teenage wolf, Kobayashi as the *Beastars* MC still won out. *Beastars* was a show that featured strong performances from its entire cast, which may have resulted from their novel recording method in which they physically acted out their scenes like a theater play. Despite this, Legosi was still able to stand out among the rest of the cast. Having the cast act out their roles added a lot and through Kobayashi's performance you are able to tell a lot about Legosi through his voice alone.\n\nA “portrayal of a sheep in wolf’s clothing” is a saying that initially seems to fit this character perfectly. In the beginning, Kobayashi plays a timid and awkward wolf, who acts friendly and kind in order to be more approachable. Legosi tries very hard to ACT like this because he knows that carnivores are feared by the herbivores in their society. However, his “WILD SIDE” still loomed underneath. The jurors felt that this act of balancing these drastically two different sides was performed exemplarily by Kobayashi.\n\nKobayashi's performance shined the most whenever Legosi was interacting with Haru, as the awkwardness jumped up to an 11 and so did his wild nature that he struggled to control. Despite being a newcomer to the voice acting scene, this being only his second role as a main character, Chikahiro Kobayashi managed to come out on top, and the jury hopes that there will be more great performances by him in the future.\n",

We’ve previously seen his ferocity in action during the ending events of Season 2 when he forced his soldiers to “Susume”. This season also gave us glimpses into Erwin’s more contemplative side. Ono had to hold back his usual fiery spirit as he wrestled the delicate balance between the survival of the Survey Corps under his command versus giving up on his dreams. This culminated in one of the most ironically motivational speeches of the year, where he convinced over 100 soldiers to forfeit their lives in the slim chance that it would allow Levi to best the Beast Titan. The raw power in his voice when he shouted his famous line “Scream my soldiers, Rage my Soldiers” was spine-chilling.\n\nHowever, Ono’s performance was a bit more limited than what was preferable. Outside of his definitive moments, the story didn’t offer him as much room to explore Erwin’s character and make it more of his own. Daisuke’s definitive moments were great, but his more normal moments were calmer and in tone with his usual performance as Erwin.\n\nThe jury greatly appreciated how defining Daisuke’s critical moments were and how they stood out this year, but his performance needed an extra push to elevate it to the same level as our top 3 this year.

Most jurors agreed that while her work on Mao was no less skillful or impactful within the show, it ended up bearing too much resemblance to previous work by Kuno and never gave her a chance to shine in ways the jury knew she could pull off. She never breaks out of Mao's initially established vocal archetype, and when compared against similar characters from other works, there's too little to set her apart.

For those that are still in doubt, Fairouz brought a great deal of charm and excitement to her role as the genki gyaru gym-goer, as well as stealing every scene, which was no small feat given she was up against veterans such as Sora Amamiya, Nao Touyama, and of course Yui Horie. That being said, Fairouz also took the opportunity to demonstrate her wide vocal range, talent for comedic overreaction, and of course, a great deal of chemistry with her fellow seiyuus. To top it all off, she has a lovely singing voice as well, which further showcased her sheer level of talent and promise. And just to demonstrate that her debut role was no mere fluke, Ai Fairouz got to show off her gruff and badass side (with of course a good deal of comedy thrown in) with *Cautious Hero* 's Valkyrie, and she's even landed a VA gig with the *F/GO* gacha game. As such, Ai Fairouz is not just the best rookie seiyuu of the year but also one of the top Female VA’s of the year too.",

However, she really shined through the more ominous and dark moments of the show. Emma’s dark and cold way of questioning and fighting against everything she’d ever known was given due justice thanks to Morohoshi’s performance. That said, the jury felt it was otherwise lacking compared to the other nominees. It is unfortunate that Morohoshi was not able to stand out as much as she could have.

She captures the essence of Tanya by bringing out her inner rational salaryman persona while keeping in line with Tanya’s childish tone. On top of this, Aoi Yuuki also captures the militaristic role of Tanya by using tonal clues of a military commander, resulting in a very unique performance.\n\nThese distinct roles allow Aoi Yuuki to flex her wide vocal range. For example, while talking to her superiors, you can feel the subtle narcissism in her voice. In another scene where everything goes according to her plan, she lets out a maniacal laugh. In her monologues, she brings out the stoic voice of her past self. \n\nUltimately, Aoi Yuuki captures different aspects of voice acting and blends them perfectly, thus setting a new standard for the voice acting industry. However, some of us felt that her performance in the movie was a step down compared to the anime. Nonetheless, she secures a respectable 2nd place, only narrowly losing out to Aoi Koga’s Kaguya.",

Konomi Kohara really nails the air-headedness of Fujiwara’s character by tapping into these sounds. Her rapping in the word game skit is phenomenal and Kohara’s performance really elevates the comedic value of the moment.\n\nUnfortunately, the biggest drawback of Kohara’s performance is her lack of range.

With an emotive, creative, and enjoyable performance, Kohara takes us on a journey through the chaotic and fun-filled life of Shadow Mistress Yuuko - or Shamiko for short.\n\nOn the surface, Kohara’s performance as Shamiko appears to be ordinary, plain and generic which is par for the course in these types of roles. But on closer examination of her voice work, Kohara actually flexes a considerable range for Shamiko, rarely crutching on cute sounds and opting instead for lots of guttural groans and screeches that bring a real, raw emotion to her role. Additionally, the tempo of her delivery is fast-paced, creating a flow in dialogue that accentuates the comedy and sucks listeners into the conversation. Kohara’s acting is amazing throughout, but a great highlight is when Yuuko returns to her body at the health spa, demonstrating all the key elements of what makes Shamiko a compelling performance. \n\nThe criticisms aimed at Shamiko largely fall on the show itself; for some, the show was weird, disorienting, and awkward, and since Shamiko is the main character and driving force of the show, it reflects poorly on her performance as well. Some felt that her performance was a bit generic and felt that Kohara didn’t have a lot of diversity in her dialogue delivery.\n\nWhile *Machikado Mazoku* was somewhat of a sleeper anime this past year, it received critical acclaim in many circles, and a lot of its success is due to the incredible showing that Kohara had as Shamiko. And while she may not have ranked that high on this jury’s list, Yoshida Yuuko will be sure to remind the other competitors: “Don’t think this means you’ve won!”",

If the public had not nominated her, the jury would have instead.\n\n*Cautious Hero: The Hero is Overpowered but Overly Cautious*, which aired in the Fall 2019 season, looks like a drop in the ocean of isekai anime that have aired in recent years. Many people initially wrote off the anime as being a slight variant of literally every other isekai anime, and elected to skip it. Those who did stick around were in for a treat that was Ristarte’s voice acting by Aki Toyosaki. \n\nThe voice acting for this show isn’t bad, but Toyosaki puts it over the top with extravagant delivery of her lines, working in perfect harmony with the *Kill la Kill*-esque animation style and facial expressions of her character. Nonetheless, some on the jury disliked her overly energetic and exaggerated performance, as those were the only kinds of lines Toyosaki had spoken for most of the show’s runtime.\n\nNear the end of the series, Toyosaki highlighted the calmer and more nuanced side of her vocal range with some of her best lines in the series. Impressively enough, Toyosaki was able to change the atmosphere of an entire episode through just a few pieces of dialogue.\n\nOverall, Aki Toyosaki as Ristarte was a spectacular performance of 2019 that kept viewers coming back each week for more. Throughout the series, she was able to deliver, and every member of the jury appreciated some part of her acting. This made Aki Toyosaki one of the top performances of the year, and a well deserved nomination.",

While Fujiwara’s character stole the hearts of the jury, there was no doubt that Aoi Koga's performance was the best in the show. Everyone in the jury was blown away by how easily Aoi Koga was able to seamlessly transition between Kaguya’s various emotions and tones, be it maniacal, panicked, full-blown idiotic or more. Sometimes these vocal changes would happen in the span of just a single scene! It was incredible to watch Aoi Koga portray the different facets of her character with relative ease. Her contrasting vocals matched the contrasting emotions of her character, which allowed the audience to view Kaguya as either a deranged psychopath or just a lovestruck and innocent high-school girl, all with the power of a single line of dialogue. There was particular praise for her performance in episode 9, when Kaguya got sick. Not only was it hilarious to watch Kaguya herself become a completely different person, but it was amazing to hear Aoi Koga pull off that change without any hint of a struggle. Truth be told, the jury expected it would come down to a battle between the two Aoi’s, and Aoi Koga emerged victorious from that battle. Her versatility and range would be nothing without her passion, and we are very excited to watch whatever else Aoi Koga might do in the future.",

Yamazaki Haruka brings this idea to life with energy, sporting an inquisitive and naive tone that gives Haru a slightly non-human feel to her talking. However, Haru is anthropomorphized in many ways as well, and one interesting aspect is her role as an older sister. During a reunion with her younger cat brother Hachi, Haru goes through various “roles” as she balances being a confident older sister and a relatively greenhorn pet.

In the end, this rise was just enough to barely overtake *Golden Kamuy* in a close final vote, and allowed it to take home the top spot in an extremely competitive year for the category.",

There is a notable high quality in Kenichiro's use of instruments and how they’re layered to create different compositions, combined with strong motifs that resonate with their visual backing.\n\nThe OST does a great job of splitting the tone between action tracks and more atmospheric pieces, including a liberal use of Ainu instruments that help portray the pacifistic nature of the Ainu people and their acceptance of others. The track “Kamuy Mosir'' does well in portraying this strength that Kenichiro juxtaposes, with its calm and tranquil use of flute and xylophone to amplify the peacefulness of a lunch gathering among two conflicting groups. Then there’s “Killer Orca'' set during the story’s climax that utilizes the frantic plucking of violins, bass guitar, and steel guitar, combined with chanting and a strong use of brass instruments and drums. This particular track creates a bombastic and chaotic piece that mixes very well; elevating one of the most memorable scenes in the show.\n\nOne of the most defining pieces is “Blue Eyes”, which features a melancholic Tonkori and ethereal usage of vocals to create a dreary and foreboding atmosphere. This lines up perfectly in usage with revelations of Asirpa’s father and connections to both Nopperabo and the Ainu treasure.\n\nA minor weakness corresponds to a few action themes that don’t stand out quite as much in context compared to a solo listen or even some quieter tracks. In such a tightly competitive year as this one, *Golden Kamuy’s* starkly different/excellent atmosphere is decisive in its strong second place finish.",

Unfortunately, as well equipped as it is, it's not always well utilized. Some tracks are jarringly incongruous to the scenes they're trying to score, while more scenes than normal don’t get music at all.

The winning choice needed a solid structure with multiple strong points of appeal, and Yuki Hayashi’s soundtrack for *Run With The Wind* fully delivers on those aforementioned beats.\n\nOne point of appeal is its main theme and its variations, a solid two part piece transitioning from meandering rhythms, which represent Haiji’s struggle in learning the meaning of running, into a consistent and strong airy beat that portrays Kakeru’s struggle at being strong in long distance running.\n\nAnother point would be its varied instrumentation connected to minor consistent themes that tie into the story’s three paces. There’s the calm one, with tracks about the struggles of the dorm in their daily life, characterized with acoustic guitar/banjo. Then there is the more high-tempo one, with tracks about the running itself, mostly liquid DnB characteristic of sports montages, with a neutral tone. And finally the third high-note one, expressing the motivation and inspiration of the run, punctuated with vocals and airy rhythms like the tapping piano leitmotif along with inspirational crescendos. There is also a minimalist approach, where it borrows from the previous to cover a dramatic scene.\n\nHowever, its biggest strength would be the way the main theme and the various paces get combined and transitioned in-between. The Hakone Ekiden arc is the capstone of this idea - where the insertion of various instruments and themes weave a masterful soundscape of relief, gratification, or even sorrow. It ties everything together in beautiful moments of clarity as the story answers the questions posed by the two halves of the main theme. \n\nThis whole journey that the music goes through truly elevates this entry above the rest, and as such, deserves the top spot.",

          "writeup": "In a strong year for OST, *Kimetsu no Yaiba* certainly put up a spirited fight amongst the nominees on offer. With Yuki Kajiura creating the main theme and Go Shiina bringing variations of it into the soundscape, this collaboration yielded an ever-evolving soundtrack that strengthened each scene. These motifs and themes allowed a sense of progression to occur while also controlling the tone of the scene, subtly matching the context on screen in great detail.\n\nThe traditional instrumentation was a high-bar for the tone and atmosphere of the show, strengthening certain emotions during a climax. A track like “Kamado Tanjiro no Uta” with its slow build of piano, cello and flute, that bursts forth with a crash of cymbals into more orchestration, served to elevate its scene to new heights. \n\nHowever, with its focus on motifs, there was an over-abundance of them. Being 26 episodes long and with 4 CDs worth of tracks to use, some jurors felt that there was too much motif work and that some of them were too similar in sound and use, so that it often felt like tracks were being re-used. While the more intense and hype tracks really worked well at creating the tone of the show, the more calm and ambient tracks fell by the wayside in this regard, not quite hitting the mark as the former had.\n\nIt's with these criticisms in mind, as well as the strength of the year that handed *Kimetsu no Yaiba* fifth place in these awards.",

          "writeup": "*Attack on Titan* has a new soundtrack for its third season, and once again Hiroyuki Sawano worked his magic to deliver yet another incredibly hype soundtrack.  The OST excelled in bringing out Sawano’s usual strength for composition: dynamic character themes and the grand epic set pieces that comprise its repertoire of battle themes.  Bertolt’s transformation theme “Apple Seed” is an obvious standout, while the bone-chilling “Before Lights Out” was the perfect tone-setter before Erwin’s final stand.  The compositions overall stood out as pushing all the right buttons for an epic soundtrack.  \n\nHowever, the OST wasn’t as strong at emphasizing the quieter moments and their usage wasn’t to the same level as the high octane moments. While the compositions themselves were strong and up to the standard of Sawano’s usual work, they didn’t differentiate themselves enough from his other works to stand out as the sound of *Attack on Titan*, even less so the sound of the third season.  These are minor criticisms, and while the soundtrack overall is a strong one, in a year as strong as this one these criticisms add up and are the ultimate reason for the sixth place finish.",

The titular Carole and Tuesday wish to find success as independent singer-songwriters, but find themselves swept up in the corporate machine. They compete against their natural rival, Angela, whose compositions are written for her by an artificial intelligence expert who is adept at analyzing the most popular trends.\n\nA wide diversity of genres and musical styles were showcased over the course of the anime. The Mars Brightest competition allowed for a wild variety of performance art, some of which was wacky and humorous, such as the curse-ridden anthem of the Mermaid Sisters. However, GGK’s ethereal vocals and OG Bulldog’s unique juxtaposition of hip-hop beats and opera were genuinely impressive. The second half of the show featured the soaring vocals of Desmond and Flora, whose characters represented legendary singers who had grown disillusioned with the music industry. However, no one stood out quite as much as Ezekiel whose fiery raps, composed by Denzel Curry, lent a great deal of authenticity to the political strife which marked the show’s final arc.\n\nWhile the insert songs define the show, the atmospheric backdrop was formed by Mocky’s instrumental soundtrack. The low-fi bluesy beats Mocky employed fit the Mars cityscape well, however these instrumentals faded into the tapestry of the soundscape a bit too much, failing to hold their own in comparison with the insert songs. The jury’s disappointment with the instrumental soundtrack was the main differentiating factor accounting for the OST’s fourth place finish.",

It was an even more difficult task to actually rank what we selected, but this was the conclusion we reached after months of work.\n\nWe first generated a shortlist and the idea behind it was that every juror was encouraged to check out every single show nominated, especially if they were brought up early on. We collected response metrics as soon as enough people checked out the shows that were on the chopping block, and used that to narrow the field.\n\nBy the time we knew our public noms, we had already talked about the jury noms to death. All of us felt strongly about them to some degree or another. Dialogue had only increased once the public nominations came in. However AotY was always at its most active when *Hugtto* or *Symphogear* were the topics discussed. Juror’s opinions were divided and vocal about it, with *Hugtto* specifically in 8 of the jurors top 3 with a few notable dissenters.\n\nOverall, everyone managed to find something from the nominations to get attached to in some way, whether we got it from the public or nominated it ourselves. The fact that each of us felt strongly about a show one way or another is an indication of how seriously we took this. More importantly though, we felt that each of these 10 shows were more than worth talking about, and that’s the mark of a pretty solid AotY list.",

          "writeup": "*Hugtto! Precure* goes about modernizing the standard approach to mahou shoujo themes through the work of visionary director, Junichi Satou, arguably the godfather of modern mahou shoujo. Despite having a rather large main cast of 5, all characters were able to receive valuable development backed by powerful dramatic moments that were able to elevate them to being great characters, most notably Emiru and Ruru. Further, the pertinent social commentary present in this iteration of precure lends itself well to the overall changing landscape of magical girls shows and to society itself with us finally seeing the first male cure (even if only briefly). \n\n\n*Hugtto* takes the time to explore each of its different characters and allows them to be fleshed out via more slice of life episodes. Despite this, *Hugtto* never feels as though it lacks focus, jumping from one fantastic episode to the next, such as the titular mermaid princess episode or the climax of Ruru’s arc, all tied together by the overarching theme of the future.\n\n\nAll of this backed by one of the most stellar productions the Precure franchise has ever seen along with the likes of *Go! Princess Precure* and *Heartcatch Precure*. Featuring prolific veteran animators such as **Masami Mori** and **Kazuhiro Ota**, along with up and coming names like **Koudai Watanabe** and **Itsuki Tsuchigami**.\n\nSimply put, *Hugtto! Precure* excels at everything it sets out to be. It finds itself atop the rankings and is the jury’s Anime of the Year for 2019.",

          "writeup": "*Symphogear XV*, while placing third in the category overall, was undoubtedly the most divisive nominee amongst AotY jurors. It’s very much a “love it or hate it” kind of show, and that was very apparent during discussion and voting.\n\nThe one thing everyone was able to agree on is the show’s stellar production. Between its at times stunning animation and a fantastic soundtrack, XV stands out for the amount of talent and passion that went into sending off the last season of Symphogear with a bang.\n\nOn most other points though, it received mixed reception. Many praised it’s over-the-top high energy formula for its bombasticity and the sheer amount of dumb fun it creates. Detractors meanwhile found it to be more dumb than it is fun. The show suffers with plot coherence issues, and the villains in *XV* are nothing particularly special outside of boasting boob rockets (the jury was quite split on whether boob rockets qualify as a positive).\n\nUltimately, *XV* lives up to everything Symphogear wants to be. It looks and sounds better than Symphogear ever has before without losing sight of the ridiculous action the series is known for. If anything, it amps that aspect up a few notches, as *XV* has more combination attacks and more excessive transformation sequences than any season prior. *Symphogear XV* is a definitive entry in the series that the jury believes stands toe to toe with some of the best shows of 2019.",

The varied cast delivers on the good, varied character interactions which are supported by one of the stronger, more interesting visual presentations of the year. Even among these noms, *Zoku* was a standout entry in terms of it's interesting and engaging visuals, even during long stretches of dialogue. Speaking of, *Zoku’s* whole cast of characters return to unravel the mirror mystery, discuss regrets, and engage in the enjoyable banter. Even after the pretty conclusive ending of Owari 2, *Zoku* still managed to find room to look back on and celebrate the series as a whole.\n\n\nThat said, most agreed that the actual narrative of this entry was fairly weak. The mirror conceit was interesting, but in practicality was just an excuse to deliver on what-if fan service. The fan service can be fun in its own right, but it made for a less meaningful show, especially given the shorter runtime. The final conclusion of the arc also wasn’t as impactful, and was notably more convoluted than necessary. Ultimately, it felt like it left a lot of untapped potential on the table compared to higher placing noms. \n\nThese few fundamental missteps kept it from competing with the higher tier nominations, but overall *Zoku Owarimonogatari* gave a strong showing that definitely earned its 6th place placement.",

Filled with a wide cast of characters each with their own motivations, personalities, and takes on this twisted world between carnivores and herbivores. The show treats us to the different mindsets between predator and prey and how their status in this world affects their mindset despite the relative peace that they are experiencing. The character’s experiences are explored more with the strong usage of different art styles to showcase their inner thoughts and turmoil, strong cinematography, and impressive body language that expresses their thoughts and feelings well. \n\nThe characters are both deep enough to be able to explore the themes of *Beastars* while also being relatable and showcasing the struggles having that sort of mindset can bring. There was a lot of power in bringing these experiences to the front and center and illustrating the pain that goes with them in innovative and meaningful ways.\n\nDespite all of these boons the show’s biggest critique was in the amount of things that it tried to do at once. Several of the jurors felt like the narrative was jumbled and didn’t do enough to make it’s themes and message clear. Other aspects like the cinematography that worked well for some, didn’t work well for others due to how on the nose it was. All said though *Beastars* was able to do a lot with the different elements it introduced and managed to win over many of the jurors giving it a great 4th place for Anime of the Year.\n",

Whether that be Nico's journey of weight-loss, Kurahara overcoming his past or Prince's journey of self-improvement, there existed a story for everyone.\n\n\nHowever that lack division also meant that few felt particularly strongly about the series, with only 2 placing it in their top 3. While the finale was well-regarded, many felt the journey to get there was laced with issues. Pointing out the sluggish pacing through the middle, the questionable realism of the sport’s portrayal in an otherwise grounded character drama. Or how the production itself rarely earned praise, often landing at simply \"acceptable\". Meanwhile, the cast as a whole was found to be hit or miss, some characters such as those above landing strongly, while others such as the Twins or King were felt to be lacking comparatively.\n\n\nWhen all was said and done though, no member of the jury left *Run With the Wind* with a negative experience. Everyone found something to like, even if it wasn't their favorite of the year. And it was that consistency, that wide appeal to such a diverse jury, that earned it this 5th place spot.",

Chika was an absolute delight, and the jury appreciated the show for its visual production as well as an OST that did a great job of highlighting the emotional tone of each scene.\n\nIts 9th place ranking is certainly not an indictment of its success as an adaptation, but rather a reflection of some flaws that, while minor, added up. The main couple were charming for some, and fell flat for others due to the show’s unfortunate tendency to press the reset button on character development at the worst times. Some expressed concern that the show leaned too much on a set formula. Meanwhile the side characters were great at breaking up the repetition for some, and too one-note for others.  These concerns, in some combination or another, resulted in a number of jurors finding that, at best, the show didn’t reach its full potential, and, at worst, it was monotonous.\n\nUltimately, no one disagrees that the show belongs on a list of the best anime of the year, but the mixed reception of various elements of the show, in a strong year for anime, resulted in its relatively low placement on the list\n",

Adapted by the highly esteemed Ufotable, the series quickly rose to popularity with a production most of the jury felt was impressive: particularly its sound design, dynamic fight choreography and incredibly fluid animation. Tanjiro was also a surprisingly refreshing protagonist who showed an impressive amount of empathy whilst also having the willpower to do what needed to be done to save his sister.\n\nUnfortunately the jury felt as though *Yaiba* had enough problems that just couldn’t be ignored and took them out of the experience. Zenitsu in particular was almost universally criticised across the jury due to his unhealthy mindset and treatment of women. Inosuke also received complaints amongst the jury, however some appreciated him more towards the end of the show as he received more development. In combination these two were extremely frustrating to watch, which resulted in grating comedy that was reliant on constant screaming. Another major complaint was the pacing of the narrative, with some feeling as though certain arcs dragged on for way too long.\n\nOverall, the jury felt that *Kimetsu no Yaiba* was a fairly competent battle shonen that accomplished what it set out to do to a strong degree. It did have its problems that held it back from placing higher, however it was definitely deserving of a nomination for one of the greatest shows of 2019.",

          "writeup": "*Vinland Saga* was an incredibly popular show based on an incredibly well-acclaimed manga, and the jury agreed that this was largely justified due to the  characters and themes of the show. Askeladd in particular received near unanimous praise for his uniquely calculating personality and morally gray means of achieving his goals. While Thorfinn's arc was static and grating to some and Canute's abrupt character development in episode 18 hampered his many positive qualities, Askeladd seems to almost take a lead role throughout the season. Still, there was no shortage of fun, complex characters that received less of the spotlight.\n\nThe other great strength of *Vinland Saga* was the incorporation of interesting themes that were integral to the characters and story. The hunger for revenge and the question of whether it can ever be truly satisfied, commentary on the perpetuating nature of violence, and the almost intangible spectre of Thors' ideals make for compelling ideological forces that drive the plot. They are well-suited to the world of the vikings and are complemented by explorations of religious belief. There was some discussion about whether the enthusiastic focus on battle scenes was in line with these themes, but the jury also acknowledged that many of them have yet to be fully realized and will likely be developed further in future seasons.\n\nFrom a production standpoint, the jury was impressed by the excellent background art, as well as the consistent quality of the early and final episodes. However there was a consensus that the show lagged during its middle portions, both in terms of plot and production. People also disliked the use of CG for the boats and large-scale fights. That said, obvious skill and research went into accurately depicting the source material and real world setting. In the end, what placed *Vinland Saga* lower in our ranking was a greater positive consensus on the shows above it.",

          "writeup": "*Mob Psycho 100 II* is a story of the good, the bad, and the not-so-ugly. The good – the first half – received considerable praise from the jury. Nearly every episode was praised at one point or another for its plot or how it tied into the larger narrative of Mob’s coming of age. Particularly poignant was the so-called Reigen arc in episodes six and seven that simultaneously developed Reigan as a character and progressed his relationship with Mob, with many citing it as the crown jewel of an already strong show. \n\n\nThe bad – the second half – was decried almost as much as the first half. While it kept up the signature level of production, the narrative was significantly less compelling for many. Outside of the small bit with Serizawa, jurors cited issues – the villains being uninteresting, the plot unfairly using bait-and-switches to create artificial drama, the fact that Shigeo didn’t so much grow as crystallize his existing ideals – that really undermined the whole package. Some jurors also felt that it was a victim of comparison to the first season, particularly the diminished role of Ritsu.\n\n\nAnd the not-so-ugly - the stellar production throughout, which received universal acclaim from the jury. You name it – animation, choreography, art style, cinematography – the visuals knocked it out of the park and really stepped up to bat when the narrative was lacking, while working in concert with the stronger portions of the narrative to more effectively tell its story. All in all, consistently a show that made the jurors say “Holy shit that mob episode!”\n",

          "writeup": "The second part of *Attack on Titan’s* long-awaited third season finally gave fans of the series answers to long-standing questions about the nature of the world, the origins of titans, and most importantly, what the hell was in Eren’s basement. The first half of part two focused heavily on the conflict between the Scouts and the Beast, Colossal, and Armored Titans, whose epic battle greatly impressed the jury in its sheer scale. Studio Wit’s animation work stood out spectacularly during these fight sequences, although most jurors were disappointed by the lackluster CGI work on the Colossal Titan. These battles were also accompanied by a sweeping and bombastic soundtrack that perfectly matched the emotional heights of the show.\n\nErwin Smith’s tenacious pursuit of knowledge at the expense of his fellow soldiers made for a fascinating character arc to behold. The emotional conflict that Erwin felt over figuratively standing on “a mountain of corpses” to reach his goals, added a great deal of nuance to Levi’s judgment on whether to pin humanity’s future hopes on either Erwin or the younger, more unproven, Armin.\n\nAfter unlocking the basement, the narrative focused on the various revelations of the history of titans, the origins of the Eldian people, and the racial and political divide which led the people within the walls to their current fate. While several jurors found the newly uncovered backstory to be immensely satisfying, others found the over-reliance on exposition and explanation to be distasteful. The dull color palette and relatively drab animation outside of fight scenes made for a less engaging presentation during the final part of the season, as well. \n",

After examining everything from TV productions to smaller, independent projects, the jury found we had more potential nominees than we knew what to do with. *Totsukuni no Shoujo* and *Anklet to Aoi Umi* gained juror favor quickly, but the remaining spots were hotly contested and many equally impressive shorts were regrettably unable to make the cut. Once the public nominees were thrown into the mix, the debate only grew fiercer. Questions of whether production should be valued over the narrative, or what exactly to make of the experience that is *Miru Tights*, made for a contentious final ranking that could have gone any number of ways. Nevertheless, we the jury can say with confidence that despite any misgivings we may individually have about the exact order, these eight shows exemplify how much there is to love about the world of short-form anime.",

          "writeup": "Made by three art students, this obscure piece secured the second-place slot through sheer aesthetic skill. It is a work that a budding animator would do well to study unreal concern for detail. Tactility is paid much careful attention, from the hatching of wood to the strokes on clouds. This nuance crafts an attractive pan-Asian islander style that appealed to many jurors. Its character animation brims with charming body language, utilizing the entire human figure to communicate feelings. The linework is some of the finest in animation, used to texture every object and outline emotions. This was especially clear in spicy character close-ups overflowing with detail. Most notable is the water itself, as waves are animated with both fluidity and ferocity. Each surge of the sea carries weight. Gargantuan tides dominate the modest boat. And the linework makes currents look sharp and jagged, resembling the teeth of a rabid beast foaming with hunger.\n\nDespite its artistic strengths, the short could not quite take first. Although expected from a student film, the amateurish voice acting was avoidable, since none of the dialogue added anything meaningful. To add, the narrative’s straightforwardness, while cute, may turn off story-oriented audiences. These issues aside, the unmitigated visual competence of this tiny inexperienced team gained *Anklet to Aoi Umi* the distinguished number two spot.",

With his music video for *Bokura Mada Underground*, he teams up with Wit Studio to present another strong effort. The most striking feature of *BMU* in the eyes of the jury is its visuals, vibrant and detailed throughout. The contrasting worlds portrayed are intricate and lush while having distinctive color palettes and aesthetics that allow each to shine through in their own right. Some jurors did feel that the visuals might have been a bit too busy and overwhelming, but the majority felt that the animation and visual choices were among the strongest of any nominee this year.\n\nThe sync between the lyrics and visuals allowed the video to present multiple possible narratives in a highly abstracted way, giving the viewer the ability to pursue a specific narrative based on their own personal interpretation of the lyrics. While most jurors considered this to be a strength, a few felt that it made the video's narrative unfocused or needlessly unclear. This lack of clarity surrounding the narrative made some jurors skeptical that a coherent narrative even existed.\nIn the end, the complex visuals and highly abstracted narrative proved to be both a strength and a weakness for *Bokura Mada Underground*, with differing opinions among the jurors on these aspects keeping it behind the top two in the category but propelling it to a third-place finish in an extremely tight race.",

In particular, many jurors lauded its creative use of varied color schemes to keep the visuals fresh and engaging. The strong complementary highlights provide clear focal points to guide the viewer’s eye through every shot, and the constant shifts from warm to cold palettes supply some much needed aesthetic diversity. The fight scenes were fluid and overall a blast to watch with their explosive sakuga and unique, surreal dreamscapes. With all of this on top of clean background art and slick androgynous character design, *Raison d'Etre* stands to be one of the strongest nominations this year in terms of art style.\n\nNarrative-wise, there was a clear story to be told of inner struggle being personified through the protagonist battling their doppelganger. Regardless, there were several jurors that felt like the repetitive nature of the short, however intentional, hurt its ability to tell a compelling story and make full use of its runtime. They felt as though there were too many similarities between each loop for it to have the complexity needed to push it into the upper echelon of nominations. Despite these issues, *Raison d’Etre* has established itself as a visually strong short with a resonant albeit simple message, earning it the jury’s pick for 4th place among this year’s nominations.",

          "writeup": "Despite its short 10 minute runtime, *Totsukuni no Shoujo* has enough going for it that it should be discussed as one of the best anime of the year.  The sound direction in *Totsukuni no Shoujo* is absolutely superb, as the sounds of the world manage to completely immerse the viewer into the world as well as convey emotion. It is also a visual treat - with nuance enough to convey character dynamics and its core thematic message just through its color design and shot composition. This is paired with excellent character acting shown through the care in its animation to create an anime that looks gorgeous from start to finish.\n\nEven with a relatively banal slice-of-life plot, or maybe even because of it, the story told is a compelling one. The everyday life of a demon and a little girl serves as the perfect canvas to explore their unique dynamic.  By choosing to jump right into their day-to-day without expositing the mechanics of the world, more time could be spent exploring what makes each of these characters tick. The short truly illustrates the complex wants and fears that each of the characters have to great effect.  The harsh realities of their world may drive many of their fears, but that their loving relationship exists in spite of their world makes for a very emotionally poignant narrative. The combination of stellar production values and endearing characters made *Totsukuni no Shoujo* the short of the year.",

          "writeup": "The second season of *Aggressive Retsuko* continued the franchise’s ability to raise criticism towards the pressure society puts on working adults through its strong wit and sharp commentary. We felt that the second season broadly matched the level of quality of the first season overall, but that the quality of its commentary and narrative fluctuated between the two broad arcs of the second season. The early introduction of Anai and the changes he brought to the show felt too extreme to be relatable. While the effect this had on previously under-developed characters like Kabe or the Director was appreciated, due to its extreme approach the character himself became too irredeemable and the nuance of its commentary was lost.\n\nOn the other hand, we praised *Aggretsuko 2*’s approach to work-life balance and relationships. In some aspects, the poignant narrative relating to Retsuko’s love life and her worries about early adulthood came to its strongest point during this season. Recognizable topics including partner choices, the subject of marriage, and two people having different perspectives on the future of their relationship come up and are addressed with care and attention. Many aspects of Retsuko’s relationship in Season 2 played into this narrative well, but we also felt that the nature of Retsuko’s new partner and the specific complications at play felt arbitrary and created a conflict that wasn’t always relatable or made sense in the larger narrative. \n\nAll things considered, the second season of *Aggretsuko* does a good job of continuing the humor, charm, and narrative of the first season, but much like the first season isn’t entirely without issue.",

          "writeup": "Fetish shows are a difficult bunch when it comes to the judging. The target audience is fairly niche and that audience has assumptions that wouldn’t necessarily fit the average viewer, such as the idea of “erotic scenarios” and tolerance for leering. Not accounting for that factor, the jury was mixed on its matter-of-fact presentation.\n\nSome members of the jury liked the low-tone, scenario-based narrative of the series, while others pointed out that the lack of unique characterization and character design put them off to a large degree. Thoughts on the show’s cinematography were mixed, with positive mentions centering around the shorts themselves, and negative ones around the shot-to-shot editing. However, the biggest complaint was that it didn’t try to have an appeal beyond its erotic shots - meaning that people not necessarily into the fetish don’t have much room to ground themselves comfortably, especially when some of the erotic scenarios can get a bit problematic. However, for the few from the jury that did enjoy it fully, most of the praise was about the variety of scenarios and its low-tone, iyashikei-style humor (and of course the tights themselves). \n\nIn short, while *Miru Tights* has fairly little for people who are seeking material outside of the tights fetish, the audience that would enjoy a show primarily driven around the “enjoy those almost-real tights” would definitely be serviced by it, and as such, it belongs in this top 8.",

The main character, Nanako, is mute and communicates entirely through senryuu, a form of haiku focusing on human nature. While this concept was interesting and quirky for some jury members, others thought that it was too gimmicky and eventually tiresome after a couple of episodes. The jury was also split on what to think about the supporting cast, with one side saying that they added comedic relief to keep the show fresh and vibrant, while the remainder thought that they were one-dimensional and thus uninteresting. Still, Nanako’s dynamic with Eiji was a positive point for all of us. Eiji counterbalances her well due to him being a loud, misunderstood youth while she is a kind, shy, and sweet girl. Personality-wise, they are yin and yang - but they worked well together, got along nicely, and delivered some of the most heartwarming moments of the year.\n\nOverall, the jury was pretty divided on this one. Some of us thought it was an adorable and effective rom-com, whilst others thought the senryuu was a gimmick that didn’t substantially add to the show. Despite not taking home the win, the show’s endearing eccentricity still easily earned it a place among the best shorts of the year.",

Its large roster of already established characters means that minimal set-up is required before it starts riffing on them and telling jokes, and seeing the comparisons between shows as characters contrast against each other can be delightful and amusing. At its worst, it lazily rests on an underdeveloped setting and a bloated roster of characters that struggle to find a proper space within the show.

Thus, while the absurdity of *Isekai Quartet* and its ability to pack in quick, little jokes and make fun of their original settings made it a pleasant surprise for some of the jury, it wasn’t able to provide something substantial enough to get it above its 8th place finish.

The tighter focus allowed Lala and Yuma’s relationship to shine, and Lala’s character development in particular was appreciated. In addition, the movie adopted a slower pace than the show, which gave the OST and visuals extra impact. This was especially noticeable in standout scenes like the trio exploring the world and singing under the stars. \n\nOn the other hand, many thought the movie stumbled in its narrative. The bounty hunter villains acted mostly as a device to add some combat to the movie, making their inclusion feel unnecessary overall. The final climax of the film was a mixed bag as well. Some felt as though the change in aesthetic and decision to conclude the film with an idol performance was out of place, whilst other jurors felt as though it was a fitting end to a *Precure* film.

While the disjointed nature received mixed reception, most jurors enjoyed the movie structuring its narrative around diverse groups of guests of the inn. Each guest (and other major cast members) represents loss in their own way, and it’s through their interactions with Okko that they recover from their loss and help Okko do the same.

          "writeup": "The big takeaway from *Futari no Hero* was that it was unabashedly a superhero spinoff film. Complete with dubious canonicity, fun fanservice in the form of references to the series, and a flashy finale, the movie was an enjoyable experience for fans of the series. Unfortunately, the film perhaps leaned too hard into the tropes, bringing with it a lack of development and an arguably excessive amount of flashbacks. The production was at best on par with the series, though some jurors did praise the final battle for being visually a cut above the rest of the film.\n\nReception of the new characters was mixed. Melissa was particularly divisive, with some finding her shallow while others found her personality charming and likeable. Still others found her character quirkless nature an interesting thematic thread that further developed the world of *Boku no Hero Academia*. David, on the other hand, was widely appreciated for the perspective he offered - his moral dilemma of the ethicality of committing crimes for the sake of preserving the Symbol of Peace was a highlight of the film.\n\nSimilarly, All Might’s past received positive comments and jurors wished the movie gave those scenes more focus and development. One thing that the jury as a whole seemed to notably dislike was the villain, who was considered a psyche-out villain. This was particularly egregious since the jury did not appreciate the ‘twist’ that he was just a pawn in All-For-One’s ploys. All in all, *Futari no Hero* managed to achieve its modest goals, but this lack of ambition meant it suffered in comparison to other films released this year.",

We were impressed with the movie’s pacing and focus on realistically depicting what it’s like being on a vacation, and found that there was never really a dull moment. \n\nThe more lighthearted moments of the movie, including when the group splits and goes snorkeling and kayaking, were just a blast to watch. *Non Non*’s situational comedy has always been a positive and it was especially strong here. The characters from the series are charming and it carries over tremendously in the movie, with a good chunk of *Vacation* spreading out the screen time among them. However, the emotional crux of the movie was Natsumi’s arc, and her newfound friendship with Aoi was notably well executed.\n\nOn the production side, the immersion in the movie is second to none; the inviting atmosphere coupled with a relatable scenario meant that it was very easy for most of us to get invested. The ambience in *Vacation* is inviting particularly thanks to the stunning background art and mellow OST. All in all, this was a strong year for movies, but because of its charm and poignant storytelling we found 'Non Non Biyori: Vacation* to be a cut above the rest, earning it first place overall.",

The well thought-out structure of the film enabled an engaging set-up and payoff, with that payoff being one of the best looking and most exciting fight scenes in 2019. *Broly* and his backstory was very solid and well-rounded, with understandable motives and goals, while never feeling too obnoxious with its exposition. Then the creme de la creme of the film was the long, over-the-top battle between our main characters, which garnered praise for its creative and distinct audiovisuals, as well as great choreography.\n\nHowever,* Broly* wasn't flawless. Some of the narrative beats in the first half in particular came off as rather contrived, and Goku's backstory mostly felt out of place and the film could've survived without it. Some jurors also thought that the final fight itself overstayed its welcome, especially in the last phase when the adrenaline from the encounter started to slowly wear off, making the ending of the battle rather dull for some. But all in all, *Dragon Ball Super: Broly* ended up being a fun and generally acclaimed movie which just fumbled in its execution a few times too many for it to end up being higher in the final rankings.",

          "writeup": "*Seishun Buta Yarou wa Yumemiru no Yume wo Minai* was the widely anticipated sequel to the popular 2018 anime series. The film upped the stakes from the original, took a deeper dive into a mysterious girl’s unresolved backstory, and brought back fan favorite characters as well. \n\nFrom a character perspective, the movie had more dramatic weight and payoff by closing the door on Sakuta’s previously established guilt that’s been built up over the series. Sakuta’s relationship with Mai was consistently engaging and one of the film’s strongest points. But, while Shouko’s arc stood front and center, there was more debate about whether she was a tactful portrayal of a girl struggling with terminal illness or simply a plot device in Sakuta’s story. \n\nNarratively, the film felt a bit unfocused. Seeing the whole cast of the show returning in some form or fashion throughout was nice, but at the same time, it took a lot of screen time away from the main three. This uneven pace caused some emotional beats to feel rushed, and the climax in particular felt unnecessarily contrived and confusing. Especially so when the movie was supported by art direction and animation that was completely indiscernible from the original show, as opposed to an improvement expected from a sequel movie.\n\nWhen looking at the anime films 2019 gave us, *Yumemiru Shoujo* certainly made enough of an impact to earn a spot at the table. Unfortunately, shared criticisms about its structure, narrative, and overall production quality ultimately kept the jury from placing it any higher.",

Mysteries are revealed, ideals are challenged, and despair takes center stage as plot points set up from *Prestige Flower* start to come to a head.\n\nShirou and Sakura receive ample development that puts their characters in a brand new light. Sakura finally reveals the struggles and suffering she went through, and Shirou must make decisions that go against his entire philosophy. Their actions affect the entire grail war in new and interesting ways, setting the stage for final showdowns to take place in the third movie. Visually, the movie is breathtaking, with Ufotable’s trademark compositing and visual effects creating stunning action scenes. Additionally, Tomonori Sudou uses creative set-pieces to uniquely adapt the material to explore the mindsets of Shinji, Shirou, and Sakura in particular, and to fully emphasize their emotional turning points throughout the film. \n\nThe jury was largely a fan of the new directions these movies have taken the story and feel that it makes characters like Sakura and Shirou more interesting compared to their previous versions. One major drawback was how the story is clearly further set up for movie 3 and does not have a definitive conclusion. They feel a lot of choices made for the story can not be fully evaluated until they are paid off. But the journey is also just as important as the destination, and this journey was good enough to earn *Lost Butterfly* 3rd place this year in the movie category.",

Without the obligation to adapt any source material, we had some of the most interesting and unique shows of the year to judge. The latest incarnation of *PreCure* went into the awards with quite some support, and *Saranzanmai* had a lot of eyes on it from the start, as an Ikuhara production tends to do so. But more unexpected entries like Studio Ponoc's *Modest Heroes* made a good impact, and most of the rankings were quite tightly contested.\n\nIt's not really a secret that most of the anime industry is in the business of adapting stories to the medium, and this category celebrates the ones that buck that trend. The existence of anime that were created with the small screen in mind from the start is important to the medium. These are our rankings of the best of these shows.",

Being a collection of three shorts, it made up for its lack of length and continuity with the sheer individual quality of its three adventures. We were pleased by the aesthetic and narrative diversity each short brought to the table. *Kanini & Kanino* brought us the story of a small crab family trying to survive among nature’s hardships. *Life ain’t gonna Lose* tells a more ordinary tale of a mother and son dealing with an egg allergy. *Invisible* wraps it all up with a humble tale of a man grappling with his intangibility and inability to interact with those around him. Each short, on top of possessing its own particular art style, tells its own unique story of what it means to be a “modest hero”.  \n\nWhile *Modest Heroes* received praise for its varied styles and competent storytelling, there was also general agreement that the first short, *Kanini & Kanino* wasn’t quite of the same quality in comparison with the other two. The ghibli-esque underwater backgrounds were aesthetically pleasing, but there was a strong sentiment among the jury that the crab siblings battling against the forces of nature was not quite as compelling as the other more character-driven shorts. Regardless, the quality between the three was more than enough to earn *Modest Heroes* second place among the jury’s picks for best Original.",

          "writeup": "The *Natsume* movie snuck into this category as an original story set in the world of the series’ source material, and it fits right in. The appeal of the series, its characters, and its themes is ever-present, with some slight visual polish, along with new characters and stories that feel right at home. A central theme of memories and the cascading impact of connections forms the narrative base of the story, with special focus on new characters, Yurie and Mukuo as a yokai phenomenon falsifies memories. The movie uses several other side-stories, such as a flashback exploring Natsume’s relationship with a classmate, and the hijinks of Nyanko-sensei being split into three, to fill out its runtime, and manages to tie all of the threads back together neatly in the end. It looks and sounds like the TV show, down to the excellent voice acting, and appeals to any fan of the series.\n\nThe biggest issue with the movie was simply its format, considering that it did very little to distinguish itself as such, beyond an extended duration that was a source of criticism. *Utsusumi ni Musubu* feels entirely doable in TV format, perhaps with an even stronger impact. In its current form, it fails to hit the highest highs of the TV show, and feels stretched a little thin over its 104 minutes. Format aside though, the *Natsume* movie is a welcome addition to the series with a pleasant and well-written new story, and lands solidly in the upper middle of the rankings.",

Precure* tactfully deals with mature themes that ground the conflict in the show, simplifying the message for its target demographic, while still resonating with its older audience. Our heroines are well fleshed out characters with fun and varied personalities, each with traumas of the past and dreams for the future. All of this ties into *Hugtto* ’s main themes of having a positive outlook towards the future, empathy, motherhood, gender roles and work culture. While *Hugtto* was recognized for its outstanding PreCures, Saaya received mixed reception, due to spending minimal time with the characters involved in her drama and development. On the flip side, Hariham Harry and Criasu Corporation along with its inclusive villains, were all beneficial for *Hugtto* ’s main themes.\nAlthough some jurors found *Hugtto* ’s episodic storytelling repetitive, this structure allowed the show to explore different themes each episode, while the Oshimaida granted our heroes an opportunity to break through their inner conflict, providing most episodes with satisfying closure befitting of a weekly anime aimed at kids. Visually, *Hugtto* has colorful backgrounds and characters and while the visuals dipped noticeably at points, it had some stand-out moments in the animation department. On the contrary, the use of cheap-looking 3D assets of anything marketable was unanimously criticized by the jury.\nOverall, *Hugtto* is an optimistic and forward-thinking show, with some of the category’s highest highs. Ultimately, its stronger elements shore up its lack of consistency, earning it a respectable 3rd place.",

The supernatural elements are used as a plot device for introspection as we witness Kun bond with people and learn to be a little less self-centered. The cast comes with ample charm and personality, though a common complaint among the jury happened to be Kun’s obnoxious character, partly due to his very young age. *Mirai* does a good job of presenting its themes, however it falls victim to the redundancy of presenting the same themes multiple times, with Kun having the same character development thrice over. This ended up making the movie feel like three episodes disjointedly taped onto each other.\nThe animation, art, cinematography and direction of *Mirai* are top-tier when scenes are viewed individually, but as a whole, the narrative provides nothing particularly new or compelling. While *Mirai* successfully manages to give us some truly heartwarming scenes viewed in isolation (e.g. scenes with Kun’s great grandfather), when judged overall the film comes off as vague and messy. The train scene in particular being a good example, where the production is of impressive quality, but the writing comes off as a jumbled mess where Kun is manipulated into acknowledging Mirai as his sister. But despite these flaws, *Mirai no Mirai* manages to give us an experience that feels both real and impactful. The film has a genuine sense of warmth in its simplicity, and what it lacks in polish, it makes up for in sincerity.",

          "writeup": "A wonderful surprise at the end of 2019, *Hoshiai No Sora* was a story of incredible ambition and passion for animated storytelling, unfortunately cut down in its prime due to corporate mishandling. From a production standpoint, the director, Kazuki Akane’s uncompromising desire for visual quality is on full display. Employing a softer aesthetic, *Hoshiai*’s animation, cinematography, compositing, and everything else are excellently wrought. Akane utilizes this production quality to expand on the cast and their journey with the club through impressive visual storytelling. Almost equally as ambitious is the story that the show seeks to tell. Employing a large and distinct cast, *Hoshai* does an admirable job weaving its tale of broken people finding solace in a second family, as well as deftly approaching sensitive topics like gender identity.  Yet unfortunately, the narrative is where the show started to unravel for some of the jury. Many felt that the improbable overabundance of abusive parents and the extreme nature of the dramatic narrative that followed was unable to mesh properly with the separate storyline of the soft tennis club, and created a split in focus between the two that was difficult to reconcile emotionally.\n\nOf course, it is impossible to ignore the elephant in the room; *Hoshiai*’s utter lack of an ending.  While much of the jury appreciated Akane and his staff’s desire to not compromise on the narrative, the inconclusive nature of the ending was unpalatable to many as it left the audience on a cliffhanger and even further ramped up the stakes that only enhanced the issues many already had with how the dramatic elements had played out until then. We can only hope that Akane can one day finish the story that he wanted to tell.",

Key cast overlaps such as that of Aqua fighting Ainz, Kazuma and Subaru's petty rivalry, and Tanya and Ainz's mutual respect as leaders of battle, highlight times the show can achieve memorable cast dynamics. On a production front, the simplification of character designs through the chibi art-style allowed shows of quite distinctly varied styles to be more cohesive visually, although in general, the jurors felt that it ultimately came across as lacking animation. Scenes involving characters felt like a lot of stills of them standing around, with sliding movement across each scene, which made a smart decision go unfulfilled in what it could achieve for the show's comedy. More generally in terms of cast, the jury found some early decisions awkward, consequently leading to less cohesion. For instance, *Overlord*’s over-representation and *Youjo Senki*’s under-representation led to cast imbalance that meant characters often didn’t get the attention they needed. In addition to this, many jurors found the show often resorted to uninteresting shout-y comedy rather than being creative with its characters and history. Furthermore, the re-use of gags, gimmicks, and jokes from the original shows without much change-up felt like further padding of the show's runtime which left less room for original humor. These factors combined led to *Isekai Quartet* being somewhat disappointing for the jurors, despite its peaks, making it lose out to the year’s stronger entries.",

The surrounding buzz around two girls dreaming of making their mark on the music industry one songwriting session at a time was quite a palpable narrative. It marked the return of a visionary auteur at the helm with Studio Bones, included a variety of musicians and artists on a global level, and was structured around an ambitious narrative filled with a diverse and colorful cast. *Carole and Tuesday*’s dreams of stardom are a tried and true staple of storytelling, but nothing about this production, filled with wonderful moments on a grand and intimate scale, felt generic.\n\nDespite the early promise of an entertaining first cour however, most of the jury’s criticisms were found in the underwhelming second half. While starting off strong by introducing compelling story threads and character arcs, many of those same threads disappointed us by the end. The simplistic take on overarching themes of unity in the face of hate, as well as the integration of complicated political and economic ideas, offered few new insights or satisfying solutions. The tension between the spirit of human creativity vs the apparent “necessity” of artificial intelligence, most prominently explored through Angela’s fast-track rise and fall, also came across as half-baked.\n\nUltimately, these narrative criticisms could not be completely overlooked for *Carole & Tuesday* to rise to the top of the list. However, that still doesn’t take away from the show’s charming cast or stunning achievement of gorgeous animation and top-notch music production.",

Like most of Ikuhara's works, the quirky and eccentric nature of the show creates an engaging experience while keeping the plot straightforward despite its usage of symbolism. One of the show’s biggest strengths is weaving a strong narrative in the midst of its repeated motifs. Many jurors also found its bizarre and intangible nature to be one of its biggest appeals but that is far from the only thing the show has to offer.\n\nWith ‘connection’ as a central theme, the show takes its time to flesh out each main character. Every character in *Sarazanmai* is deeply flawed and wishes to connect with the people they love. Through individual character arcs and emotional backstories, *Sarazanmai* delivers on a fantastic character-driven narrative paired with a well thought-out script and organic character interactions, ultimately resulting in an incredibly enjoyable experience. The production is also nothing to be scoffed at while the usage of wide colour palette fits the show and its quirky nature. Thanks to the fluid animation, the visuals never feel off by even a margin and complement the show’s narrative particularly well. On the other hand, the jury was split on the bank footage, though many still appreciated the variation even within the reused animation.\n\nUltimately, *Sarazanmai* managed to surpass our expectations and created a unique and colourful experience despite its shortcomings, therefore taking its rightful place as the category winner.",

In its first year being recognized by the r/anime Awards, the sports genre has showcased both the classic flair and modern appeal which comes with the wide variety of sports anime this year. Character's lives were reflected in the sports they engaged in, and many compelling character dramas were showcased through both athleticism and competition in 2019. While the selection was small in the genre, there was no shortage of shows which the jury recognized as having potential for nomination, and as such this tiny but competitive genre was just as strong in the game as any other.",

While it doesn’t have the strongest visual presentation, it makes up for this in spades with a clear passion for baseball, as well as an enjoyable set of characters. This cast of characters allows the show to craft a strong straight-forward sports narrative with a solid balance between both dramatic and relaxed moments. This is in no small part because of the relationships and interactions between the characters. Relationships in *Mix* aren’t positive or negative, but instead have a mix of good and bad – and interactions between characters manage to be fun and entertaining. The show also garnered praise for its character designs, which managed to maintain old school sensibilities without feeling out-of-touch. However, this show doesn’t manage to entirely escape the trappings of the more old-school style. The show’s comedy in particular may not land with all audiences – some of the humor felt outdated, most notably jokes regarding fanservice. \n\nAll in all, *Mix* might not be as fancy as a lot of modern sports anime, but it manages to shine due to solid down-to-earth storytelling and a well-crafted narrative.",

          "writeup": "*Tsurune* was a sports anime that very much boasted Kyoto Animation’s well-known attention to aesthetic detail from its high quality animation to its breathtaking backgrounds and scenery. The delicate and meticulous attention to the art can be seen in each bow firing - the audience can see the tension building from the string to the archer's muscles and can feel the release and soaring speed of the arrow. The subject of the show tackled kyuudou from a novel angle, exploring the main character Minato’s struggle to overcome a real condition called *target panic*. The show also aims to explore and develop the relationships between its many characters and the dynamics and histories that connect them. It explores the impact that archery has had on the friendship between Minato and Seiya, as well as the strain it caused between Masaki and his grandfather. \n\nThe jury’s main critique with the show is that some of the characters still felt one-dimensional, being introduced but never developed outside of their personality tropes. In addition, we also felt that the plot progression was slow at times, and it was hard to see where the story would lead the characters by the end. The jury also felt that the climax of the show of the last tournament could have been more fulfilling. Due to the rushed introduction of a rival school and Minato’s unclear, inconsistent improvement with his condition for most of the anime, the climax of the show felt flat. Nevertheless, *Tsurune* is still an enjoyable watch because of marvelous artistic direction and its exploration of an interesting sport, earning it a place as one of the better sports animes this year.\n",

Each member of the tennis club has a distinct personality that’s easy to empathize with and track in terms of development. Seeing how they act at home with their varying family situations compared to in the tennis club makes the characters seem more layered. It also makes it more satisfying when they open up to each other and grow closer as a group.\n\nWhile the abundance of abusive parents can be explained through how people in similar circumstances tend to group together, some jurors felt the show went slightly overboard, undermining the realistic angle the show is going for. There is a wide representation of different forms of mental and physical abuse, but a couple of the conflicts feel rushed, resulting in almost comedic levels of drama and inhuman perpetrators. We respect the director's decision of cutting the show in half, as rushing a narrative with this many key actors and plot lines would result in an incomprehensible mess.\n\n*Hoshiai* 's expressive character designs and animation, coupled with solid cinematography, does a great job getting the characters feelings across without the need for dialogue. This both enhances the emotional moments and makes the tennis matches more engaging. Despite getting butchered by production, *Hoshiai no Sora* is supported by its endearing cast, earning it a respectable 3rd place.\n",

          "writeup": "Among a set of largely ensemble-driven sports series, *Run with the Wind* stands out as the one with the most well-developed characters and narrative. Despite some stumbles at the starting line while getting the group together, *RWTW* quickly picked up its pace as the ensemble cast became more and more developed, both as individual characters with each their own motivations on why they run, and also the bond formed between members of the team. The show strikes a great balance between being charming, inspiring and exciting while still largely keeping a grounded tone and aesthetic through IG’s neat character design and animation style. The series is also backed up by an excellent OST that boosts the inspiring and uplifting sound of the series at every turn. The series is not entirely without hiccups, as the show gets ahead of itself a bit in its final arc as the runners start to outperform what is reasonably possible for amateurs of their level. However the series’ uplifting ‘dare to dream’ attitude and engaging team bonding helped overshadow the fact that it might not be fully realistic, and the jury near unanimously found great joy in rooting for the success of the cast.",

As a jury, we all really liked the public list.  While not all of the shows are the same, we appreciated the fire foley in *Fire Force* and *Kimetsu no Yaiba* just barely missed the cut on our list.  And after all these years the ODM gear in *Attack on Titan* still sounds phenomenal.\n\nWe were particularly happy with our own list as it highlights four shows with a broad spectrum of stellar sound design  While there was a clear divide in the ranks between first and second, and third and fourth, it was more due to stylistic preference and the sheer brilliance and novelty of our top two than an indictment on our bottom two.  We look forward to the discussion these lists will bring and hopefully to another year of great-sounding anime.",

In the real world it uses its foley carefully to immerse the viewer in its world. Each footstep can be subtly and individually heard, and every action, like the sound of a crackling fire, a bubbling pot, or a creaking door, is given painstaking detail. All the sounds here are recreated as true to life as possible.\n\nIn the dream world, sounds are treated differently, with a more fantasised effect. The flap of a bird’s wings becomes a thunderous roar while the sounds of the real world like footsteps are rendered silent. Even as the girl begins to slip into this dream the sound of the bubbling pot slowly morphs into boiling lava. When the girl is brought out of the dream world it is with abrupt but mundane sounds of everyday life like a bowl falling on the floor or a cup being put down.\n\nThe only real drawback the jury could find was that the sound effects were not as intense or dramatic as other nominees in the category, like *Kotobuki* or *JoJo*. For these reasons, the jury put *Totsukuni* in second place.",

However, *Kouya no Kotobuki Hikoutai* sets its sights clearly on a faithful recreation of the aural experience of real-life combat pilots. As such, it strives at every moment to deliver the most detailed and true-to-life audio of piloting World War II-era aircraft. There is a tenacity to all of the aerial combat effects that captures the grimy, creaky reality of operating these fighters. The authenticity of these sounds is consistent throughout the anime, which is doubly impressive considering that aerial combat composes between a third and a half of *Kotobuki* 's total runtime.\n\nCareful attention is paid to the layering and filtering of audio in every moment. The change in the engines’ pitch is clearly audible when transitioning between climbing, diving, and flying level. Upon entering clouds, the higher pitches of the engine noise are dampened but the roar grows louder as it reverberates off the water droplets around the craft. When a plane is under enemy fire, some shots rip through the covering while others can be heard ricocheting off the frame. On top of it all, the sounds are bespoke for each model of aircraft; no two models sound the same. The confluence of these minute details produces a feeling of absolute immersion in every plane scene, unrivaled by any other anime released in 2019. *Kotobuki *deservedly stands as this year’s Sound Design winner.",

While not as technically impressive as the other nominees, the careful attention to using sound as an element of humor ensured that it earned its spot on this list. The show frequently engages in fast-paced comedy sequences where the jokes fly by at high speed. In these instances, the sounds serve to punctuate the humor and direct the viewer's attention to punchlines or background jokes that might otherwise slip past unnoticed. The choice to sometimes use voice actor performances for sounds in place of foley resulted in some especially funny moments.\n\nThe sound design doesn't slack off in the show's quieter moments either; environmental foley is solid and the show always manages to work in some quirky effects to keep the soundscape from becoming too bland during these segments. However, the effects for each particular object (Shamiko's tail, question marks, speech bubbles) aren't sufficiently varied to keep them from feeling worn out at times. The 8-bit sounds sprinkled throughout the show, while innovative in their inclusion, suffer from the same problem of occasional overuse. *Machikado Mazoku* does quite a bit right in its sound design but falls short of the more compelling entries in this category.",

Script in 2019 showed us a good amount of strong writing that was able to shine not only in the jury’s list but also in the public’s opinion as well, and hopefully the trend will continue in 2020.",

          "writeup": "*Run With The Wind* was one of the standout scripts of the year, featuring some nuanced characters and a great sports story. The remarkable part of the show is its cast, weaving 10 different characters together and giving them each unique motivations and development.\n\nUnlike many shows with large casts that don’t utilize their characters properly, *Run With the Wind* is able to get adequate screen time for each of these characters and showcase what running means to them and how running has been able to help them in their own personal lives. It also features well-written dramatic moments that showcase the development and struggles of the main characters - why they feel the way that they do and how that affects their actions. While both Haiji and Kakeru have issues and do things that can make them seem somewhat unlikable at the start, the show does a great job of developing them and showcasing why they became that way.\n\nThe biggest weakness of the script though is the believability of their feat. While the show is pretty realistic and grounded, there are elements of it - like the sports story that it follows - that clashes with this realism and creates a weaker product. Despite this, the show’s script was quite good, and made a great entry for our 3rd best script of the year. ",

He and his mentor Reigen Arataka continue to deal with supernatural requests from clients, whether it be exorcizing evil spirits or tackling urban legends that haunt the citizens.\n\nWhile the workflow remains the same, Mob isn't just blindly following Reigen around anymore. With all his experiences as a ridiculously strong psychic, Mob's supernatural adventures now have more weight to them. Things take on a serious and darker tone as the dangers Mob and Reigen face are much more tangible and unsettling than ever before.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

          "writeup": "*Beastars* is a character drama, so it is only fitting that the jury’s favorite part of the series was the characters and their dynamics. The slow reveal of Louis' cracks in his firm demeanor and Haru’s development of independence were some notable highlights, but it was Legoshi's growth as a character that was truly remarkable. Watching him grow from a timid wolf into someone who acts on what he believes in is truly a sight to behold.\n\nWhat sets the cast of *Beastars* apart from other series is the depth and realization of the characters; it’s never possible to boil down the main cast into a few specific traits. Since character motivations are never clearly stated, they can only be inferred from phrasing, line delivery, and body language. And, the instant you think you have figured out a character or their dynamic with others, they grow and their dynamics change.\n\nThe jury agreed that the world as a whole was intriguing and well thought out, taking social pressures and even politics into account. The overall pacing of the story was solid, never feeling too fast or too slow. However, as much as the jury praised the cast and world, they noted that less narratively important members of the cast were sidelined and left to stagnate, while the main cast was developed instead. Still, in a year with such strong narratives as this one, *Beastars* fully earned its strong 2nd place finish.",

          "writeup": "2019 was a momentous year for anime scripts, full of enigmatic pieces that contained either good worldbuilding, character arcs, or thematic storytelling. Among all of these stories, *Vinland Saga* has managed to touch upon all three elements in such a manner that resonated with people to a refined level.\n\nThe show’s stark attention to detail in its setting, such as the common lifestyles of citizens of different cultures or the Viking traditions of the Danish, really adds up to bring the world to life pragmatically. The character arcs throughout the story are engaging and range in detail: Thorfinn’s tragic fall from his upbringing, Canute’s actualization of kingship, Thorkell’s search to follow Thors’ path of enlightenment, and Askeladd’s vivid arc of revenge and personal redemption. In particular, Askeladd’s arc is the most compelling of the pack, due to how the story manages to subtly reveal and flesh out his character through good pacing and dialogue.\n\nBut the biggest element of the story would have to be the thematic motifs that the author Makoto Yukimura and scriptwriters Hiroshi Seko/Khenta Ihara have worked to get across: the futility of revenge and how violence leaves for an unfulfilling life. The show expresses these themes through how it mirror’s Thorfinn’s character arc against the cast’s own experiences and resolutions, with perhaps Askeladd having the biggest impact on that theme.\n\nIt’s through these strong elements that *Vinland Saga* managed to secure its place as jury’s choice for best script of the year in a tough competition filled with worthy contestants.",

          "writeup": "From its initial release, *Attack on Titan* was shrouded with mystery. With its latest installment however, most of the questions about the plot were answered. The worldbuilding was incredibly praiseworthy thanks to the show organically connecting most of the loose beats from previous installments. By giving out subtle answers for all the questions we had before with each scene alongside excellent flashback usage, the show’s lore was ultimately enriched. How the show fleshed out both sides of the conflict also deserves a nod. Through well-planned pacing, the show allowed the audience to see a new perspective of the world and to understand the ulterior motives of each side while not sacrificing depth of the plot.\n\nWhile the overall reception was positive, unfortunately the structure of this season was a divisive topic since the jury was split on which half had less problems going for it. The quality of the cast as a whole was also an issue: some characters gained a stronghold on the spotlight this season while other side characters were given little room to grow, resulting in their underdevelopment. Still, the jury found the show’s exploration of the cast’s dilemmas to be intriguing and tastefully done, which is why it earned a spot amongst our nominations.\n\nIn the end, we decided to put this iteration of *Attack on Titan* in fourth place on our list. While delivery on some parts was on point, it was the show’s shortcomings that prevented us from placing it higher.",

Enter *Cencoroll 2*, a film taking pieces from the first (along with some new aspects) and stitching them together to create a coherent narrative, a reasonably realized world, and more fleshed-out characters. Gaps in knowledge about the octopi and world are filled diegetically by the addition of Kaname and Gotoda, and the protagonists undergo fuller character arcs. All in all, Cencoroll 2 represented a marked improvement over the original story despite its limited timeframe, and thus rightfully earned an honorable mention from the jury.",

Arataka’s redemption fits into his subversive role, as it starts with soliciting an innocent boy’s help to lie to the public, but ends on a wholesome conversation.
